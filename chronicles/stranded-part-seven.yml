    takes seventy-two hours,\u201D a bored looking lab coat tells me, \u201Cfor all
    cognitive, memory and motor functions to be mapped and routed through the neuro-interface
    socket implanted in your head.\u201D The NIS is a fountain of metal spouting out
    my skull. Bulky and uncomfortable, the weight of it makes it difficult to keep
    my head up straight. \u201CA temporary solution until the procedure is complete,\u201D
    says the coat when I complain.\n\n\u201CAnd what happens when the procedure is
    complete?\u201D I ask.\n\nHe gives me a look of practiced annoyance that says
    this will be less painful for both of us if I stop asking questions. I shut up
    and with a weary sigh he goes back to work.\n\nIt\u2019s hours before I\u2019m
    allowed to return to my quarters. I don\u2019t see it until I\u2019m almost on
    top of it. Lying in the middle of the floor is a gun, and underneath it, a handwritten
    note with just two words on it: KILL YOURSELF. I would learn, much later, that
    seven days is the maximum allotted time for a recruit to commit suicide and complete
    the procedure. Anyone who fails to do so is removed from the program permanently.
    They could kill you, of course. A single pill or injection would be far more efficient.
    Instead, they had you do it yourself. It\u2019s a test, the first of many.\n\nEvery
    day starts the same. I put the gun in my mouth, and bite down hard. I stay that
    way until my teeth start to hurt and my fingers cramp. Then I put the gun down,
    get dressed and go out. \u201CTomorrow,\u201D I promise myself. \u201CTomorrow.\u201D\n\n\u201CSelf-preservation
    is the basest of instincts. Only by subverting the will to live can you truly
    become immortal.\u201D The words of an aging Sebiestor that looks as though he
    fought with life and lost. I\u2019m sure he thought it profound. Old as he is,
    he steps aside as I move past, bowing slightly as he does so. I realize then how
    old I must look, wheelchair bound, head bowed by the weight of the NIS, wrapped
    in medical-grade mesh. I keep going, guiding my chair along the same narrow path
    I travel each day to and from my quarters, in a body that I can no longer control,
    living less than half a life and I think *why not?* As I near an overpass, one
    of many criss-crossing the wide interior of the facility, I push myself out of
    the chair and over the edge.\n\nIt\u2019ll be instantaneous, I assure myself as
    I fall. It isn\u2019t. I feel my bones snap on impact - jaw pulverized, shards
    of teeth exploding outwards, shredding tissue like so many tiny flechettes, ribs
    cracking and caving inwards, impaling spleen and liver and lungs \u2013 like a
    giant fist exploding through my torso. And through it all, the NIS watches silently,
    recording, remembering.\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nI
    wake up in a body that feels wrong. The arms are too long, and the feet too large.
    I stand- *I stand!* - the momentary joy of feeling my legs shift beneath me is
    flushed away when I see the person staring at me. It takes a moment to realize
    that I\u2019m looking at myself. Where before my skin was the color of an afternoon
    sandstorm, it\u2019s now pale, almost gray. I stare in disbelief through cataract
    white eyes. The NIS is smaller than before, not quite round and bored so deep
    into my skull it\u2019s almost flush with my skin. My skin is impossibly smooth.
    Gone are the rough scars on my back, the hard won trophies of a long life, so
    too, the deep lines time had etched into my face.\n\n*I\u2019m a 200-pound albino
    infant.*\n\nNaked and angry, I go looking for answers.\n\n\u201CA stock clone,\u201D
    the coat screams, as I throw him bodily across the room. And then from behind
    the safety of a flashing terminal, \u201Ce-everyone gets a stock clone to-to keep
    costs down.\u201D I already know this. Have already heard it from at least three
    other people as I punched my way up the chain of command in search of Vantus who
    seems to suddenly have become too busy to see me. I\u2019m no more than I\u2019ve
    always been: a grunt. A blunt instrument. They\u2019ve gotten what they need from
    me. They have the technology to give me an exact replica of my original body.
    They\u2019d simply chosen not to. It\u2019s a decision that has the stink of bureaucracy
    all over it.\n\nThe full meaning of his words only become apparent the next day
    when I\u2019m introduced to my new squad: Gastun, Cala, and Krin. Each of their
    faces mirrors my own; the same cadaverous skin, bald head and lifeless eyes.\n\nWe\u2019re
    outside. The first time I\u2019ve seen sun in weeks.\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re the
    jumper!\u201D Krin is the first to speak.\n\n\u201CShut up, idiot. That\u2019s
    our sergeant.\u201D Cala now, trying to rebuke Krin discretely and failing miserably.\n\n\u201CSir!\u201D
    Gastun mimes a stiff salute.\n\nAt least our voices are unique, I think to myself.\n\nIn
    the days that follow, I come to learn more about the men under my command. Like
    me, Krin had been a Valklear. Only in his third year, he had been one of hundreds
    to volunteer for Vantus\u2019 program. He is quick-witted with an even quicker
    temper. I make a mental note to find out what got him into the Valklears in the
    first place. Gastun had worked for a Gallentean private security firm. He doesn\u2019t
    speak much, and because of that people assume he\u2019s stupid. I imagine that
    in his previous life he must have been a mountain of a man. Cala was... is, a
    woman. Fiercely patriotic, she had jumped at the chance to be among the first
    of the Republic\u2019s new breed of soldier. Unlike the rest of us, she knew they
    would put her into a stock male body. They had explained it to her probably in
    the hopes that it would dissuade her from going through with it. She agreed to
    the procedure anyway, which, they must have figured, made her just the right kind
    of crazy for the job. I suppose in some way, we all were.\n\n<div align=\"center\"
    style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nWe train with live rounds.\n\n\u201CSupposed
    to desensitize us to the pain!\u201D Krin hisses, as he injects biofoam sealant
    into the wound in his stomach. \u201CNewsflash, assholes! A bullet hurts no matter
    how many times you get hit with one.\u201D\n\nPain is constant. It\u2019s in everything
    we touch, everything we do. It cannot be avoided, never goes away, but it can
    be ignored. A round catches me in the shoulder, goes clean through. *Pain is temporary,
    it will pass,* I recite. Instinctively, I pivot and shoot, a red spray of mist
    telling me what I knew even before I pulled the trigger. But I\u2019ve only bought
    us time. He\u2019ll be back.\n\nIt\u2019s our second live-fire drill in as many
    days. And this time we\u2019re outnumbered; it\u2019s us against three other squads.
    They\u2019ve got us pinned down sixty yards out from our objective, with nothing
    but open land from here to there. A man-portable autocannon whirs to life over
    the ridge, and above the whine Gastun\u2019s voice, \u201Cthey\u2019re trying
    to flank us!\u201D\n\nWe\u2019re running out of time.\n\nI scan the trees. They\u2019re
    out there, waiting.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s a suicide run. We\u2019ll be cut down before
    we set foot anywhere near that beacon,\u201D says Cala, following my gaze. \u201CAnd
    Krin\u2019s in no shape to go anywhere.\u201D\n\n\u201CHell I am. I can make it.\u201D\n\nBehind
    us, gunfire, and then the hurricane-roar of the cannon abruptly stops. They\u2019ve
    got Gastun.\n\n\u201CWe have to go. NOW.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\n\n\u201CAre
    you insane?\u201D\n\nI ignore both of them.\n\n\u201CCala, cover me.\u201D\n\n\u201CSorry,
    Krin,\u201D I say, as I hoist him up by the collar and, ignoring his protests,
    half-carry, half-push him out into the open. A single shot *zinks* out of the
    trees and strikes him center mass. Followed by another, and then another. We keep
    moving, shots coming in like light rain on a tin roof.\n\nKrin screams as the
    first few rounds puncture his body, but soon it\u2019s nothing more than a wet
    gurgle, and before long all that remains is the soft, wet *puck!* of each new
    round tearing into his lifeless flesh.\n\nWe\u2019re thirty yards out when desperation
    gets the better of them. They emerge from the trees firing and that\u2019s when
    Cala starts to pick them off one-by-one. *Ten.* I drop Krin\u2019s corpse and
    sprint the last few yards towards the beacon, the exhilaration of running, the
    feel of stretched muscle and the ground beneath my feet spurs me on. I breach
    the perimeter beams triggering the klaxon howl that signals the end of the drill.
    I\u2019m covered in blood, some of it my own, but for now none of that matters.
    It\u2019s over; we\u2019ve won.\n\nIt\u2019s only then that I turn and see the
    carnage wrought. Dead bodies litter the open field Krin and I just crossed; each
    one different, and yet all of them the same. I try not to look at their faces.
    Not for the first time, I wonder just what it is that I\u2019ve gotten myself
    into."
