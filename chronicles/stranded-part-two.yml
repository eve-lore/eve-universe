    should have stayed down.*\n\nA long ago thought. An unwelcome memory worn thin
    by time. I shake my head and the memory drifts loose. I let it go.\n\n*Every story
    has a beginning*, says the voice. *But yours, Traveler, is a story of beginnings.*\n\n\u201CWhat
    the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201D is what I want to say, but can\u2019t
    seem to think of the words. This bothers me, I think, but the thought disappears
    before it can fully form. Around me, the darkness shifts restlessly. It seems
    impossibly tight, the air too thick. Thoughts slip by unnoticed. I want. I want...
    my brain scrambles for something, anything to latch onto. The memory floats up
    out of the darkness, like a bloated corpse bobbing to the surface. And this time,
    like a drowning man, my mind grabs on and doesn\u2019t let go.\n\nI can taste
    my blood. Can feel the grinding murmur of station machinery beneath me. The metal
    is cold against my skin. I need to get to my feet. My head feels impossibly heavy.
    I try to move, but every cell in my body screams in protest. Their laughter chases
    echoes around the corridor. They\u2019re lost in the moment. High on victory and
    adrenaline and whatever else is coursing through their veins. It won\u2019t last
    long though and when it does they will end me. *Get up! Get up! Get up!* I lift
    my head in time to see him turn and start running toward me. The moment comes
    on slowly, moving with the singular inevitability of an iceberg.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t
    expect me to move. Not with the injuries they\u2019ve given me. So when he kicks
    out, I grab his ankle and twist. He yelps, I suspect from surprise more than anything
    else, and then again, this time in pain, as he comes down hard on his hip. I\u2019m
    up and moving then. The pain is a demon harpist, plucking at nerves that sing
    in agony. I reach the first of them, a tattooed Civire, just as he raises his
    weapon. I reach up and grab his wrist, punch him in the throat, and yank down
    hard. The weapon falls loose and bounces out of reach. *Shit.* But he goes down,
    choking. The other two have to move around him, which buys me just enough time
    to throw up a loose guard. I ride the first wave of blows \u2013 *fire erupts
    across my chest* - and kick out hard, hoping for a shin. I feel bone shift, something
    gives and then he\u2019s down and screaming, clutching his knee. I turn, too slow,
    and a punch snaps my head back.\n\nThe world flashes black then white. Too bright.
    I squint and duck instinctively at a shadow, a swing that glances off my shoulder.
    I move for position, almost slip on something \u2013 spit or blood maybe, I wonder
    absently if it\u2019s mine \u2013 but somehow manage to get in close enough to
    lock up an arm. Our eyes meet for a second and I see understanding there. I smile
    through bloody teeth, then jerk his arm straight and bring as much weight down
    on it as I can muster. His elbow shatters, the sick sound of it swallowed by his
    screams. To his credit, he doesn\u2019t go down. He staggers back, cradling his
    arm. When he turns and runs, I almost chase after him in spite of my wounds.\n\nThe
    capsuleer is back on his feet. I wonder how long he\u2019s been watching. He is
    tall and lean and his skin impossibly smooth, except for a designer scar along
    his jaw. What he does next unnerves me more than any threat or slur ever could.
    He starts to laugh. The same free, unburdened laughter I first heard back in the
    bar.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be here. Not in this station. Not in this bar. And
    not chasing ghosts. At first, the raucous laughter is grating, but before long
    I\u2019m listening intently to what\u2019s being said. What was it Tanvalin used
    to say? *The truth of the world can be found at the bottom of a glass.* Even from
    a booth half-way across the room, I can hear the man\u2019s drunken boasts.\n\n\u201CIt
    was a suicide mission and I knew it. But the payout was too good. No way was I
    going to let someone else have a crack at it.\u201D\n\n\u201CFucking capsuleers,\u201D
    mutters a man too young to look that old. \u201CThink they\u2019re so special.\u201D
    He raises his glass and then drops it back down, cursing me under his breath when
    I don\u2019t reciprocate. I\u2019m in no mood to talk. I\u2019m more interested
    in listening to the conversation that I and most of the bar are being subjected
    to.\n\n\u201CAnd your crew?\u201D\n\n\u201CYou know,\u201D he says, lowering his
    voice to a conspiratorial whisper. \u201CI\u2019d completely forgotten about them.\u201D\n\nLaughter.\n\n\u201CSo
    you jettisoned your pod and left them to die?\u201D\n\n\u201CAnd what kind of
    man would I be if I did that! Of course not! I went down with my ship like any
    proper captain should.\u201D\n\nAt that the table erupts in laughter.\n\nI\u2019m
    surprised to find myself pushing my way through the crowd even before he\u2019s
    finished talking. I wonder if this is the sort of person Tanvalin worked for.
    Was it a quick death? No, I don\u2019t believe that. That\u2019s not how the world
    works. Tanvalin suffered. He dared to dream of a better life. Was arrogant enough
    to believe that hard work and determination would get him out. And for his hubris
    he suffered. When the ship\u2019s shields failed, and the armor was gone. When
    all that was left was a wafer-thin hull, naked and exposed, did he panic? Or did
    he trust in the skill and judgment of a single person to save them all? A capsuleer
    into whose hands he and the rest of the crew had placed their lives. A capsuleer
    like this one. Tanvalin always trusted people.\n\nLike most, I know little about
    capsuleers beyond the stories and rumors. But I know they bleed.\n\n\u201CYou
    were a fool, Tan.\u201D I mutter to myself, and charge the capsuleer. He stops
    laughing then.\n\nHe is trained, but not well. He is slow and predictable. I brush
    aside a few half-hearted strikes, break a hold, and smash my forehead down into
    his face. It hurts so badly that for a second I think I might pass out, but the
    satisfaction of feeling bones break keeps me going. He throws a few jabs, short,
    tight motions, catches me in the ribs with one that makes me wheeze. I feel something
    wet in my lungs and the taste of fresh blood in my mouth. He steps in and follows
    up with a knee, but rage and grief have long since carried me over the edge and
    I barely register the hit. I tackle him to the ground. He says something then,
    but I\u2019m already punching and barely hear it.\n\nI imagine Tanvalin in those
    final moments. I want to think of him helping others to lifeboats, screaming orders
    or sealing a breach, working defiantly to the last. But all I can see is my brother\u2019s
    face twisted in pain and fear as round after round tears through the ship\u2019s
    hull, venting metal and bone and blood into space, wondering if the next strike
    will be the one that finally takes him. A faraway klaxon screams in my ears, hollow
    and keening. Tears sting my eyes. I can barely see the capsuleer but every punch
    comes away sticky with blood. I don\u2019t know how long it goes on for, but when
    I open my eyes his face is pulp, and my knuckles raw. It\u2019s only then that
    I hear the klaxon\u2019s ringing for what it really is: the sound of my own screams
    bouncing off the metal walls.\n\nThe memory fades and for a single moment my senses
    are my own. I\u2019m back in the darkness when I hear the voice again.\n\n*You
    have come a long way, Traveler. But your journey is only beginning.*\n\nAnd then
    the darkness swells once more, like the hitched breath of a great beast. I feel
    it rise up, pouring into my mouth and lungs, feel the pressure behind my eyes
    and the sick sensation that I\u2019m being crushed from within.\n\nSitting in
    the transport, staring at the stony faces around me, wondering what lies ahead,
    I can\u2019t help but think that I should have stayed down. Maybe things would
    have been different then. Maybe I\u2019d be with Tanvalin again. *Maybe one day.*
    The restraints cut into my ankles and wrists. In the end the choice had been a
    simple one: prison or the Valklears. That was how I found myself enlisted in the
    most elite fighting force the Minmatar Republic had ever produced. That was how
    I found my life\u2019s calling. And all I had to do was kill a man."
