    think I found it easier to hate them. I had to feel something; being neutral about
    it implied that I did not care enough to form an opinion. Without that, there
    would be no reason or drive to continue. The feeling of hate allowed me to be
    here, to do what needed to be done without pause or contrary thought. I did not
    pity them, though, for I had run short of pity long ago; so much so that I had
    none to give, even for those who needed it.\n\nI watched them jump into the system,
    a deep space system well beyond the effective jurisdiction of the Directive Enforcement
    Department, even beyond many of the usual pirate groups' raiding territories.
    I sat, silently ticking off the reasons for my hate of them, as each one gathered
    into formation and prepared to warp past me. This one had spoken too loudly against
    my proposals in the boardroom, that one had tried to rally support against me
    amongst the investors. More gate activity flashed on my screen; this one had attached
    himself to the coat tails of my eventual successor, another had made a feeble
    attempt at spying on me only to ruin it by approaching too closely... on it went
    down the line, until the last of the thirteen aligned his ship with the destination
    and the fleet began to cycle their warp drives.\n\nThis one, was different...
    this one had been a friend of sorts, someone I had known for many years. Despite
    the years of friendship, countless hours spent working together on vital projects,
    days spent visiting his family, keeping his back at my own expense in times of
    crisis and despair, this one had turned against me, betrayed me to my enemies.
    Could I really hate him? This was not another face I barely knew, another face
    from the board room or the factory floor, or an enemy who had always been a staunch
    advocate of the other side. This was a person I had spent time with, both good
    and bad. I knew the names of his children, who he\u2019d had an affair with in
    the office last year, where he had gone to school and what his favourite lunchtime
    meal was, amongst dozens of other trivial memories.\n\nI knew that it needed to
    be done, that all of them had wronged me, had directly contributed to my loss
    of power, my loss of prestige, and the loss of everything that made me who I was;
    anything beyond that was simply extraneous information, not pertinent to the crime
    for which they were being punished. I knew I could hate every single one of them,
    that they all had to die for their sins to be absolved. I followed them in warp,
    unseen and unheard, to a still-rich asteroid belt not far from the fourth moon
    of the system\u2019s eighteenth planet, where their group of exhumers and cargo
    vessels began the tedious work of stripping the asteroids whilst the combat patrol
    established its barrier. Gliding effortlessly between a pair of cruisers, I sat
    at point blank range from my old friend and sent the all clear message to my new
    friends. I checked my weapons\u2019 and electronic warfare systems\u2019 status
    as the screeching sound of a dozen decloaking recon cruisers filled the system.
    Only 40 rounds per gun: not enough, I thought.\n\nI hate reloading in the middle."
