    (Consolidated Cooperation and Relations Command) is an international assembly
    of regulating bodies founded over a century ago, not long after the five empires
    had established contact with each other. Relations between the five were strained
    right from the beginning, and one of the primary aims of CONCORD was to ease the
    pervasive tension and create a foundation for the empires to work their differences
    out peacefully.\n\nThe organization is branched into numerous divisions, each
    of which handles a certain aspect of the empires\u2019 relations. Of these divisions
    the CAD (Commerce Assessment Department), which oversees interstellar trade agreements
    and regulations, and the DED (Directive Enforcement Department), which oversees
    policing in space, are by far the largest and most influential. Most spacefarers
    will only ever deal with these two departments on any regular basis; to millions
    of people, these two represent the actual face of CONCORD.\n\nThe inner workings
    of CONCORD are democratic in nature, with each of the five empires technically
    possessing equal say in all matters (though a nation\u2019s actual pull more often
    than not will come down to the persuasiveness of its representatives on the debating
    floor). Early on, the Amarrians were adamant that the Minmatar Republic would
    not gain admission to the assembly, but they later reluctantly agreed.\n\nFor
    the first few years of its existence, CONCORD wielded limited power. The fledgling
    organization had little diplomatic sway, and regulation enforcement would time
    and time again prove difficult for its agents. It was not until 18 years after
    its founding that CONCORD gained the respect of the international community. After
    the battle of Iyen-Oursta \u2013 the bloodiest and most costly engagement the
    Gallente-Caldari War had seen in decades \u2013 both sides were tired of fighting,
    though long-entrenched hatred and pride prevented either side from asking for
    a ceasefire. CONCORD took the initiative, and in just under six months managed
    to negotiate a peace accord between these two bitter enemies, one that would endure
    for almost a century.\n\nIn the last two decades the organization\u2019s authority
    increased further, particularly as interstellar trade grew into the cornerstone
    of New Eden\u2019s economy that it is today. The growing power of CONCORD often
    raised concern within the empires that the organization could begin to exercise
    leverage in areas up until then regarded as the nations\u2019 internal affairs.
    No longer simply a neutral ground for the empires to hammer out diplomatic agreements,
    CONCORD had become an independent institution that set its own rules and regulations,
    ones which it was both willing and able to uphold. The organization\u2019s ever-expanding
    bureaucracy had subtly severed its cords over time, so that it swore fealty to
    no nation. The only hold the empires had historically possessed over the organization
    \u2013 that of financial support \u2013 had in addition been almost completely
    erased, as revenues garnered through customs, confiscation of illegal goods, license
    sales and the like were (and still are) more than enough to keep the organization
    in the black.\n\nOn several occasions throughout CONCORD\u2019s history relations
    between the empires deteriorated to within an inch of all-out war but were nursed
    back to health through the organization\u2019s diplomacy and deterrence. Such
    was not to be the case in late YC 110, when a fleet belonging to the Minmatar
    Elders and the Thukker Tribe conducted a strike against the organization\u2019s
    core communications hub, crippling its rapid response teams and enabling the Elders
    to mount a large-scale offensive against the Amarr Empire. This marked the beginning
    of what would become known as the Elder War.\n\nCONCORD was back to a semblance
    of functionality in short order, but the damage was already done; tensions had
    boiled over into conflict. While CONCORD imposed peace enough to maintain the
    status quo and keep New Eden from slipping into anarchy, the hostilities already
    invoked would not be quelled. Using auxiliary forces composed of capsuleer paramilitaries,
    the nations of New Eden today fight a war under the watchful gaze of CONCORD,
    which still struggles to rebuild and redefine itself in the blood-red dawn of
    the Empyrean age. It remains to be seen how \u2013 or, indeed, whether \u2013
    this one-time pillar of New Eden will restore its tarnished reputation."
