    wreckage was still smoking; isolated fires still nurtured contently in hidden
    corners, flowing unnaturally in the zero gravity. Case Omnicron scrutinized the
    debris, focusing briefly on a promising crate or box before moving on. The assailants
    of the large cargo vessel hadn\u2019t left a lot behind. Normally, Case wouldn\u2019t
    stoop so low as to scavenge destroyed ships for scraps, but he made an exception
    this time as the cargo vessel was essentially a fresh carcass. Case had witnessed
    from afar the fierce battle between the cargo ship and the two frigates attacking
    it. The cargo ship put up a surprising amount of resistance, maiming one of the
    heavily armed frigates before going down itself, hinting at lucrative cargo on-board.
    Case had waited for the remaining frigate to finish rummaging through the wreckage,
    as the capsules of the destroyed vessels made their way to the nearest station.
    The reunion of the downed pirate with the crew of the cargo vessel on the station
    would undoubtedly be quite colorful.\n\nFifteen minutes later Case set his course
    away from the wreckage, his azure-colored ship streaking away from the smatter
    of asteroids that encircled the battle scene; he didn\u2019t want to spend too
    much time snooping around in case the pirates or the cargo vessel crew returned
    to the scene. Besides, he had just snatched a cargo container full of valuable
    trade goods and had no intention of getting caught with it. Case considered himself
    a lucky man. Ever since he first set out as the sole captain of a small space
    frigate some six months earlier, it seemed like fortune had smiled upon him. It
    was like he had an uncanny sense of being at the right place at the right time,
    without ever being able to explain this \u2018gift\u2019. Yet he always had a
    nagging feeling that he was somehow wasting his time; that he was meant to be
    doing something far greater and nobler, but was never able to grasp what this
    elusive thing was. As Case aligned his ship towards the nearest stargate, this
    feeling of loss; of being the missing link in some grand inter-stellar puzzle
    devised by an unseen but all-knowing being haunted his thoughts once again. As
    he was about to activate the warp drive, his mind went blank; his unconscious
    body slumped inside the ship\u2019s capsule.\n\nThe two tiny ships approached
    Case's blue vessel at a leisurely pace. Their hulls, if they\u2019d been visible,
    were a multi-colored swirl, like an oil spill. The ships glided silently to either
    side of the larger frigate, complex arrays of sensors prying apart every detail
    about the man and the machine they were focusing on. A quiet conversation between
    the two captains ensued. \u2018Is this the man we want?\u2019 said one. \u2018This
    is him,\u2019 the other replied. \u2018I will start my work.\u2019\n\nThe one
    stood guard, while the other worked in silence. His mind subtly instructed the
    sensors, sending data directly into the mind of the comatose captain within the
    blue ship. It only took a few minutes. \u2018Is it done?\u2019 one said. \u2018It
    is,\u2019 the other said. \u2018I will awake him now.\u2019\n\nThe two captains
    watched as the slightly bewildered Case Omnicron, oblivious to those watching
    him, finally made his way to the stargate. \u2018Has the behavioral pattern been
    aligned correctly?\u2019 asked one. \u2018Yes, he will do much better now,\u2019
    the other answered with pride. Then, the hunter and the repair man, activated
    their own warp drives and started their journey home."
