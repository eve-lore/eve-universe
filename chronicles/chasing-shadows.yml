    Conference Room, Federal Intelligence Office HQ, Renyn system, Essence__\n\n__March
    9th, YC112__\n\n\"So why are we here, exactly?\" asked Candon.\n\n\"Haven't found
    out yet,\" replied Suisse. \"All I know is it's Code 14, top clearance.\" He enunciated
    the next part with careful mocking precision. \"Should see En-Quaitant-do-Mi\xE9rz
    Portres in here soon enough.\" He snapped his finger. \"Yup, there he is. Start
    smiling.\"\n\nPortres was making his way toward them. He was a tall gentleman,
    about fifty years old, and he walked with a purposeful strut that came off just
    a tad too calculated. With a cultured flourish, he took his seat next to the other
    two.\n\n\"Gentlemen.\"\n\n\"Counsel. How are the kids?\" asked Suisse.\n\n\"Oh,
    you know,\" replied Portres. \"Annoying their parents, going against the grain,
    experimenting with trodes and bodymods and what-have-you. It'll pass.\" He placed
    his case on the table in front of him and unclasped it.\n\n\"Any idea why we're
    here?\" asked Candon.\n\n\"Something about a new security directive. I'm not sure,\"
    replied Portres.\n\n\"You'd think they'd brief us properly,\" said Suisse.\n\nPortres
    nodded. \"Yes,\" he said, \"I suppose it was all rather vague and hurried.\" He
    pried his d-pad from the case's foam inlay, placed it on the table in front of
    him and began powering it up. \"Comfortably certain it's all part of a plan, though,\"
    he said, unbuttoning his jacket. \"Let it seldom be said our new President doesn't
    know what he's doing.\"\n\n\"Let it never be thought, much less said,\" muttered
    Candon.\n\nPortres straightened in his chair, smoothed his lapel bottoms. \"Well,\"
    he said, \"at the very least he provides the illusion of knowing what he's doing.
    Right now, maybe that's what we all need. I know he's convinced me so far, and
    I'm a fairly hard man to convince.\"\n\n\"That much is true,\" said Candon. They
    sat there in silence for a few seconds while the meeting table\u2019s holographic
    center cycled through its test patterns.\n\nAbout ten minutes later, with the
    formalities concluded and the heads of the Federal Intelligence Office's fifteen
    major divisions settling somewhat uneasily into their seats, the slight, bald
    figure at the head of the table began to speak.\n\n\"I'm sure most of you gentlemen
    are wondering why you were brought here this afternoon on such short notice, and
    with such dramatic urgency,\" he began. \"Just as I'm sure many of you realize
    that the act of bringing you here in such a way can be an end unto itself.\"\n\nA
    few heads turned around the table, but barely a sound was heard.\n\n\"As of 9:00
    AM this morning, I have issued a presidential directive that places specific orders
    in the hands of each and every one of you. Your dossier pads have been updated
    with the relevant information. Use the holofield to your convenience. As you review
    the data, bear in mind that if even one bit of this information finds its way
    into the wrong hands, the whole operation will come down on your head.\"\n\nHe
    paused for one second, then continued. \"As you will learn, the impromptu Code
    14 meetings will continue for the next two weeks. They are an unfortunate necessity,
    but crucial in the grander scheme.\" He lowered his head. The room was silent.\n\n\"Thank
    you, gentlemen. Please take your time to review your orders. They are effective
    immediately.\" Without another word, he turned, strode away from the table, and
    vanished through a side entrance, the subdued slither of his entourage trailing
    behind him.\n\nCandon and Suisse looked at each other. Portres stared down at
    his d-pad stream. One by one, the three men went to work.\n\n***\n\n__State and
    Region Bank Gala Hall, Jita system, The Forge__\n\n__March 20th, YC112__\n\nThe
    hall was gigantic, tastefully adorned in traditional Caldari style and dotted
    with artistic recreations of State exploits commissioned by the State\u2019s most
    beloved artists. The exclusive crowd in attendance, however, were far more interested
    in the other people around them than in their exorbitant surroundings.\n\n\"Miss
    Omura.\"\n\n\"Mister Kaikumi. Good to see you made it.\"\n\n\"How have things
    been, Miss Omura?\"\n\n\"Copasetic. And with you?\"\n\n\"Staying on an even keel.\"\n\n\"Good
    to hear. I understand you've been expanding into new markets recently?\"\n\n\"Always
    on the prowl. Expansion is the lifeblood of our economy.\" He made a sudden awkward
    shuffle, backed up two steps. \"My apologies. Miss Omura, allow me to introduce
    a friend of mine. This is Katiana Rigomi. She's an Achura investor of some repute.
    Katiana, this is Jaan Omura, the CEO of Caldari Funds Unlimited.\"\n\nThe girl
    thrust out her hand, almost forcefully. The older woman took her hand and shook
    it, and as she did, the girl's expression turned strong and penetrating, full
    of purpose. Her hand was cold.\n\nElsewhere in the room, a camera snapped.\n\n***\n\n__Mercantile
    Club Master Parlor, New Caldari system, The Forge__\n\n__March 29th, YC112__\n\nDim
    lights glowed in far corners, draping tasteful ambience over the plush chamber.
    Against the city\u2019s jagged skyline, two older men were engaged in heated conversation.\n\n\"I
    don't know, Sioras. Advisors to the Federation? It sounds a bit pie-in-the-sky
    to me. You don't think his motives might be spurious in the least?\"\n\n\"No no,
    listen to me,\" said Sioras. \"I'm just saying that if there's anything for us
    to be gained from the hoopla going on right now with Omura and CFU, then it would
    be with him.\"\n\n\"But we'd essentially be turncoats.\"\n\nA note of impatience
    crept into Sioras's voice. \"Think outside the box, Kanai. You and I have been
    doing this for decades. Our best days are behind us. We're basically just glorified
    financial advisors at this point. Sure, we'll work high level, but we won't be
    aiding the enemy. We'll just be economists, there to help bridge the rift between
    the two nations.\"\n\nKanai said nothing. He looked out at the city, watched the
    skylarks ascend into orbit, lingered briefly on the erratic blinking lights of
    the skyscrapers in the fading dusk.\n\n\"Think about it,\" said Sioras. \"The
    political capital would be enormous. I mean, we could get back in the game. The
    Provists have enough internal trouble right now, anyway. They're not going to
    come hunting for us, least of all with the visibility we'll have. And besides,
    we're advisors. It's not like we'll be directly involved in affairs of the state.\"\n\n\"State,\"
    grunted Kanai.\n\nSioras gave a small sigh, clasped his hands together. \"Yeah.
    Look, I know where you're coming from. Don't think I don't. But consider it, at
    least. Give it a fighting chance. Didn't the Sustainability and Co-operation Conference
    do anything to soften your view on this?\"\n\n\"Tell you the truth,\" replied
    Kanai, \"I was smelling deception right from the start of that little get-together.
    The pandering was so obvious. The cultural nods were revolting. You could tell
    they thought they were being subtle, too.\"\n\nSioras nodded. \"Well,\" he said,
    \"our former compatriots have seldom been renowned for their nuance. Whatever
    the case may be in that regard, the facts of the situation speak for themselves,
    don't they?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Kanai. \"I see the opportunity, and it
    seems good. Even if there was blowback from the die-hards, we could probably weather
    it with PR. It's just\u2026I just don't trust that little man. He's unreadable.
    You never know where you have him. Any minute now, I feel like he's going to tap
    me on the shoulder and politely inform me he's the actual father of my children.\"\n\nSioras
    fixed him with an exasperated look, the kind only an old friend can bestow. \"I'm
    going,\" he said presently, with a note of resigned finality. \"So are Kormoken
    and Tikilo, along with a good deal of the Citadel old guard. Are you sure you
    don't want to give it a little more consideration?\"\n\nKanai was silent.\n\n\"Well,\"
    said Sioras. \"You think about it.\"\n\n***\n\n__Caldari Providence Directorate
    Headquarters, Piak system, Lonetrek__\n\n__April 2nd, YC112__\n\n\"It's all over
    the wires, sir. The financial establishment is up in arms.\"\n\nIn the warm interior
    of his personal quarters, Executor Tibus Heth, the highest-ranking man in the
    Caldari State, sat in a posture of frozen rigidity.\n\n\"What's the extent of
    the damage, counsel?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, sir\u2026 for one thing, right now
    Omura's got more on her plate than she can handle. Even if her name clears eventually,
    every one of her close associates will have distanced themselves too far by then
    to come back. And it's making people point fingers elsewhere. High-visibility
    employees are gone from two of the eight megas already. Federation media's playing
    it to the hilt, too. No punches pulled.\"\n\n\"What are the repercussions for
    the CFU pension funds?\" asked Heth, shifting slightly in his seat.\n\n\"Well,
    sir,\" said the counsel, and paused. As if on cue, the holographic field bearing
    his image wavered slightly. \"Net asset values are going to stay more or less
    intact, but if the current situation escalates any further the investors will
    most likely pull their money for political reasons. If enough of them do that,
    we're going to have a problem on our hands that I'm just not sure how we're going
    to deal with.\"\n\n\"And the rest of the megas?\"\n\n\"Lai Dai and Kaalakiota
    are currently engaged in strenuous internal and external PR efforts, trying to
    make sure no one outside the very top tiers of command realizes they could stand
    a real chance of crumbling at the seams due to infighting. Like I said, they're
    really up in arms, sir.\"\n\nFor a moment Heth sat, staring down at his lap and
    rubbing his calloused thumbs together. He stayed that way for a while, with his
    counterpart on the other side of the FTL link growing increasingly uncomfortable.
    Finally, the executor raised his gaze, face resolved, fingers locked in front
    of him.\n\n\"Set up an inquiry. National scale and beyond. I want all figureheads
    closely monitored twenty-four hours a day. I want every single transaction routed
    through our headquarters for analysis. I want nothing to get by us. Nothing, do
    you understand me? We're going to clamp down on this thing hard, and we're going
    to start right now. I trust you know who to talk to for the wheels to be set in
    motion.\"\n\nThere was a small pause at the other end. \"Executor,\" the voice
    came then, \"your wish is my command.\"\n\n***\n\n\"Mister President?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"We
    just received word. Heth ordered a national inquiry. They\u2019re starting with
    the financial institutions. No stone unturned. Being very vocal about it, too.\"\n\n\"Thank
    you.\"\n\n\"Just thought you'd want to know.\" The secretary allowed himself a
    brief grin.\n\nJacus Roden flipped off his viewscreen, drew in a deep breath,
    released it. He leaned back in his seat, thought about the events of days past,
    and tried not to smile himself."
