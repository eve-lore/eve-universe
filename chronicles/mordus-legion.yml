    Caldari State, with its mega-corporations and millions of smaller companies forming
    the fabric of society, hasn\u2019t always posed as a united front as it does today.
    Several times in its history since the State was birthed following its break from
    the Gallente Federation, rival factions and companies have clashed, often with
    deadly intent. Most of the time, the cause of conflict is of an economical nature,
    but every now and then ideology or political differences are the cause.\n\nOne
    of these incidents was the Waschi Uprising, which took place a few decades ago
    in the Kamokor system. Then, a few radical Caldari attacked settlements of Intakis
    in the system and proclaimed that the Caldari State was solely for people of Caldari
    origin. The Caldari authority, as ever fearful that their finely woven social
    tapestry of corporatism would be torn asunder, sent in their best military units
    to quell the uprising before it could spread any further.\n\nThe Waschi Uprising
    did not leave any permanent marks on Caldari society. Still, it did leave one
    legacy that has carried on to this very day and that is Mordu\u2019s Legion.\n\nWhen
    the Caldari broke from the Gallente Federation many Intakis that sympathized with
    their cause were exiled from the Federation. The most militant of those went over
    to the Caldari and asked to join them in their fight against the Federation. These
    were all experienced military personnel and thus very valuable in the early stages
    of the war when veterans were few and far between. The Intakis were all put into
    a separate squadron, with a Caldari officer. His name was Muryia Mordu. Mordu
    was a brilliant young officer and one of the more open-minded Caldari, who generally
    are extremely xenophobic. He immediately took to the Intakis and they to him and
    together they formed one of the more revered fighting units in the Caldari Navy
    during the war with the Federation.\n\nAfter the war ended the Intakis were offered
    cheap land and accommodations in Waschi City on the planet of Kamokor IV. For
    awhile the Intakis lived peacefully, slowly becoming part of the Waschi community.
    Yet the presence of the Intakis caused tension in the city and slowly radicals,
    feeding on the xenophobic tendencies of the Caldari, gained strength. In the end
    the radicals gained majority in the city and began seriously harassing the Intakis.
    When Caldari authorities tried to put an end to this the uprising started in earnest,
    with the radicals and their supporters demanding the exportation of all foreigners
    and the closure of the borders. The Intakis were driven out and, in desperation,
    they called on their old commander Mordu to help them defend themselves and get
    back what was rightfully theirs. Mordu, now retired, agreed to assist. The catch
    was that Mordu and the Intakis were no longer part of the Caldari Navy. Not deterred
    by this small fact, the group formed an independent mercenary corps to fight the
    radicals. This was the inception of Mordu\u2019s Legion.\n\nThe Legion, mostly
    consisting of old veterans from the war with the Federation and young hotheads
    eager for action, helped the Caldari Navy to tear the radicals\u2019 forces to
    pieces under the skillful direction of Mordu. The Caldari authorities were impressed
    by the fighting spirit of the Legion and offered to merge it with the Caldari
    Navy. Mordu and the other leaders of the Legion declined, deciding rather to focus
    on the mercenary nature of the Legion.\n\nIn the years since the uprising Mordu\u2019s
    Legion has grown in stature. Today it is the largest and most famous mercenary
    corps in the world of EVE. The Legion has always had close ties with the Caldari
    State and the two assist each other on many issues. At first the Legion accepted
    only citizens of the Caldari State, but today they accept members from any race,
    as long as they are not known enemies of the Caldari State. Still, the majority
    of the members are of Caldari origin and the leaders are all Caldari. The Legion
    does not train its members, so they are expected to be experienced fighters before
    they apply for membership in the Legion. Members of the Legion get access to high-tech
    Caldari military equipment, even prototype weapons to test out, and are guaranteed
    plenty of employment if they so wish. Non-Caldari that have served in the Legion
    for a long time are offered Caldari citizenship on their retirement.\n\nThe Legion
    is often employed by governments to settle issues that are not directly under
    anyone\u2019s jurisdiction, especially when fast deployment and swift results
    are needed. Their reputation as combat experts as well as fair and honest warriors
    has never been tarnished."
