    not new, but it was made of durable material that would break only under intense
    pressure. This meant that any ridges and bumps on the surface, once the plaster
    had dried out, were generally there to stay. This was particularly notable around
    the holes created for eyes, nose and mouth. The gap in the plaster through which
    he fed had sharp edges, and cuts on his fingers were not uncommon.\n\nWork was
    varied, and depended on the harvest. These narcotics obviously couldn't be grown
    outdoors: with this amount of drugs, satellite photography and even off-world
    lenses might conceivably pick up the fields of plants, spelling the end of the
    entire operation. So it had been taken underground, into massive caves both natural
    and man-made, now serving as greenhouses. The lights, which switched from natural
    to halogen, were the only indicators of day and night. The air was constantly
    humid, and every prisoner without a mask was issued several dry cloths to wipe
    their face. The masked ones did not do this; the plaster was set fast on their
    heads for life, and they learned to live with the constant itch from sweat. Flies
    buzzed around in enormous swarms, settling on practically every surface, but even
    despite the tantalizing drops of sweat that trickled from every masked man, the
    flies kept away from them.\n\nTempting as it might be, the regular workers rarely
    stole any plants for their own use. For most of the flora, serious processing
    was necessary if their active ingredients were to be of any effect at all. You
    could chew leaves and buds all you liked and get nothing for your trouble except
    diarrhea. There did exist the occasional plant which could be eaten or subtly
    smoked for a slight buzz, but it amounted to about as much as a few cups of coffee.
    \n\nOne exception to this was the masked prisoners, most of whom chewed the leaves
    incessantly. They were given far more leeway in doing so, and only punished if
    their pickings dropped noticeably below those of the regular inmates.\n\nThe Gallentean's
    fingers were dry and scarred, partly from the edges on his mask, and partly from
    the razor-sharp leaves and thorns on the plants he'd harvested. Occasionally he
    would put down his picker's basket, raise his hands to the mask and wipe away
    the strands of brown saliva dripping from its mouth hole. He might even lean down
    and expel the chewed leaves from his mouth, looking like a bird regurgitating
    food for its young, only to shove a handful of fresh leaves right back in. Then
    he'd pick up the basket again, and march on. Any time the thorns cut his fingers,
    he would hardly seem to notice.\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\n\"Mind
    if I smoke?\" Gilea said.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Vertan replied.\n\nShe pulled a golden
    case from her purse, flipped it open and selected a long, thin cigarette. Vertan
    noticed how she closed the case and put it back in its proper place before pulling
    out her lighter. \"So,\" she said, puffing out a small cloud of smoke, \"where
    do we go from here?\"\n\n\"You pick a face,\" Vertan said, keying in a sequence
    of digits to his remote control. The wooden panel on his desk slid aside again
    and the holographic projector cast the rotating picture of Gilea's head, but slightly
    smaller this time. On the screen behind him, Gilea's face also grew smaller and
    moved to the side. Beside it, on both the screen and the holograph projector,
    appeared the face of another woman: quite a pretty one, a Caldari, the same race
    and bloodline as Gilea.\n\nVertan handed Gilea the remote. \"Manual browsing.
    Green button scrolls forward, red button back. Press the third blue button from
    the top to see two faces at once, press again for four, eight, sixteen.\"\n\n\"Just
    how many people do you have in there?\" Gilea said.\n\n\"More than enough, believe
    me. Before you can really start picking individual faces, though, you need to
    filter it down for us. The four arrows indicate parts of the face that we've categorized.
    Press the circular black button that's between them, please.\"\n\nShe did. The
    prisoner's nose turned neon yellow.\n\n\"Automated selection. Looks kinda silly,
    but it's worked well so far,\" Vertan said. \"Press the button again, please.
    Thank you.\" The nose returned to its original colour. \"You're choosing the type
    of nose now, so use the left and right arrows to scroll through the types, and
    the up and down arrows to determine size. Press the circular button again to confirm
    your choice, or press the white button near the bottom right corner to cancel
    it. Once you've done this, the yellow light will return again, and you can use
    the arrow buttons to select which other facial part you want to adjust. You with
    me so far?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Gilea said, already enraptured in the remoulding. \"And
    you guarantee that whatever choice I make, you can fulfil it with a real person?\"\n\n\"Yes.
    The choices you get are based on digitized stills of the thousands of prisoners
    we have. We use facial recognition technologies at our bases every day to prevent
    spies. Everyone is scanned when starting work, and when leaving it. If their faces
    have changed noticeably, they are taken aside, checked out, and either eliminated
    or digitized anew. Any selection you make is based on data that was fresh this
    morning. You can have practically anything you like.\"\n\nShe took a fresh drag
    of her cigarette. \"Anything?\" she said.\n\n\"Well, within limits,\" he said.
    \"Obviously the person has to be Caldari, and the same bloodline as you. And the
    same gender. We've occasionally had to explain this to some very unhappy people\"\n\nGilea
    stared at him. \"You've got to be joking,\" she said. \"Who in their right mind
    would even think of doing such a thing?\"\n\nVertan laughed. \"You'd be surprised.
    Anyway, do you have any questions?\"\n\n\"Not really. Except I trust you put the
    prisoners to death afterwards,\" she said.\n\n\"Of course,\" Vertan replied. He
    picked up a cherry-flavoured candy from the bowl. \"No loose ends.\"\n\nShe smiled
    at him. \"No loose ends.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" Vertan said, unwrapping the red sweet
    and popping it into his mouth, \"you couldn't expect anyone to go on living after
    a thing like that.\"\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nThey
    had been working for what seemed like forever. Each cartload of ore hewn from
    the ground was transported to the surface in carts set on rails. About halfway
    up, there was a checkpoint, and machines took care of pulling the carts. Up until
    that point, the carts had to be pushed.\n\nSix men per team. Four to push, two
    to pull, the latter lashed in like cattle. Minmatar were strong, even when imprisoned.
    Especially when imprisoned.\n\n Teams were picked at random, except for the masked
    men. Those worked only with each other; no one else dared get near them. The grunts,
    sighs and curses commonplace elsewhere were absent from their groups. They made
    no sound at all while moving the carts except for the crunch of sand and rock
    under their boots.\n\nThis was one such team. It moved steadily upwards; not fast,
    but it didn't pay to rush the masked prisoners anyway. Occasionally one of them
    would fall to his knees in exhaustion, and roll out of the cart's way as the other
    five picked up his slack for a while. Guards with electric prods traversed the
    tunnels to ensure that no one was out of commission for too long. \n\nOne fell
    now. His teammates increased their efforts without comment, and the masked prisoner
    rolled to the side of the tunnel to breathe. His hands clenched and unclenched,
    clenched and unclenched. The jaw in his metal mask trembled silently on its hinges.\n\nAfter
    a few moments, his hands became very still. He slowly raised his head and looked
    up at the ceiling above him, as if he were seeing it for the first time. Then
    he looked down again, and his hands brushed over the dirt. They dislodged a few
    bits of rock, like miniature replicas of those that lay in his cart. The rocks
    rolled over to him and came to a stop by his feet.\n\nHe looked at those rocks
    for a long time. Had anyone put their ear to his metal jaw, they would have heard
    the faintest whisper of a note, like a scream from the bottom of a well.\n\nHis
    hands picked up one of the rocks and brought them to the jaw, pushed them through.
    There was a swallowing sound. Another rock was picked up, pushed in, swallowed.
    Then another. And another. And another. \n\nBy the time the guards saw him, the
    walls were red with his blood.\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nGilea
    leaned back in her chair, got out another cigarette, lit it and exhaled the smoke
    contentedly.\n\n\"Satisfied?\" Vertan asked.\n\n\"Completely,\" she replied. The
    face of a Caldari girl revolved in front of her. It was quite petite, with a small,
    slightly pouty mouth, high cheekbones, long, thin eyebrows and the one thing Gilea
    wouldn't get from her: Long, beautiful black hair.\" What happens now?\" Gilea
    said, handing Vertan the remote control. \"Do I sign a contract?\"\n\n\"We'll
    take care of that later. Right now, a verbal agreement will do just fine,\" Vertan
    answered with a smile. He keyed in a few numbers on the remote control. \"You're
    absolutely sure this is the face you want?\"\n\nShe returned the smile, and put
    out her cigarette. \"Yes,\" she said.\n\n\"Very good.\" He pressed a small red
    button on the bottom end of the remote. A tiny green light flashed onscreen near
    the Caldari girl's face. Then the images faded, the screens turned themselves
    off, and the lights in the room returned to normal. \"If you'll just step this
    way,\" Vertan said, \"we'll get started.\"\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nThe
    Caldari colony was segregated according to gender. The women sat hunched over
    sewing machines, in complete silence apart from the tak-tak-tak of the tiny steel
    needles. There were rows and rows of them, hundreds of women hunched over their
    work. Guards proceeded slowly along each row, hands resting lazily on inactive
    electrical prods. Rebellions were rare here. They were not part of Caldari nature.
    \n\nIn one row there sat a young, rather pretty girl. Her small mouth pouted in
    tired concentration over the work, and her thin eyebrows arched slightly. Her
    hair, which was black and nearly reached her waist, was neatly combed but rather
    dirty from a long day's work.\n\nA guard walked up and touched her on the elbow.
    She looked up in confusion. The man turned his head to indicate that she should
    get up and walk out. Prisoners were sometimes taken into solitary rooms, for any
    number of reasons: Special commission work, extra rest, checkup of their digital
    portraits.\n\nThe girl obeyed. Silently, she got up and, head bowed, walked out
    of the massive room. The guard followed. Once they had exited, entering a small
    steel corridor, he took the lead. She was marched through a veritable labyrinth
    of corridors, each one exactly like the last. They went on for so long that she
    had begun to suspect they would simply come back to the sewing room, but at last
    the guard stopped in front of a steel door. A lens beside it scanned his face,
    and the door opened. They stepped in, the door closed, and the girl felt a sinking
    feeling in her stomach, as if she were being pulled downwards.\n\nA minute later,
    the door opened again. To sunlight.\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nThe
    last thing Gilea saw was a blinding flash of light.\n\nHer unconscious body, strapped
    and secured on a gurney, was placed in a special container inside the frigate.
    Moments later the ship undocked, accompanied by a guarding force, and sped off
    towards the company's research facilities.\n\nOnce there, Gilea was unshipped
    and placed on an operating table. Vertan had explained that while it wasn't strictly
    necessary to put her under while still in company headquarters, experience had
    shown it to be by far the best option. She would remain completely unaware of
    the laboratory's exact location, which was a good thing for both her and the company,
    and there would be no risk of nerves and second thoughts during the trip.\n\nThe
    operation itself went without a hitch. The machines severed her face and placed
    it in a special sterile container. As they moved on to the subcutaneous remoulding
    necessary so that her new one would fit, one of the scientists took the container
    and headed towards the vaults. Amongst themselves it was called the Gallery of
    Faces, a large room with one wall completely white and ice cold to the touch.
    The scientist entered the room while another monitored inside a control room on
    the other side of a pane of glass. A drawer in the wall slid out and the scientist
    in the room slotted the container into it with a click. The drawer slid back,
    there was a sound like the dropping of ice cubes into warm water, and the scientist
    behind the glass gave a silent thumbs-up. Gilea's face had now been flash-frozen,
    ready for use if she ever needed it back.\n\nElsewhere in that same laboratory,
    another scientist entered another surgery room. In his pocket he carried a white
    mask.\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nIn this
    room there is no sound, not even the tak-tak-tak of the sewing machines. The women
    are too tired to talk, and most lie motionless on their beds, trying not to hope.\n\nThe
    colony is not only separated by gender. The masked women have separate beds at
    the back of the room.\n\nOne of them adjusts her mask slightly, her arms bruised
    from the electric prods. Her long, black hair is held in place by a cheap elastic.
    It had kept falling in front of her eyes, and she had kept pushing it back, until
    she started pulling at it. She had torn out several handfuls before the guards
    got to her. \n\nThe girl stares dully at the floor for a long time, her mask showing
    the same beautiful, expressionless face as everyone else in the room. Then she
    crosses her arms and, hugging herself tight, lays down to sleep.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;line-height:172.5%;font-style:italic;margin:
