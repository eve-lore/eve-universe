    have watched these monsters come for us three times now.\n\nFor three mornings
    in a row these beasts have descended upon our district bringing fire and death.
    Thousands of us have died already. Our sorrow threatens to overwhelm the will
    to resist. How can we fight for our families in the face of such hopelessness?\n\nThey
    kill indiscriminately, the damage inflicted upon us as much psychological as it
    is physical. After a few minutes, when we begin to close in on one of them, he
    runs like the most worthless of cowards. Each time we have killed one in pursuit,
    and yet each time more return the following morning. We still do not know how
    many there are. The villagers are panicked and confused by each assault and offer
    unclear, contradictory accounts of the attack. Some have reported as many as five
    men, others have said they\u2019ve only ever seen one at a time.\n\nIt is almost
    as if they goad us with these deaths, as if they allow us our retribution only
    to spite us, because when they reappear the next morning, we are all reminded
    of just how futile our resistance is. Right before more of us are culled like
    diseased cattle.\n\nOur children, their mothers, everyone has become a target.
    Yesterday they appeared in the school district. We lost nearly two hundred of
    them before anyone realized something was horribly wrong. Over eight hundred dead
    children: That was the final cost before one of them was taken down. The rest
    must have fled afterwards, like they always did.\n\nI cannot see any greater purpose
    to these murderous rampages. I cannot see any reason, no matter how sinister,
    in their lust for death. I only feel the fear and despair that they have planted
    in our hearts. I wonder if that is why they have come here. I wonder if revenge
    is what brings these monsters out here to the deserts and dust, far from anywhere
    of significance.\n\nOur lives are ones of quiet worship lived in service to God
    alone. We serve no other purpose here, and so their presence among us is as revealing
    as it is terrifying. The villagers have spoken of the ones we have killed. They
    are Minmatar. They are brothers, even. It suggests, in dark whispers to our souls,
    that these men have come for their own reasons.\n\nThree times we have sent these
    demons back to hell, and three times they have returned. Today will be no different.
    Today we will sit and wait as more suffering is visited upon us, God\u2019s chosen.
    There will be no school and no markets in the square. Today there will be only
    Church. Here we will sit and with heads bowed, humbly asking of God, what can
    drive a man to such things?\n\nAs the sirens of border defense systems are tripped
    for the fourth time, I fear we will get our answer. I fear God will tell us what
    we already know in our hearts. These are not men: They are the Beast.\n\n---\n\n<p
