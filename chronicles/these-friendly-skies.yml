    Friendly Skies__\nby Maxim Peltast\n\n*(This article originally appeared in the
    Federation Marquee\u2019s Culture section as part of the Mad World column series,
    August 17, YC 114. Reproduced with permission.)*\n\nI\u2019ve been waiting here
    a long time. There\u2019s a gigantic silver dome above me. It\u2019s interesting
    enough to look at\u2014platinum waves of electric light crisscrossing over a spiral
    window pattern inlaid in the silver\u2014but after an hour and a half, my patience
    is starting to wear thin.\n\nI am sitting in a sunken portion of this cavernous
    room, enveloped in a gigantic couch. In front of me is a large glassplated drink
    table carved out of choice sabarinth, with tasteful outcroppings sprouting from
    its four corners in a carefully organic fashion. On my right, past the floor-to-ceiling
    windows which lead to the outside, a crowd of vaguely famous young people\u2014holostars,
    models\u2014thrash around in a narrow beach alcove bordered on the opposite side
    by a sheer cliff. The muted lighting lends a surreal green glow to the cliff stone
    and the sand on the beach, casting the revelers into sharp relief with the black
    sea and sky beyond.\n\nI decide I need another drink. I wrestle myself from the
    couch, jog up the steps leading to the main floor of the chamber and make my way
    over to an embarrassingly wellstocked bar that takes up a whole corner of the
    room. As I approach it, one of the guards steps in front of me. \u201CSorry, Mr.
    Peltast,\u201D he says. \u201CNo more drinks until Mr. Voras arrives.\u201D\n\nI
    am shocked and bewildered. \u201CWhat?\u201D I say.\n\n\u201CNo more drinks, Mr.
    Peltast. Mr. Voras has instructed us to restrict you to a three-drink maximum
    until he\u2019s personally present.\u201D\n\n\u201CMaximum,\u201D I say to him
    and pull a cigarette from my case. \u201CFunny story. Do you know how I got my
    name?\u201D\n\n\\***\n\nI kind of like doing interviews with a broken nose, anyway.
    Keeps you alert. They jacked me up on ultrafancy local and plopped me back down
    on that couch. Plugged me up pretty good, too. I suppose bleeding on a couch like
    this would be something of a faux pas and they would rather save me the embarrassment.\n\nThe
    guards have given me an extra drink. As I start to ponder whether it was their
    own initiative or whether the capsuleer planned for this all along, the man himself
    enters. He takes a couple of steps into the room, makes a cursory scan of the
    surroundings, then nods to his men and heads straight for where I\u2019m sitting.\n\nHis
    hand feels like powdered rubber and his grip is pistonlike. Sickly smooth, soft,
    precisely measured. He\u2019s a full four inches taller than me. Freckled grayish-dark
    skin, long braided hair held back with a lizard fang cross, a gleaming white grin
    way too perfect to be real.\n\n\u201CMr. Peltast, a pleasure to finally meet you,\u201D
    he says in a warm baritone.\n\n\u201CMr. Voras,\u201D I say. I let go of his hand
    and plant myself on the couch again. While he sits down I take out my recorder
    and set it on the sabarinth showpiece. It\u2019s an outdated piece of equipment,
    but I\u2019d rather not use the subderm this time. I want this guy to be fully
    aware he\u2019s being recorded.\n\nI\u2019m sure your time is as valuable as mine,\u201D
    he says. \u201CWhy don\u2019t we get started?\u201D\n\nIf he even notices my smashed
    nose, he\u2019s not showing it.\n\n\\***\n\nI decided long before I got here that
    relentless straight shooting would be the best strategy. When dealing with someone
    this accustomed to calculating every move, the only way to catch them off guard
    is to throw a flurry and hope you find a weak spot.\n\n\u201CSo, tell me how you
    feel about death,\u201D I say.\n\nHe smiles with a mildness that surprises me.
    He leans forward slightly with his elbows on his knees, rubs his fingertips together
    for a brief while.\n\n\u201CWell,\u201D he says, \u201Cin my line of work, it
    is a filthy necessity. It sits on your shoulder, it surrounds you in your capsule.
    You go through it several times. Gradually you come to terms with it, just as
    the bricklayer comes to terms with lung disease, and the journalist reconciles
    himself with half-truths and ambiguities.\u201D The mildness in his smile has
    turned to wryness.\n\n\u201CWhat about the people under your command?\u201D I
    ask him. \u201CDo you find a need to reconcile yourself with their deaths?\u201D\n\nHe
    looks down at the table and for a moment he\u2019s silent, then he says, \u201CNone
    of those people were unaware of what they signed up for. They know there are risks,
    same as with any other profession. Sure, the primary goal of my alliance is making
    money and expanding our influence, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t care
    about the people in our employ. Our agencies send out personal letters of condolence
    to the families of every single person who dies on one of our ships. We provide
    insurance payouts to next of kin for all ship personnel.\u201D\n\nHe\u2019s looking
    me straight in the eye. The composure is absolute. I decide to shift gears slightly
    and pursue another avenue. I ask him what types of ships he generally pilots.
    \n\n\u201CAnything short of a capital ship,\u201D he says. \u201CBattleships for
    large engagements, HACs and recons for smaller skirmishes. I like to grab an inty
    or a covert ops and do some tackling or scouting every once in a while. I\u2019m
    not part of the command structure, so my role is rather fluid. I like it that
    way.\u201D\n\n\u201CFor the benefit of the readership,\u201D I say. \u201CHacks?
    Inty?\u201D\n\n\u201CMy apologies,\u201D he says, with practiced grace. \u201CCommon
    shorthand in the business. \u2018HAC\u2019 is an acronym, stands for heavy assault
    cruiser. \u2018Inty\u2019 is short for interceptor.\u201D I detect only the slightest
    trace of smugness in his smile.\n\n\u201CSo when one of your ships blows up, how
    many people would you say die on average?\u201D I ask.\n\n\u201CAnywhere from
    three to three hundred, depending on the ship I\u2019m piloting,\u201D he says.
    \u201CGallente ships are a slight obsession of mine, so my crew complements tend
    to be smaller than those of the guys who fly other tech. The Gallente have a great
    love of automation.\u201D\n\n\u201CBetter for machines to do our killing than
    for us to have to do it,\u201D I say. I don\u2019t say this for political reasons;
    I simply happen to concur on this particular point.\n\nFor a few moments he looks
    at me with a completely unreadable expression. \u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D
    he says. \u201CTo tell you the truth, I stopped thinking about it a long time
    ago.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhy\u2019s that?\u201D I ask.\n\n\u201CWell,\u201D he says,
    \u201CI learned early on in this game that if you let those kinds of things gnaw
    away at you, they\u2019re just going to keep gnawing away at you forever. And
    in my line of work, forever can be quite a long time.\u201D\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s
    interesting that you call it \u2018the game,\u2019 \u201D I say. I briefly outline
    a theory that\u2019s been making its way through the Gallente psychological establishment
    recently, which posits that a capsuleer\u2019s life resembles nothing more than
    a game, and that the Jove may have given us the capsule for the sole reason that
    they wanted to use us as a test bed for the Jovian disease; that, just maybe,
    the disease is essentially extreme ennui at the fact that death means nothing
    anymore. When you exist largely on a field devoid of connection to the rest of
    the universe, you start to withdraw from it all. Or so it goes.\n\nHe chuckles,
    but there\u2019s little humor behind the sound. \u201CWe keep hearing that,\u201D
    he says. \u201CBut what are we supposed to think? I mean, here I am. I\u2019ve
    gone through all this training and modification. I can operate marvels of engineering
    with little more than my thoughts, and under the right circumstances I can cheat
    death. All this, just so an unfortunate race of genetic mutants can use me as
    a test bed?\u201D He shakes his head and smiles. \u201CIt\u2019s flatly ridiculous.
    They are a technologically advanced people. I\u2019m perfectly sure they have
    ways of testing their subjects that don\u2019t involve giving up fundamental tech
    knowledge.\u201D\n\nHe pauses for a while, then says, \u201CYou know what? Even
    if the whole thing were true, I\u2019d rather be a capsule pilot fighting for
    an alliance than a construction worker building a church.\u201D\n\n\\***\n\nI
    ask him if he ever does think of it as a game.\n\n\u201CThe more you\u2019re in
    it,\u201D he says, \u201Cyeah, the more it does start to seem like that. I mean,
    it gets knocked into your head from the moment you get past prescreening, and
    the veterans never tire of reminding you: casualties are casualties, and you are
    having actual casualties. Fleshand- blood people, gone forever. But it doesn\u2019t
    really hit home until you get popped for the first time. The first time it happens
    for real, in the heat of combat\u2014the first time you actually lose something,
    whether it\u2019s crew or money or pride or alliance assets\u2014you realize a
    couple of things.\u201D \n\nHe pauses here, rubs his forehead pensively for a
    brief while. \u201COne of them is that loss is an inevitable fact of this whole
    messy business, and the other is that you yourself are going to be around for
    a while. Let the negative aspects infest your head for long enough, and no brain
    scan or clone jump is ever going to save you.\u201D\n\n\u201CSo essentially,\u201D
    I say, \u201Cyou learn to not care about the people that have to die because you\u2019re
    furthering the aims of your corporate overlords.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat I\u2019m
    saying, Mr. Peltast,\u201D he replies, not skipping a beat, \u201Cis that these
    independent adventure seekers, having been informed of the risks, willingly take
    their lives into their own hands when they sign up for crew duty. They are amply
    compensated, make no mistake. More importantly, they know they\u2019re playing
    their part in something that is bigger than they are. As am I. As are you.\u201D\n\n\u201C
    \u2018Having been informed of the risks,\u2019 \u201D I say. \u201CBy which you
    mean, \u2018having been deceivingly enticed by promises of incredible exploits
    and a better life in deep space, when really they receive nothing but a dirty
    cot in cramped quarters and a socket wrench to turn five times a day.\u2019 \u201D\n\nHe
    stares at me levelly for a few seconds, then very calmly asks me to go on to the
    next question.\n\n\\***\n\n\u201CSo tell me about this get-together you\u2019re
    hosting right now,\u201D I say. \u201CHolostars and local dignitaries, I bet.\u201D\n\n\u201CSomething
    like that,\u201D he says.\n\n\u201CHow do you decide who gets to come to one of
    your parties?\u201D I ask. \u201CQuite an exclusive list, I\u2019d imagine.\u201D\n\n\u201CNot
    really. You just have to be acquainted with me or with someone I know, and be
    within traveling distance. Travel is really the deciding factor. This little getaway
    of mine is a fair distance from the nearest populated planet, so whoever can arrive
    in time gets to come. Simple as that.\u201D\n\n\u201CSo whoever comes and however
    powerful they are is a measure of your stature,\u201D I say. \u201CI\u2019ve heard
    of this before. You call it \u2018yacht wrangling.\u2019 \u201D\n\nHis smile tightens.
    Crow\u2019s-feet appear at the corners of his eyes.\n\n\u201CKeeps your high-society
    contacts on their toes,\u201D I continue. \u201CZip off to some locale on an errand,
    throw an impromptu soir\xE9e that evening just to see who can make it. Instant
    leverage over everyone who arrives, since the mere fact they\u2019re here means
    they\u2019re dying to get in good with you.\u201D\n\n\u201CWell, now,\u201D he
    says and clears his throat. The sound is crisp and snappy. \u201CI see you\u2019ve
    read up.\u201D\n\nNot just a pretty face, egger.\n\n\u201CApproximately half the
    people here are agents of various corporations, and approximately half are representatives
    of various interests\u2014social, political, or religious,\u201D he says. \u201CI
    prefer to view it this way: whoever arrives here has shown a willingness to enter
    into a dialogue with me on making things happen, down on the planets, on the stations.
    In the real world, away from the blunted abstractions of my customary arena. True,
    it does tickle that they come all this way to see me, but don\u2019t make the
    mistake of thinking my motives purely mercenary, or my parties purely frivolous.\u201D\n\nBefore
    I can counter, he gestures for his men to fix me another drink. \u201COn that
    subject, I seem to have an archdeacon to attend to,\u201D he says. \u201CJust
    a few minutes. Make yourself at home.\u201D\n\nWhile he\u2019s away I sip my horrendously
    stiff bloodclaw and ponder the racial dynamics of the situation. Over the next
    minute, my subsequent line of questioning becomes apparent to me. By the time
    he returns, my glass is sitting empty on his million-ISK table.\n\n\u201CSo, Mr.
    Peltast,\u201D he says and takes his seat again, smooth and unruffled. \u201CLet\u2019s
    continue on with it.\u201D \n\n\u201CAll right,\u201D I say. \u201CYou yourself
    are Brutor Minmatar, correct?\u201D\n\n\u201CVery astute of you,\u201D he says.
    \u201CI would have thought the fang cross a bit of a giveaway.\u201D\n\n\u201CAnd
    this planet we\u2019re sitting on is located in the heart of Amarrian space, correct?\u201D\n\nHe
    nods, his expression neutral.\n\n\u201CAnd most of the people attending your party
    right now are Amarr.\u201D\n\n\u201CYes, Mr. Peltast. Does this surprise you terribly?\u201D\n\n\u201CWell,
    I guess the obvious thing for me to say right now would be that given the current
    state of relations between the two nations, it would seem odd that your country
    would allow someone of your influence to associate with the enemy, and furthermore
    to curry social\u2014\u201D\n\n\u201CMr. Peltast,\u201D he says, standing and
    striding heavily up the steps to the main floor. \u201CAre you seriously pretending
    to be so naive as to think the nation-state still means anything in our current
    climate?\u201D He walks over to the nearest wall and gestures at an artifact replica
    hanging there. \u201CDo you know what this is?\u201D\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s a khumaak,\u201D
    I reply.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s a replica of a khumaak,\u201D he says. \u201CA real
    one would cause legal problems for me in this part of the universe. Do you know
    why I keep it there?\u201D he asks.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not to
    remind yourself of your beleaguered brothers and sisters,\u201D I say.\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re
    perfectly correct,\u201D he replies. \u201CI keep it there to remind myself that
    national symbols are a folly of the past.\u201D He steps back down to the sunken
    area and plants himself on the edge of my couch. \u201CThe race of a capsuleer,
    Mr. Peltast,\u201D he says, leaning forward and staring at me with curiously flat
    eyes, \u201Cis as insignificant to the world of politicos, power brokers, and
    social climbers as his hair color or his sexual habits. I have not aligned myself
    with the republic or its aims for a good few years now, for the simple reason
    that I came upon my alliance, and in them I found a better fit for my outlook
    and preferred methods than anything I\u2019d encountered before. The nation-state
    is fast becoming an irrelevant entity in the face of the new order, anyway.\u201D\n\n\u201CThe
    new order being what?\u201D I ask.\n\n\u201CYou know this as well as I do, Mr.
    Peltast,\u201D he says, standing up and circling back around to his earlier spot
    on the couch. \u201CI\u2019ve read your columns. I know where you\u2019re coming
    from. Please don\u2019t insult me by assuming I don\u2019t have cadres of analysts
    working to harvest what substance still exists on the withered vine of popular
    culture.\u201D As he sits down, he gestures for one of his men to get him a drink.
    I privately note that it\u2019s his first since I got here.\n\n\u201CSo what\u2019s
    in it for you?\u201D I ask. \u201CKnowing the anguish you\u2019re causing to millions
    of people the world over every single month, knowing the cascade of consequences
    you set in motion every day, while continuing to belong to a privileged class
    . . . what keeps you going? Why continue as you are?\u201D\n\nHis freshly mixed
    drink now in hand, he genuinely appears to ponder this for a moment.\n\n\u201CDo
    you know that thing, when you\u2019re just falling asleep, and you\u2019re sort
    of drifting off into unconsciousness, and suddenly you feel like you\u2019re falling
    and you\u2019re jerked headfirst back into reality? That\u2019s what it feels
    like to die, only the oscillation is orders of magnitude more pronounced. And
    the mind never learns that you\u2019re actually coming back. The mind just dutifully
    replays your whole life before you, every single time. I mean, it only takes a
    second every time, but that second gets expanded to infinity.\u201D\n\nHe stares
    into his glass and gives it a gentle shake. There is a small tinkling of ice.
    \u201CI can tell you,\u201D he says, \u201CI\u2019ve been through my life just
    shy of thirty times, and . . .\u201D He looks up, points that hollow glare right
    at me. \u201CI don\u2019t see any pattern,\u201D he says. \u201CIt\u2019s all
    just there. It\u2019s a random dance of interlocking phenomena, a battle fought
    between two sides just because they can. In time, you reconcile yourself to the
    fact that this is what it is, that you\u2019re likely in it for the long haul,
    and that you might as well enjoy being part of the equation.\u201D He stares at
    me, his gaze level, lips closed, and jaw relaxed.\n\nAnd here it is, the thing
    that\u2019s bugged me throughout the whole scenario. I\u2019m searching for the
    fake, the angle in the man\u2019s words, and I\u2019m just not finding it. You
    would think someone of his stature would have hordes of publicity staff clamoring
    to program his every word when he makes an official press appearance, but beyond
    the thuggish guards (whose degenerate simian faces you can expect to find on sex
    offender lists all over the federation in the near future), there hasn\u2019t
    been anyone present at any point during this interview, beyond just me and him.
    And right now he\u2019s looking at me with that perfectly straight goddamn face.\n\nWith
    a creeping horror, it begins to occur to me: he is able to reveal himself here,
    no strings attached. Right now, his only game is simply to have no game, because
    most of you\u2014our beloved readership\u2014don\u2019t really care, and the small
    minority of you who do are too goddamned puny and ineffectual to do anything about
    it. He can safely reveal himself, because we are so many rungs below him on the
    social ladder that it is merely a case of the sun preaching its timeless gospel
    to the space dust.\n\nAnd these particular stars are multiplying, children.\n\nWait,
    you thought the world was screwed up already?\n\nYou ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\n\n\u2014
    Maxim Peltast\n\n*(Author\u2019s postscript: After making his speech, Mr. Voras
    excused himself, shook my hand, thanked me for the interview, and left his untouched
    drink on his table.)*"
