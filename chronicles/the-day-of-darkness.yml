    The Day of Darkness was properly named. That day saw one of the worst storms ever
    on the biggest continent on Matar, laying incredible amount of destruction in
    few short hours. But greater danger loomed, because that same day six giant slave
    vessels entered the Pator system. From there each ship set out for a different
    Minmatar planet, escorted by heavily armed military ships. Once in orbit the Amarrians
    descended onto the surface and started rounding up people.


    The Minmatars put up a brave resistance, but to no avail, the superior Amarr technology
    swept all Minmatar armed forces away, then plundered the populace at will. In
    addition, the Amarrians took great care of destroying every Minmatar space ship
    and installation they encountered, with the intent of making it very difficult
    for the Minmatars to gain strong space presence.


    The Amarrians enslaved hundreds of millions of Minmatar in that first raid. Over
    the next millennium they would repeat their slave raids with regularity, capturing
    hundreds of millions more and throwing the Minmatar nation into a state of confusion,
    sorrow and insecurity.
