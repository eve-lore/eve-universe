    his laboratory late this morning, like most mornings. Even though he had slept
    throughout the night, he felt tired. Dwarfed by the surrounding machinery, he
    threaded his way between old propulsion system prototypes meant for assault frigates,
    research that had been very promising three years ago but had come to no fruition,
    leaving him pretty much alone in what now felt like a tomb rather than a bustling
    laboratory. His work had seen no credible result, and he now faced an ever-growing
    black hole of debt he saw no chance of ever paying back.\n\n\"It's not that you're
    selfish,\" his wife said, during his lunch break holocall down to the planet surface.
    Kia hated life in orbit, and hardly ever came up to the research station. Aki
    would take the dropship down at the end of every month to spend time with her
    and their only son, Rias.\n\n\"But it's always been about that big breakthrough,\"
    she continued, launching into a monologue he knew almost verbatim by now. \"How
    many years did you spend at that engineering university? Sometimes I think you
    tried to take every possible class and degree there is, no matter how long it
    took,\" she added in a light tone. \n\nAki's mind started to drift. He found himself
    thinking of hyperbolic differential equations, how he'd never fully been able
    to apply them to spatial microdistortion. It was a problem that could revolutionize
    propulsion if solved. Despite the continued lack of progress he felt so close
    to the answer, as close as he had felt two years ago. But still, he'd been just
    as close two years ago. She *was* right; he'd gone to a great number of different
    courses on different topics, believing it would give him a bird's-eye perspective
    that more specialized scientists lacked. Still, as time went by, that view had
    become increasingly cloudy. *I just have to focus better*, he told himself.\n\n\"You're
    not speaking,\" she said, breaking his train of thought.\n\n\"Sorry, my mind was
    elsewhere.\"\n\nShe was silent for a moment. \"Why don't you come down planetside
    and we'll talk. Take a break. Come home.\"\n\nAki glanced around the unmanned
    research lab. \"My work has to go on,\" he muttered.\n\n\"Come down. I'll see
    you tomorrow.\" She disconnected.\n\nHe knew what this was about. She was going
    to persuade him to give up. To abandon his research, to take an associate professor
    position at the local military college and teach math to people who had no respect
    for it and no sense of its beauty. Grunts that simply needed the certification
    so they could be issued a weapon and shipped off to some remote hellhole world
    to die. He suspected that deep down, his wife resented his intellect and feared
    the moment he would make his discovery, since that would prove her wrong after
    years of criticsm and sullen disappointment.\n\nA college professor? He used to
    have college professors as fans. When he'd still been a student, his early research
    had been some of the most promising new applied astromechanical science in the
    Federation. When he'd finally graduated, a bidding war had been waged between
    the largest engineering and aerospatial corporations, fighting to snatch that
    supertalent and place their research and development divisions securely at the
    forefront of discovery. \n\nWhen he'd been hired by Duvolle Laboratories he'd
    felt as if his life was copied straight out of a holoreel: mixing with the most
    brilliant minds of his time, granted access to the kind of highly classified research
    and technology he'd only theorized about while at school. But somehow, after all
    those years spent preparing for the breakthrough moment \u2013 all the hopes,
    the late nights \u2013 it never came. Like being suddenly mute in a dream and
    trying to communicate with people. \n\nIt became harder and harder for him to
    come up with anything worthwhile. The corporation was patient with him at first,
    providing tutors and all manner of assistance. Human resources even offered illegal
    neurological boosters. Nothing. After they cancelled his contract, news got out
    about his inability to innovate, so he had no other choice but to go it alone.
    \n\nHe'd taken out a massive loan and funded his research himself. That had been
    three years ago.\n\nHe sighed. Something inside him began to give. He'd never
    allowed himself to think it before, but it had been getting harder and harder
    to resist, and at this moment the dam finally broke. \n\nShe is right. This is
    going nowhere. Perhaps I'm not the greatest mind in the Federation. Perhaps I
    have to accept the fact that future textbooks will not have a chapter on my discoveries,
    where students will have to learn about my great dark era before I struck gold.
    *Perhaps that's never going to happen*. Secretly, he had believed all these things.
    He had been waiting for that invitation from the President to celebrate his discovery.
    His honorary titles. His endless pile of money. His well-earned prize.\nPerhaps
    it would never come.\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nThe
    dropship shook violently as they crossed into the atmosphere. In addition to being
    cramped, Economy class lacked the gyrosmoothing equipment of the more expensive
    classes. *They make you feel every nasty twist and rumble, just to incentivize
    you to pay for upper class*, he thought. *Like space travel isn't uncomfortable
    enough*.\n\nKia was at the spaceport to greet him. She had brought Rias as well,
    which was unusual since he should have been at school. Though he was almost ten
    years old, Rias looked older. Kia seemed strangely happy, considering Aki hadn't
    even told her he was giving up and shutting down the lab. She chatted the whole
    way home; about nothing, it seemed to him. *Something is not right*, he thought.\n\nTheir
    apartment at sublevel 34 felt damp and dirty. The air belowground was thick and
    had an industrial smell to it. Aki had promised Kia that when his research paid
    off they'd have a nice place aboveground, one with actual windows instead of the
    oversaturated holoframes that now adorned their small apartment. Years later,
    they still lived in what she referred to as \"the hole.\"\n\nThe loud fan noise
    and cold light didn't seem to annoy her that much today, though. Shortly after
    they'd arrived home and Aki had begun to unpack, she got straight to the point.\n\n\"Honey,
    do you remember Avagher Xarasier? I ran into him while taking Rias to the science
    museum last week.\"\n\nAki paused. Avagher. His old classmate. \"Yes, he-\" He
    cleared his throat. \"Wasn't he with CreoDron?\"\n\n\"Not anymore,\" said Kia,
    an note of excitement coming into her voice. \"He's with Duvolle now. Doing *great*.\"\n\n\"Oh?
    That's good for him.\"\n\n\"Well, not just for him. I spoke to him about your
    situation. He was asking about you, you know. About how promising your research
    had been. He talked about how he idolized you back then.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"They
    have a new program. Something that might help us. It's pretty radical. He wants
    to meet and talk about it.\"\n\nShe handed him a small card with the words *DUVOLLE
    LABORATORIES* glowing dimly off the polished plastic. From beside the logo, Avagher's
    perfectly groomed face grinned up at him. It hadn't changed much from the last
    time he'd seen him. Aki looked up at Kia, who was smiling at him, then down at
    their son, who was playing by the side of the bed.\n\n\"Is it a job?\" he asked
    her. \"I don't know. It... it would be strange working for him.\"\n\n\"I don't
    know that much about it,\" she replied. \"It's something new, something they can't
    talk about to people outside the company. Something that will change the world,
    he said.\"\n\n*Change the world*. How often Aki had heard that phrase. *Sure*.
    *Let's change the world*, he thought.\n\n\"I'll go see him tomorrow,\" he said.
    \"But for now I'd just really like to spend the rest of the day with you two.
    Maybe go to the museum?\" Aki felt he should use the time to vitalize his son's
    mind, to light his way down the path of math and science just like he himself
    had been inspired at that tender age.\n\n\"We were just at the museum last week,
    you know,\" she said. \"That's where we met Avagher.\"\n\n\"Oh. Right. Well, perhaps
    I'll just do some work, then.\"\n\nRetreating into his small office, Aki began
    hammering at his terminal. He brought up the schematics for the propulsion prototype,
    more out of habit than curiosity. He'd gone over them hundreds if not thousands
    of times in the past months, simply spinning the articulated rendering of the
    model, reviewing the controller code, not really changing anything, not learning
    anything new, but it made him feel busy \u2013 and, more importantly, made him
    *look* busy. Kia shut the door, blocking the sound from outside, leaving Aki alone
    in the monotonous hum of the industrial air conditioning unit servicing his little
    room, on sublevel 34, in the city of Rumas on the planet Fricoure V.\n\n<div align=\"center\"
    style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nAvagher Xarasier welcomed Aki into his
    office. His face was still perfectly groomed, his skin seemed artificially void
    of any discontinuities and his hand felt soft as Aki grabbed it. \"Sorry to keep
    you waiting. Things have been going at tachyon speed for the past few weeks.\"
    He grinned the same radiating smirk that had been so prominently displayed on
    his card. \"With all of this magnificent stuff coming out of W-space, we're having
    problems keeping up.\" As he regarded Aki, a beneficent warmth came into his eyes.
    Aki suppressed a shudder.\n\n\"Wormhole space?\" Aki asked. He knew that capsuleers
    had been going in there for a while now, scavenging old parts from the derelict
    space stations of ancient races, but to the best of his knowledge nothing new
    had emerged from those areas for a while. \"You have to excuse me. I haven't been
    in the loop. My contract with Duvolle expired some time ago and I don't have clearance...\"\n\n\"You
    haven't heard!?\" Avagher seemed very excited, more than his usual self. Suddenly
    he paused. \"You did sign the non-disclosure contract, didn't you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,
    on my way in,\" replied Aki. \"A number of contracts, actually. I've probably
    signed away access rights to my body and worldly belongings. Lot of fine print.\"\n\n\"Okay,
    we're good then!\" continued Avagher. \"You see, they found something inside these
    old Talocan wrecks. We thought we'd seen it all, but up until now they'd only
    send droids in there. \n\nThese are pretty nasty places! They're still powered,
    and parts of them have so much radiation and static that the droids simply get
    toasted. People assumed they weren't that interesting, just black spots of radiation
    that they learned to avoid.\"\n\n\"But recently, some explorers started to go
    in there. Death wish, if you ask me, but they actually found something remarkable.
    Technology aeons beyond anything we've seen. It's not Jovian, but I'll wager it's
    close. It seems as if this race was able to fold space and construct some type
    of quantum computer within the folds. Our lab has been working 24/7 to reverse-engineer
    the samples we've managed to purchase off these salvagers who've been returning
    from W-space.\" He waited, watching Aki intently.\n\n\"You want me to take a look
    at this new technology?\" Aki was elated. This was what he'd always dreamed of.
    Getting a taste of the future, being part of taking the world into it.\n\n\"Not
    quite,\" said Avagher. \"No, we have a great exospatial team working on that right
    now. Used to be our theory team, but overnight they became an applied science
    team. Imagine that!\"\n\nAki was silent for a few seconds, breathing measuredly.
    \"So what is it you want me to do? Why did you bring me in?\"\n\nAvagher looked
    out the window a moment, watching as the cold blue sun of Fricoure set behind
    the sprawling cityscape. Presently he turned to Aki, looked at him with a graver
    expression than before, and began speaking.\n\n\"Do you ever worry that you will
    never be able to make the most of your mind? That you will never have that breakthrough,
    that moment of brilliance when your decades of education and experimentation converge
    in one perfect singularity and out comes an idea so powerful that it will shine
    a light on your name for decades to come?\"\n\nAki was taken aback. \"Well,\"
    he said, then hesitated. \"I am still early in my research...\"\n\n\"Actually,
    no,\" said Avagher, \"you are quite late. Most brilliant ideas and inventions
    are made when people are in their twenties or early thirties. Of all the great
    mathematical discoveries of our time, can you name even one which was discovered
    by someone older than thirty?\"\n\n\"I'm thirty-five,\" said Aki. \"I still have
    a large backlog of experiments and research planned, based on my early theories.
    I think you can't just dismiss anyone over thirty as useless to science.\"\n\n\"That's
    not my point!\" Avagher approached Aki and placed a hand on his shoulder. \"This
    is not about being a good college professor, writing witty essays, finding minor
    inconsistencies in someone else's research or publishing papers no-one cares about.
    Sure, you can live to the age of ninety and still be called a scientist, but that's
    not really what a true scientist is after. \n\n\"No, what any man or woman committed
    to science is truly after is that perfect crystalline moment of discovery. That
    moment of bliss when it all becomes clear to you. The moment that makes you immortal
    in science. Everything else is just hubris, and therefore irrelevant.\"\n\nAki
    felt this was going nowhere. \"Why did you bring me here? To tell me I'm never
    going to get anywhere and that I spent too much time in school? To be honest,
    I can get that information somewhere else.\"\n\n\"No, Aki, I want to give you
    the opportunity to have this happen to you. Not in some distant and nebulous future,
    but here and now. We have something, Aki. It's something that came out of those
    excursions, and it's something that can make this happen in less than an hour.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!
    All knowledge accrued over a lifetime, boiled together, connected and yielding
    results in an hour? That's impossible.\"\n\n\"Not quite. Now, you have to understand,
    Aki, this is not something we have piled up in cargo containers in some hangar.
    We've only come across a few nanograms of the IN-06 substance, and those were
    pretty expensive, even for Duvolle.\"\n\n\"It's a drug? Why don't you synthesize
    it?\"\n\n\"We don't understand it fully. We believe we're only seeing the tip
    of the iceberg here. The rest of the material has been folded. It doesn't respond
    to duplication or synthesis like regular chemicals do.\"\n\n\"Have you tried it
    yourself?\" said Aki, incredulous.\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't quite have what it
    takes,\" Avagher replied. \"I scored 131/131 on the Federation Cognitive scale
    when I was at the university, and everyone knows you scored over 200/0.5. Highest
    score in two decades across all of the Federation's educational facilities, wasn't
    it?\"\n\nAki nodded distractedly.\n\n\"You have studied extensively across different
    fields,\" continued Avagher. \"Engineering, math, chemistry. It's actually quite
    remarkable you haven't made any significant discoveries yet, but that's not the
    issue. We feel that if we are to use the IN-06 we have, it has to be on a brilliant
    mind, one that's already primed with all the information required.\"\n\nAki pursed
    his lips in silent thought for a second. \"There has to be a catch,\" he said.
    He leaned back in his chair, lay one ankle over the opposite knee and crossed
    his arms. \"Let's say I take this drug of yours. Do I just get some great ideas,
    type them into a terminal and go home? There's something you're not telling me,
    here.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm going to be honest with you,\" said the other man. \"Yes,
    there is a catch. Since the compound is folded, its inner workings are not known
    to us. What we do know is that despite the very small dose, the substance manages
    to distribute itself evenly throughout the brain in less than two minutes. It
    then goes into hyperconnection mode, creating connections between synapses across
    the brain, like superhighways or shortcuts across the fabric. It does this for
    an hour to a progressively greater degree, not quite exponentially but not far
    from it. \n\n\"The subjects we've worked with before were fully coherent during
    this period, and were able to elaborate their ideas clearly so that they were
    readily understood by the team that went on to prove them. However, after only
    sixty minutes of exposure the connections start to saturate the mind. It's around
    that time that they become incoherent. The mind continues to function in some
    limited way \u2013 we can see that from the brain scans \u2013 but as of yet we
    haven't been able to communicate with them beyond that point. They seem to go
    into some sort of psychosis, which may be a result of the overconnection and overheating.
    After we cool the brain and provide the proper medication, they relax and seem
    quite comfortable.\"\n\n\"You've turned them catatonic? That's great, where do
    I sign?\" said Aki, staring at his old classmate with undisguised contempt. \"Why
    would I ever want to become a drooling vegetable in some Duvolle Labs basement?\"\n\nI
    think you are forgetting one big factor,\" said Avagher, lifting a finger briefly
    as he did so. \"Those three people we've done this with already. Each and every
    one has come up with something amazing. Remember Kanih Motoro? He solved the Kiesler
    integral problem in less than twenty minutes. It's already being put to use in
    sub-frequency EM shielding for capsuleer-controlled ships. And Kanih is not you,
    Aki. Just think about what you could discover. All these things people have been
    trying to crack for decades.\"\n\nAki stood up and walked towards the door. \"No,
    thanks. I'm sure this IN-06 works wonders for you guys, but I'm not at a point
    where I want to give up the rest of my life just to make a scientific discovery.
    I have a life. A wife and son.\"\n\n\"Inferno,\" Avagher replied.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It's
    called Inferno by the lab team. The IN-06. And yes, you do have a wife and a son.
    Is she happy? Is she proud of you? And the kid? Does he have a future? He's not
    going to have your education. You'll be lucky to have him signed up to the military
    college. But if you go along with this, Kia won't have a financial worry for the
    rest of her life. The suits are offering a fortune for your participation, regardless
    of the results. You'd pay off your debts with a fraction of the sum. Think about
    it, Aki. This is your chance. You were given this unique mind, this education,
    this rare opportunity. Are you going to waste it on the rest of your life? You
    could ensure your legacy here. Provide a future for your wife and kid. Isn't that
    what you really want?\"\n\nAki didn't answer. He walked out and slammed the door
    behind him, raising an alarmed look from Avagher's unnaturally attractive secretary.\n\n<div
    align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\n\"So you see, he wants
    me to take their drug, have my moment of bliss and in return you get freighterloads
    of money while I drool away the rest of my days in a Duvolle-sponsored luxury
    clinic. I can't believe he had the nerve to even suggest it! Did he tell you about
    this when he said he wanted to meet me?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Kia answered.
    \"It's ludicrous to even offer something like this. Is a single discovery worth
    your entire life?\"\n\nA trashy holoreel was playing on the living room display,
    but neither of them was really watching. Besides, it was hard to even see what
    was going on in the actual story with all of the overlaid advertising.\n\n\"Exactly!\"
    Aki snapped. He meant to go on, but before he could Kia stood up and went into
    Rias's room to help him with his homework. \n\nAki sat silently in the kitchen
    for a while, then retired to his office, fired up the terminal and looked at the
    schematics yet again. He started to spin the model as usual but found it hard
    to focus, his mind always going back to the audacity of that overgroomed, pompous
    former friend of his. *I don't need your fancy drugs. I just need a little more
    time*, he thought. \n\nThe articulated hologram of the prototype unfolded like
    the petals of a flower as he ran a quick thermal flow simulation. He'd run this
    simulation countless times before, though, and the results were the same as they'd
    always been. Aki sat there for a while, going through first the code, then the
    schematics, then the simulations, as if performing some kind of ritual.\n\nKia
    opened the door.\n\n\"I'm working,\" he said. \"Just give me a minute.\"\n\n\"The
    work will be there later,\" she said, pulling him away from the terminal. It wasn't
    until she kissed him that he noticed she was barely wearing anything. \"I've been
    waiting a while for this,\" she said.\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nAki
    watched the dim glow from Kia's imported cigarette illuminate her face and smooth
    naked torso as she took a deep drag. It had been too long. Between all his worries
    \u2013 the research, the money, his time away in orbit \u2013he'd forgotten how
    perfectly simple and fulfilling it could be with Kia.\n\n\"Did he really say he
    wanted to turn you into a vegetable just to get your ideas?\" Kia laughed and
    pulled the bedsheets up.\n\n\"Well, it's more complex than that. I'm not sure
    what I'm allowed to say. They had me sign all these contracts.\"\n\n\"I'm your
    wife. You can tell me. It's not like I'm going to run off to the press or sell
    industrial secrets. Tell me, what did he say?\"\n\n\"Well. There's a compound
    called Inferno. It's from wormhole space. From an ancient race. They have minute
    quantities of it. And if they give it to people, their brains form connections
    they wouldn't have formed before.\"\n\n\"Like a cerebral accelerator?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Like
    boosters?\"\n\n\"Nothing so crass. This is the real deal, apparently. I probably
    shouldn't be saying this, but... they gave it to Kanih Motoro.\"\n\n\"Motoro?
    Your old research assistant?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Avagher said he solved the Kiesler integral
    problem. Just like that.\"\n\n\"Motoro couldn't solve anything when you were working
    together,\" Kia mused. \"Didn't he just spend all his research time filling out
    forms for grants? He always struck me as someone who just worked hard rather than
    someone with a brilliant mind.\"\n\n\"Yeah, he scored 150/10 on the scale, I think.
    Something like that.\"\n\n\"And you scored over two hundred, Aki.\"\n\n\"Yeah,
    I did.\"\n\n\"Well, I hope he got a freighterload of money for it,\" she said,
    laughing, as she took one last puff of the cigarette.\n\n\"Actually, he did. So
    would I. Even just a part of it would pay off all our debts.\"\n\n\"All our...\"
    Kia coughed, triggering a deeper cough which sent smoke puffing through her nose.
    \"You're kidding me. They'd pay that much for what's in your head?\" She became
    very serious. \"It would mean Rias would never have to worry about anything in
    his life.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I'd be a vegetable.\"\n\n\"Yes. Absolutely.\" Kia sat
    still for a moment. \"Motoro solved the Kiesler integral?\" she finally asked.\n\n\"He
    did. That kid solved a problem that's been used as the definition of an unsolvable
    problem for decades. I mean, I tried factoring that for two whole semesters and
    never got anywhere.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't judge you if you chose to do this,\" said
    Kia in a low voice. She looked Aki in the eyes. \"I know you value your research
    over everything else. Even family. I've resented it at times, but I've learned
    to live with it and I know that you won't change.\" She looked down and was silent
    for a moment. \"I wouldn't judge you,\" she repeated then, softly.\n\nAki felt
    he should say that she was wrong, that she was more important than his research,
    but it wasn't true and he felt no point in lying to her now to make her feel better.
    Knowing of her acceptance eased some of the guilt he'd felt over the years; all
    those times he'd chosen an assignment in orbit over a day or two with the family.\n\n\"I
    could die without ever discovering anything,\" said Aki. \"I could get hit by
    a runaway cleaning droid tomorrow, or choke on a snack. I could catch one of those
    viruses that the immigrants bring down every day, or the power could go out in
    the air supply in the middle of the night. These things happen.\"\n\nTears had
    begun to form at the corners of Kia's eyes. \"I can't believe we're discussing
    this. I don't want you to do this. I don't want to lose you.\"\n\nAki felt a decision
    begin to come into view on the horizon of his mind. This was becoming more and
    more clear to him. Kia meeting Avagher hadn't been a coincidence. It was fate.
    There was something right about it, something pure, like a mathematical axiom
    or a universal constant. He was smarter than Motoro. His discovery would outshine
    anything that kid could ever have come up with. His mind was primed and ready.
    This was destiny.\n\nStill he wept a little with Kia, but more because she was
    weeping rather than out of any sadness he felt himself. His mind was illumined
    with excitement. *What will my discovery be?*\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nAt
    first glance, the Duvolle-owned lab looked like an expensive classroom. A desk,
    a neat stack of paper and pens of all different colors. Three state-of-the-art
    terminals were neatly arranged on the desk, above which loomed multiple digital
    whiteboards. In front of the desk there were several rows of seats. Avagher, seated
    next to Aki, was explaining how things would proceed.\n\n\"It's quite simple.
    You just relax and make yourself comfortable. There'll be a few people in here
    taking notes, perhaps asking some questions about specifics. It's very important
    you keep talking. We've seen people get so overwhelmed with their thoughts that
    they forget to tell us what's going on, and that's hardly practical, is it? It's
    not worth much if it's just happening in here!\" Avagher tapped his index finger
    on Aki's head. Aki smiled, though he wasn't really seeing the humor.\n\nA door
    opened on the side of one of the whiteboards, revealing the full research crew
    in a large adjoining room. Inside were what seemed like a hundred people, some
    hunched over screens showing biological readouts of the various microscopic sensors
    attached to Aki's body, others running simulations and studying various pieces
    of his preexisting research. Seeing that Aki was staring into the room, Avagher
    walked to the door and closed it.\n\n\"Best not think too much about them, even
    though each and every one of them is thinking about you. Just relax and enjoy
    the ride!\" Though Aki was excited about what would happen, he couldn't wait for
    Avagher's artificially white smile to be out of his sight.\n\n\"Let's do this,\"
    he said.\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nThe
    medical team sat Aki down in his chair. Again, the door into the room next to
    them opened. This time they wheeled out a polished white contraption that looked
    like a state-of-the-art medical instrument. It had a large oval hole, into which
    Aki's head slid comfortably. The innocent smooth hum of various servo motors obscured
    the fact that his cranium was being rather forcefully clamped and held steady
    with micrometer precision.\n\nA disembodied voice said, \"You are going to feel
    a pinprick in the back of your head, and a strange sensation inside your skull.
    This is normal, so no need to panic.\"\n\nIt was more than a pinprick. As he watched
    on the monitor, the sharp needle drove through his skull, penetrating deep into
    the cerebral cortex, where it began secreting the valuable chemical named Inferno.
    Aki could sense a tingling itch growing within his skull but he held tight, knowing
    this was just the insertion phase. As the itch spread out, the needle was subtracted.
    Finally, the carefully polished contraption let go of his head and he was wheeled
    out again.\n\n\"It can be good to focus on something other than what's happening,
    just while the compound takes effect,\" said the technician. \"Try to think about
    something simple, like your childhood.\"\n\nThe technician's face was strangely
    clear, his bloodshot eyes piercing, his skin more porous and detailed than it
    had appeared minutes ago. Looking around, Aki saw the room itself was clearer,
    too, as if previously he had been watching a muddied low-quality holoreel whereas
    now he was seeing things in full definition, all razor-sharp detail and vivid
    colors. There was also something remarkably lucid about his state of mind. The
    usual haze of self-doubt, regret, frustration and worry had vanished; in its place
    there was now a quiet waiting void.\n\n*My childhood*, he thought. As he let his
    mind wander down that path, images flashed before him at tremendous speed. His
    first swim in the ocean and the shock of the cold water enveloping him. Playing
    four-dimensional Quivolle with his mother at only three years of age, and seeing
    her surprise when he sorted all the pieces in less than eight moves. \n\nHe remembered
    extensive tests at the institute for gifted children, being allowed to sequence
    on a military-grade workstation when he was seven. His graduation party at ten,
    how excited he was to give an interview that was broadcast across the Federation.
    Seeing Kia for the first time when she was eighteen, in particle collider class.
    How she ignored him since he was still just twelve at the time. It would be years
    until she noticed him.\n\n\"Okay. Are you remembering things better than usual?\"
    The technician watched Aki closely. \"Perhaps focus on something more relevant
    to our interests now, like propulsion?\"\n\nAs soon as the word left his lips,
    patterns, concepts and theory began flooding into Aki's mind, as if the single
    word had let off an explosion that now expanded throughout his entire field of
    consciousness. He vividly remembered every formula and equation of standard applied
    thermodynamics and spatial theory, even the loosely formed ideas about supercritical
    energy diffusion he'd started playing around with during the undergraduate years.
    \n\nShapes started to emerge in his mind; articulate, complex, detailed patterns
    which wove threads between seemingly unrelated facts, fitting everything together
    in one infinite tapestry of truth. It wasn't very visual \u2013 the understanding
    was deeper than that \u2013 but he felt as if a perfect crystal was forming in
    his mind. He felt he understood the fabric of the universe and how it behaved.
    It was so clear now.\n\n\"You're going to have to talk to us, sir. Are you thinking
    about propulsion?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! I am. It's so clear, why it was going nowhere.
    I wasn't accounting for the ultraweak forces. You see, in most instances they
    are completely irrelevant. You only factor them in when simulating the collision
    of galaxies, the expansion of the universe or the distribution of dark matter.
    They are so insignificant that they don't count.\"\n\nHe was aware that he was
    babbling, but he didn't care. The technicians stared at him.\n\n\"It's like if
    you had a map of a house: you'd pretend it sits on a two-dimensional plane rather
    than on a curved surface, you know, the surface of a planet. But if the house
    covers half the planet, the rules change. You have to use different math. You
    can't use simple approximations anymore.\"\n\nAki had been writing on the whiteboard
    while talking and it wasn't until he paused and took a step back that he realized
    the equations he'd been writing down were not old or known. He felt as if he'd
    been explaining something that everyone knew, something well studied and explored.
    Yet, on the whiteboard, softly glowing, stood something no one had articulated
    before. He looked around, saw how everyone in the room was studying his notes
    intently, silently, inserting new equations into their terminals, running simulations
    and analysis protocols. \n\nThis felt good. Finally, Aki Luisauir was doing what
    he had been born to do. It felt right. He kept talking.\n\n<div align=\"center\"
    style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nForty minutes later, the air in the
    room felt uncomfortably thick and warm. Aki had been interrupted a few times,
    asked to pace himself. His mind was going so fast that it was tempting to skip
    out on topics he felt were trivial, but that were in fact the pillars of the axioms
    needed to understand what he was going on about. He felt a mild frustration with
    the lack of intellect in the room, how they just couldn't seem to catch up. His
    head was starting to feel hot, almost feverish, but he ignored the inconsequential
    discomfort of his physical form.\n\n\"Roughly twenty minutes to totality. Inferno
    is going to toast him soon.\" The intern watching the bioreadout spoke as if Aki
    wasn't listening, and he was right. Aki was busy explaining to the team.\n\n\"And
    by simply tuning the oscillations of the sub-atomic particles so that they are
    in phase, and applying the force evenly at the precise moment of resonance singularity,
    you could in fact jump a fairly large body, like a cruiser-class starship, around
    100 kilometers without significant energy cost. A kind of micro-jump drive. It
    might be expensive to build, but all the technology needed exists today.\"\n\nAki
    was rubbing his head frantically. Sweat was running down his face and stinging
    his eyes, and his shirt was quite drenched. He was finding it difficult to slow
    down, to form sentences and words to explain his thoughts. It took too much time.
    By the time he was halfway through a sentence, usually the train of thought had
    turned toward something new. His voice, his mouth, and other people's slow minds
    were all major bottlenecks. \n\nHe sat down at one of the terminals and tried
    hammering away rather than explaining everything verbally. He quickly outlined
    the control code for the micro-jump drive, in case the people around him didn't
    get what he'd been talking about. Still, his hands could only move so fast, and
    the terminal felt unresponsive.\n\n\"Hey, take it easy friend, just relax and
    work at our pace!\" Avagher said, smiling.\n\nSuddenly Aki's focus wasn't on math,
    engineering, spatial distortion or any of these topics. Unbidden thoughts of Avagher
    filled his mind. He remembered meeting Avagher in the kindergarten lab. They'd
    hung out together, made fun of the teachers. Aki remembered how they'd hacked
    into and reprogrammed military-grade MTACs at the base to run around and do gymnastics
    with their hundred-ton hulls, their mechanized arms and legs. He remembered how
    Avagher had introduced Kia to him. He'd wanted to talk to her for so long, but
    never had the drive to simply do it. \n\nAvagher had always been better like that.
    More confident. Aki couldn't understand why. While Avagher was less smart \u2013
    and certainly won fewer awards \u2013 he always thought he could do everything,
    and faced the world with that annoying smile. Aki found his mind performing a
    deep psychoanalysis of his old friend, something he had no interest in or time
    for right now.\n\nSuddenly, something clicked into place. A news blurb, seen on
    a holoscreen two months ago. Aki had been in orbit, supposed to be doing work
    but instead finding himself scanning pointless news items about what was happening
    planetside. Five people arrested on suspicion of transporting illegal boosters.
    Memorial service on the Hueromont Incident at the military academy. Science museum
    finally closed after years of dwindling attendance. Science museum closed. She
    said she met him at the science museum with their son. \n\nMore facts started
    to emerge, like little pinpricks. The holoframes in their apartment. Quite expensive
    devices for her to buy. When had she installed them? One day they had just been...
    there. They had Duvolle Laboratories markings. He'd never even thought about that
    before.\n\nAs he began digging into it, it began to dawn on him. An image of Avagher,
    ten years old, flashed before his eyes. He hadn't thought of this in decades.\n\nAnd
    his son, Rias. His dark scruffy hair. His round face. His round, familiar, face.\n\nAki's
    head felt as if it was burning. Finding himself still sitting in front of the
    terminal, he tried to stand but found that his feet weren't really responding.
    He was going to scream at Avagher, but he couldn't move his mouth. He suddenly
    realized he'd spent the last precious ten minutes thinking about Avagher, Kia
    and Rias. Was this it? Was this the end? \n\nThe research team seemed to be focusing
    on reviewing what Aki had already covered; some of the recording equipment had
    been turned off as they quietly discussed the findings. His hands could still
    move. He reached for the terminal and continued working on the micro jump drive
    code.\n\n\"He's still going!\" someone said, and their attention was on him again.
    The technician arrived with a pack of ice that he placed on Aki's head. Avagher
    commented: \"That's not really going to work, you know. He's burned out already.\"\n\nAki
    entered a few lines into firmware code for the main stabilization sequence. It
    took him forever to type, and he felt as if hot lava was boiling inside his head.\n\n\"Is
    it still valid?\" Avagher asked one of the researchers.\n\n\"Sure. I'm not positive
    on what exactly it does, though. It seems to improve the yield, but like with
    most of this stuff, no-one really knows how it works except for him, and I don't
    think he's in a condition to tell us. He's pretty much toasted.\"\n\nAki finished
    the last line, then collapsed into his chair. The medical crew surrounded him,
    took vital signs and wheeled him away. He didn't hear them or see them. He was
    already sliding into the scalding perpetual darkness and ensuing nightmare that
    was Inferno totality.\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nIt
    had been a long time since Kia and Avagher had taken time off together. He was
    being given more responsibility than ever at Duvolle, and some said that he was
    being groomed for CEO. Kia had taken up her own research again, and was successfully
    running a small pharmaceutical company in her spare time. Avagher had chartered
    an Opux luxury yacht with a small crew and was taking her to see all of the astronomical
    phenomena she had only dreamt of witnessing all her life. With all his work and
    continuing success at the company, he still had time for her, and that made her
    happy.\n\n\"Do you want to see the flaring on the solar limb?\" asked Avagher.
    \"The ship is fitted to withstand the most violent flares you can think of.\"
    Not waiting for a reply, he instructed the crew to take them on a close orbit
    of the sun. It was a fairly small red sun, not the most majestic in the region
    but possessing a curious intensity that made it interesting nonetheless. They
    warped closer and were quickly flooded with brilliant light, carefully filtered
    and balanced by the observation deck windows.\n\n\"Sir, you might be happy to
    hear that we actually have one of your inventions fitted onto this very ship.
    We recently acquired a Xarasier Micro Jump Drive. Perhaps you and the madam would
    like a demonstration?\" The captain was quite thrilled to have the actual creator
    of this new device as his passenger.\n\n\"Where would we jump to?\" asked Avagher.
    \"There's nothing here but us and the sun.\"\n\n\"A 100 kilometers forward,\"
    replied the captain with a smile in his eyes. \"Just for fun, really.\"\n\n\"Sure,
    let's give it a try!\" Avagher shouted jauntily as he put his arm around Kia.\n\nThe
    captain initiated the drive. Deep within its circuitry, the main loop started
    to spool up. As it calculated the correct coordinates, a small clause in its code
    ran an undocumented check, reviewing the passenger charter. As it detected the
    name Avagher Xarasier, a subroutine within it was initiated. It calculated the
    ship's position, projected jump coordinates, locations of nearby planets and the
    absolute position of the nearest sun.\n\nFrom the outside, everything seemed to
    function perfectly. Avagher was somewhat excited, since he'd never been inside
    a ship doing a microjump before. The engine continued to spool up and a mild vibration
    could be felt from the floor.\n\nSuddenly, the ship jumped. It didn't go 100 kilometers
    though. It went further than that.\n\nIn an instant, a few hundred kilometers
    deep below the glowing surface of the sun, a small cruise ship materialized. It
    took microseconds for the violent forces fuelling the sun to consume and entirely
    dissolve the ship, its crew and its two passengers. The disturbance caused a small
    solar flare to shoot up from the photosphere of the sun, the plasma arcing brilliantly
    for a few moments before collapsing again and merging with the twirling plasma
    on the solar surface.\n"

description: Aki Luisauir arrived at his laboratory late this morning, like most mornings.
  Even though he had slept throughout the night, he felt tired. Dwarfed by the surrounding
  machinery, he threaded his way between old propulsion system prototypes meant for
  assault frigates, research that had been very promising three years ago but had
  come to no fruition, leaving him pretty much alone in what now felt like a tomb
  rather than a bustling laboratory. His work had seen no credible result, and he
  now faced an [...]
