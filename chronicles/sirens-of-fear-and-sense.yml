    Providence Directorate Headquarters, New Caldari<br>\nJanuary 26th, YC115</p>\n\nThe
    hall was golden white, a prismatic front chamber of narrow glass walls. She'd
    always found it a strangely ostentatious scheme for a man so given to brute force
    politics, but she supposed everybody was allowed their idiosyncrasies, and Tibus
    Heth surely had not shown many of those through her time as his personal assistant.
    At least not until the past few weeks.\n\n\"The incident *has* had quite an effect
    on him,\" Dr. Kiras was saying as they passed through the glass corridor, their
    steps clacking off the polished surfaces in unconscious unison.\nMiss Marisaki
    nodded. \"What are the biggest issues?\"\n\n\"Well, he's been pretty tight-lipped
    with me about it, but I'm cleared for conversation with a lot of the brass, and
    to my mind there has been a definite pattern showing. Delusional ideation, heavy
    anxiety, obsessive neurosis. By most accounts he's seeing shadows in every corner,
    and by some accounts they're closing in on him.\"\n\n\"That's nothing new,\" she
    replied. \"To some degree he always thinks there's a conspiracy going on somewhere.
    And I mean, in the strictest sense, he's probably right.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said
    the doctor. \"Pardon me, Miss Marisaki. I'm first and foremost a physician, of
    course, and it's not for me to speculate on political truth and lies. But there
    are... you see, there are certain hints, certain psychological markers,\" and
    here he stopped for a bit and pinched his upper lip pensively, \"that indicate
    that he may not be arriving at all of his conclusions in the, ahh... the healthiest
    of fashions.\"\n\nMiss Marisaki regarded him for a moment. \"The Derj's,\" she
    said.\n\nDr. Kiras nodded ruefully. \"It could be,\" he said. \"The deposits are
    growing bigger. He is starting to show more pathway damage. It could very well
    be that the trauma of the incident, combined with the stress caused by these worries,
    is accelerating the process.\"\n\n\"How can it be reversed?\"\n\n\"Reversed is...\"
    the doctor shrugged apologetically and shook his head, \"very optimistic. Medically,
    it's always difficult to say. It's such a recently discovered disease that its
    mechanisms aren't fully clear to us yet. Psychologically, though, there is some
    evidence to indicate that paradigm and attitude can play a significant part in
    slowing down the advance of symptoms.\"\n\n\"You're telling me he'll live longer
    if he stays positive?\"\n\n\"In so many words, yes.\"\n\n\"The foremost physician
    in the Caldari State is telling me mantras are gonna save our leader's life?\"\n\n\"Not
    at all, Miss Marisaki. I just mean that if he's under this kind of stress in the
    first place, medical measures are less likely to be effective. It takes a strong
    immune system to not succumb, and he is directly weakening his own with every
    day he passes worrying. His refusal to accept psychiatric help is most worrying
    in this capacity.\"\n\n\"Thank you, doctor,\" she said. \"You are dismissed.\"\n\nThe
    doctor spent just a split second staring at her with his lip bitten, then he bowed
    slightly to her, turned and left. She herself turned toward the incongruous steel
    door at the corridor's end, but then stopped again to briefly speak into a wrist-mounted
    radio:\n\n\"Imara Marisaki, Head Office, Clearance 5, requisitioning all conversational
    records between Doctor Rami Kiras, PDID 2420, and any officers Clearance 4 and
    above for the last month and a half. Confidentiality breach, executive override
    4419. Required on my desk by noon today. Thank you.\"\n\nShe straightened herself,
    discreetly tucked away a small crease on the front of her suit, squared her shoulders
    and pushed a button next to the door. A three-tone chime of square waves, hollow
    in the glass corridor, announced her presence.\n\n\"Executor Heth, sir?\" she
    said. \"May I come in?\"\n\nThere was another chime. The door slid open.\n\n<div
    align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nThe room Miss Marisaki
    now stepped into was a jarring counterpoint to the welcoming gleam of the outside
    corridor. Her superior, Tibus Heth, Executor of the Caldari State and undoubtedly
    its most powerful single person, had designed his quarters expressly to provide
    himself with an element of surprise whenever state visits were called for. Lulled
    into their customary sense of comfort and splendor by the tastefully opulent corridor,
    guests would suddenly enter a chamber so small and sparse as to almost seem like
    a prison cell, were it not for the little things restricted to prisoners on even
    the best days in the State: a small flower in a tiny windowsill with sharp needles
    of light from behind it rendering its outline into chiaroscuro, a picture in a
    frame next to a simple cot with several blankets, and a desk with a small control
    console on it, at which a gray-haired gray-eyed man now sat, engrossed in a datapad
    sitting on his lap. Lines of worry etched him from eyes to ears. His sallow cheeks
    were salted with stubble.\n\n\"How are you feeling, sir?\" she asked.\n\nHeth
    didn't look up from the luminous datapad in his hands. \"Good as can be expected,\"
    he replied. \"They're still at it.\" He brought his balled hand up from the datapad,
    then abruptly splayed his fingers open. A moving image was thrown into the space
    above the pad, showing a man and a woman standing in front of a broken billboard.
    The man was wearing a leather jacket with a giant golden logo emblazoned on it,
    the emblem of an anti-Provist movement active in the low-sec constellations of
    The Forge. The two of them were screaming at someone behind the camera.\n\n\"Amazing
    how little the people truly comprehend, try as we might to educate them,\" said
    Heth, setting the datapad on his lap and rubbing the bridge of his nose. \"And
    the capsuleers are fanning the flames, I hear. No great surprise there. What's
    on the agenda for this morning?\"\n\n\"A fair few things, sir.\" She sat in a
    chair on the desk's opposite side. \"Haatakan Oiritsuu is still asking to speak
    with you. She said it was only going to get more urgent, until suddenly it would
    be too late. Not entirely sure what she means by that.\"\n\n\"Let her wait,\"
    said Heth, his hand on his forehead, his elbow resting on the edge of the desk.
    It was impossible to see whether he was surreptitiously reading the datapad. \"Her
    information these past few weeks has been contradictory and misleading,\" he continued.
    \"I want to keep her guessing for now. Just watch her for a few days and report
    anything she does to me. Every little gesture, every peep, you understand?\"\n\n\"Understood,
    sir. Secondly, the reports coming in from the expeditionary forces continue to
    be dire. We've lost even more ground. Resources are stretched.\"\nHeth nodded
    gravely, then asked: \"What about my investigation? Anything new?\"\n\n\"Nothing,
    sir,\" replied Miss Marisaki. \"The only thing we still know reliably is what
    we've known since the beginning: your assailant was one of our own, and he was
    working in conjunction with an unknown force of capsuleers.\"\n\nHeth was silent
    for a little bit. He placed the datapad on the table, drew a deep breath and stood
    up. Just as he did so he grabbed the edge of the table with a sudden grimace.
    Miss Marisaki furrowed her brow.\n\n\"Sir, Doctor Kiras has expressed concern
    for your... \" she began.\n\n\"Doctor Kiras,\" said Heth, waving a hand at her.
    \"I don't trust that man. You know what he said to me? Told me I would feel better
    if I talked to a qualified professional. I asked him, what are you if not a qualified
    professional? He said it's not so simple. I told him would a qualified professional
    help me root out my conspirators? He didn't have much of an answer for that.\"
    He walked over to the small window, grasped one of the plant's leaves between
    thumb and forefinger, stroked it gently.\n\n\"I would like you to place a classified
    message to a Dr. Yoshun, at the Corporate & Family Practices Clinic in Sarogar,
    North Arcurio,\" he said presently. \"Tell him I need to see him, here, at his
    earliest convenience, and that the matter is urgent.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\"
    said Miss Marisaki, noting down the order. She swallowed hard, steeled herself,
    then broached the subject she had been dreading all morning. \"Then there is the
    matter of your Directive, sir, from yesterday,\" she said.\n\nHeth looked at her
    and a measure of focus came into his bloodshot eyes. \"I trust it's being put
    into place post-haste,\" he said.\n\"Not quite, sir,\" she replied.\n\nFor the
    first two years of her job, she had been terrified whenever that purposeful gaze
    burrowed into her, certain that if her words failed her she would find a quick
    professional grave at the State hierarchy's foul-smelling roots, with the rest
    of the bottom-feeders, parasites and other things that crawled. Somehow her ambition
    had always overridden her fear, though, and she had become adept at finding inspiration
    within the very pressure of those moments where every word, gesture and inflection
    counted for so infinitely more than the sum of their parts. It was for this reason
    that she was probably the only person in the entire Caldari State that could have
    delivered to Tibus Heth the message contained in her next few words.\nShe cleared
    her throat and spoke.\n\n---\n\n### 2\n\n<p style=\"font-family:'Shentox';font-weight:500;margin-top:.75em;\">\nCaldari
    Providence Directorate Headquarters, New Caldari<br>\nONE DAY EARLIER</p>\n\nCaldari
    Navy Grand Admiral Morda Engsten had been quiet and unassuming this afternoon;
    generally brusque and imposing, her manner today was uncharacteristically laid
    back. She seemed almost apologetic. Miss Marisaki couldn't recall seeing the Admiral
    behave this way before, and found herself increasingly curious about what lay
    behind the older woman's strange facade.\n\n\"You see,\" the Admiral was saying,
    \"there's simply no way that the War Room could ever accept a command like this,
    particularly in this kind of time frame. For one thing it's tactically unsound.
    We have reports that the Federation has been setting up clone soldier enclaves
    on Corfeu for weeks now, and we've only recently started an initiative to incorporate
    ours into our existing squadrons. Added to that, our expeditionary forces have
    been taking heavy losses. We're stretched far beyond our limits. I mean, we're
    barely holding on to Caldari Prime as it is. \n\nScrapping our most valuable military
    resource...\"\n\n\"Retooling,\" interrupted Miss Marisaki.\n\n\"Whatever you want
    to call it. Pulling the clone soldiers is not an option. Doing so at this point
    would be nothing short of suicidal. Every single member of the Command Council
    is against it.\" Slowly, like a cold wave washing up to nip at the heels during
    high tide, her voice had gained power as she spoke, and she was now tapping on
    the tabletop in front of her with two fingers, accentuating her points.\n\n\"This
    'taint' Heth is obsessed with,\" she continued, still crescendoing, \"is the unsubstantiated
    brainchild of an Empress who's grown unstable through gaining too much power too
    soon. Not the first time that's happened in history, I'm sure you'll agree. There
    is no hard evidence to indicate that it's true whatsoever. Any new technology
    on this level brings with it its inherent dangers. The rogue soldier who made
    the attempt on the Executor's life has been interrogated multiple times and found
    to be nothing more than a stark raving lunatic. The conspiracy is all in our esteemed
    Executor's mind.\"\n\nMiss Marisaki felt a flush of anger. \"Is there any precedent,
    Admiral,\" she asked, looking down at her documents and studiously avoiding eye
    contact with Engsten, \"for the Council to completely veto a directive from the
    Chief Executor?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Admiral Engsten curtly, \"but it's a measure
    we can take nonetheless. You know the law as well as I do.\"\n\n\"It's classified
    as an extreme measure, though,\" replied Miss Marisaki, \"so it must abide by
    all the legal ramifications implied in such cases.\"\n\n\"We are well aware of
    that, Miss Marisaki, and we've discussed it at length. I suppose we'll see how
    far Executor Heth is willing to go in this brinksmanship game of his, but despite
    his recent behavior we still place our faith in his understanding that a prolonged
    legal battle at this level \u2013 not to mention at this point in time \u2013
    is going to undermine the entire structure he's been attempting to build. Should
    it come to that, the members of the Council will no doubt find our places within
    any new structure. The Executor might not be so fortunate.\" Her words had grown
    soft again, an ominous receding tide.\n\n\"Admiral, what you're saying can quite
    easily be interpreted as treasonous,\" said Miss Marisaki.\n\n\"If the leader
    refuses to take responsibility for his own declining health and act accordingly,\"
    replied Admiral Engsten, \"then he cannot be expected to take responsibility for
    his own nation. This is not treason, Miss Marisaki, far from it. This is concern
    for the State, over the needs of one man. Anyone is fallible, even more so if
    they are blind to their own fallibility.\"\n\n\"I think I have heard quite enough
    of this,\" said Miss Marisaki, standing up. \"You will hear from the Executor
    before long. Good day, Admiral Engsten.\"\n\nThe Admiral's eyes followed her out
    of the room.\n\n---\n\n### 3\n\n<p style=\"font-family:'Shentox';font-weight:500;margin-top:.75em;\">\nKuisen
    City<br>\nIKAMI V, Ikami System, The Forge Region<br>\nJanuary 27th, YC115</p>\n\n\"We
    got a clone squad coming in,\" said Staff Sergeant Uha.\n\n\"No shit?\" said his
    Assistant Squad Leader, Corporal Okawari.\n\n\"Yep shit.\" Uha's weapon was laid
    out field-stripped in front of him. He removed a large elongated piece of metal
    from the table.\n\nHis companion watched him with interest. \"Why you getting
    rid of your IR mount?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not worth the weight for riot control,\"
    replied Uha. \"We're only zapping crowds anyway, don't need the accuracy. Much
    rather stay mobile, use the headgear if I get into some kind of one-on-one. Less
    accurate, but these guys don't have anything long range anyway. Bunch of pebble
    shooters at best.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I guess,\" said Okawari. \"I dunno, I like the
    original heft. Used to it.\"\n\n\"Yep. Well. You're about twice my size, so I
    guess it makes sense,\" said Uha and chuckled.\n\nA brief silence passed while
    the Staff Sergeant continued to clean his weapon. \"They're going to try mixing
    the squads,\" he said, suddenly. \"Don't let any of our guys hear it yet, but
    they're gonna put a cloner in every squad.\"\n\nOkawari looked incredulous. \"What
    the f...\"\n\n\"Yeah. They wanna explore opportunities for cooperation. Try to
    break the ice a bit.\" He smiled grimly down his gun barrel.\n\n\"Ice?\" said
    Okawari. \"Ice?! Do they not remember what happened at the joint training op last
    week? Or the month before? Hell, don't they remember *Okushin*? The Heth attempt?!
    That was a goddamned cloner!\"\n\n\"That's unconfirmed, Corporal. Those are just
    rumors.\"\n\n\"Oh, come on. Don't toe the party line with me, Shio,\" said the
    bigger man, momentarily forgetting, as he so often did with his friend, that he
    was subordinate. \"The way he was throwing those guys around, nobody's gonna tell
    me that was any kind of normal god damn soldier. And then they dragged him away
    and nobody's heard a peep since? Seriously.\"\n\n\"Our orders are orders, Corporal.
    Orders trump hearsay when you're a soldier, remember?\" He inserted a pin into
    his rifle's receiver, then unfolded his stock with a sharp clack, not looking
    at his second-in-command. \"Now we've got an anti-Provist rally to attend to,
    and we gotta live with our new comrade, however long that is. He should be here
    any minute now.\"\n\n\"Wonderful,\" said the big man, turning to exit the mobile
    bunker. He opened the door to reveal, in the gathering darkness, the outline of
    a distant city whose lights threw a purple streak across the sky. \"Sure he's
    a goddamned charmer like the rest of 'em.\"\n\nCasting one last baleful look at
    his friend and squad leader, he slapped his helmet on and went outside.\n\n<div
    align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nSome three hours later
    the two men were standing in the middle of a square formation of riot-equipped
    soldiers, facing down a mob composed of State citizens who had been taken to the
    edge of their tolerance, who rested content in their righteous cause, who knew
    that their time had finally come.\n\n\"Where's the cloner?\" said Okawari.\n\nUha
    looked around. \"He should be easy to pick out. Asshole's even bigger than you.\"\n\n\"Then
    why am I not seeing him anywhere?\" said Okawari, scanning the crowd.\n\n\"He's
    supposed to be at your nine, front echelon edge,\" said Uha. \"It's...\" He put
    his hand to the side of his helmet. \"Wait one. Copy, this is Tarkan Squadron.\"\n\nUha's
    great head swieveled around the square. Beyond the mass of protesters, he could
    see a broken wall with graffiti on it. Squinting, he was able to make out a number.\n\n___*514.*___\n\n\"Say
    again, Kaura leader,\" said Uha. He looked up, scanned the buildings lining the
    square. Behind his visor, Okawari could see that his friend's eyes were wide.\n\nHe
    turned his head again to look where Uha was looking, and just then a deafening
    explosion shook the ground underneath them. Another one followed, then another
    one, and soon the purple streak thrown by this unfortunate city had turned a deep
    dark hue of red.\n\n---\n\n### 4\n\n<p style=\"font-family:'Shentox';font-weight:500;margin-top:.75em;\">\nCaldari
    Providence Directorate Headquarters, New Caldari<br>\nJanuary 27th, YC115</p>\n\nImara
    Marisaki was sitting in her office, reviewing her information. Heth had grown
    upset at the news of the Command Council's decision, so upset that before she
    even fully knew why, she had found herself couching the matter in subtle untruths
    that shielded him from the full gravity of the situation. *If he won't see a shrink*,
    she thought now, rationalizing her actions as cold sweat pushed its way down her
    back, *I'll just have to god damn well act as one*.\n\nShe was aware that she'd
    suddenly plunged herself neck-deep into a dangerous situation, and while the potential
    consequences for herself terrified her deeply, they were nothing next to the prospect
    of having Heth do something drastic at this sensitive juncture. He still held
    executive power, so if he felt like pushing it all the way against his opponents
    in the War Room, he would be able to do untold damage in the short term, before
    any legal ramifications would fully come to the fore.\n\nTrying to get a better
    grasp on the state of her superior, she had been looking over Dr. Kiras's transcripts
    of interviews with commanding officers. None were particularly heartening. One
    of them called the Executor a dangerously unstable presence. Another outright
    questioned his sanity. Everywhere she saw indications of mistrust and hostility.
    Ignoring the knot in her gut, she made a mental note to leave those reports well
    out of Heth's hands at all costs.\n\nHer disturbed reverie was interrupted by
    her aide at the door. His face was ashen and his hands quivered as he wordlessly
    passed her a datapad. Within seconds, the ashenness had spread to her face as
    well.\n\n\"Notify him I'm on the way. Right now,\" she said, standing up.\n\n<div
    align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\n\"Sir.\"\n\n\"What
    is it, Miss Marisaki?\"\n\n\"Sir, there have been... there have been several...
    attacks.\"\n\n\"Attacks?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Coordinated. All of them at anti-Provist
    rallies. It appears they were all... they were all carried out by clone soldiers.\"\n\n\"Clone
    soldiers.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Killing civilians.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"At
    rallies where those civilians are protesting my government.\"\n\nMiss Marisaki
    swallowed hard. \"Yes, sir.\"\n\nLeaden silence blanketed the room. Summoning
    up all her courage, with fire burning through her gut and her syllables coming
    in uneven staccato, she said:\n\n\"That's not all, sir. One of the attacks...
    was...\" \u2013 she took a quick breath \u2013 \"was carried out in Arcurio.\"\n\nHeth's
    eyes drilled into her. His lips parted slightly.\n\n\"North... Arcurio. Sir.\"
    She cast her eyes down, and the next word came in a meek whisper: \"Sarogar.\"
    Her regular composure was nowhere to be found. She was naked to the elements.\n\nA
    long silence passed. Then:\n\n\"I would like you to do something for me, Miss
    Marisaki.\"\n\n\"Anything, sir.\"\n\n\"I would like you to mobilize the Navy,
    the armed forces and every single corporate force we have. Get a list of the locations
    of every single soldier clone vat we have, every single trooper enclave, every
    bunker, every barracks. Do you understand me? Every single one. I want them eradicated.\"\n\n\"Sir...\"
    she paused. \"Sir, the Council will...\"\n\n\"The War Room can do as the War Room
    sees fit. If they wish to stand in my way, they are welcome to try their level
    best. This is an executive order, to be carried out immediately. \n\nImmediately,
    Miss Marisaki.\" The soft tone of his voice and his absolute composure were more
    terrifying to her at that moment than any outburst she had ever seen from him.\n\n\"Y...
    yes, sir,\" she stammered, and made to leave.\n\n\"One more thing before you go.\"\n\nShe
    turned again. His face didn't seem so gray anymore.\n\n\"Get me Haatakan Oiritsuu,\"
    he said.\n\n\"As you wish, sir.\"\n\nShe left the room. Heth sat down again.\n\nThere
    was a very short silence, and then Haatakan Oiritsuu, former leader of the Kaalakiota
    Corporation and his unwilling hostage-ally, appeared on his datapad, surrounded
    by her garden of flowers.\n\nHer face was impassive. She raised her eyebrows,
    cocked her head slightly, and as she cut the head off a blooming red flower she
    mouthed the words:\n*Too late*."
