    the Caldari merchants that shuttled between the core systems it was considered
    a good omen if, on approaching the Iyen-Oursta stargate, they might witness the
    hypnotic ballet of the Lutins. Some Gallente locals even took to worshipping these
    strange dancing lights, that would on rare occasions surround an approaching ship
    like a swarm of angels until the jump to Perimeter was made. The more belligerent
    of the Amarrian traders meanwhile saw them as mere baubles, strung up in space
    to calm the women, children and slaves before the warp drive\u2019s wrench pulled
    them briefly into timeless non-existence.\n\nRumours had spread across the Border
    Zone of vengeful ghost drones returning from the climactic battle at Iyen-Oursta,
    perhaps to enact a haunting toll for the Caldari secession a century previous.
    Conspiracy theorists, as is their way, held that the spectral phenomenon was evidence
    of Jove experiments. Ironically, it was the dismissive Amarrians who capitalised
    most -- on the widening belief among Minmatar slaves that if they witnessed the
    spectacle of lights, their firstborn son would be blessed with freedom.\n\nDespite
    the fact that the detour sometimes doubled the length of their journey, slaver
    vessels would divert through the Gallente Border Zone in the hope that a sighting
    - staged or otherwise - would serve to quiet an obstreperous cargo. Some slavers
    lent the spreading belief further credence by freeing the Luti, the children subsequently
    born of \u2018blessed parents\u2019. Others weren\u2019t as compassionate, taking
    instead to neutering their human cargo, often by furtively poisoning the ceremonial
    Kapli bread baked in honour of a Lutin blessing.\n\nWhilst a few scientific studies
    were conducted on the phenomenon (or \u2018Iyen Pixies,\u2019 as they became colloquially
    known), efforts were half-hearted. Welcoming the income afforded by the increased
    traffic, the Amarr Empire exerted its pressure on the academic community. In the
    end, even the most inquisitive of academics were dissuaded from seeding their
    sensor arrays around the increasingly busy node.\n\nMeanwhile, among pockets of
    forced-migrant Minmatar workers, the legend continues to flourish. Kapli bread
    is still baked by those hoping for release from captivity across plantations and
    farms everywhere, and in a quiet corner of San Matar, on the darkest day of the
    year, the Lutinlir, (\u2018Festival of lights\u2019) attracts thousands of Luti
    families now living in the relative freedom of the Ammatar enclave.\n\nOf the
    widespread theories put forward through the years to explain the fabled Lutins,
    the one most favoured by the scientific community is that of superheated plasma
    escaping through poor venting from the stargate itself. It is thought that if
    approached at the right speed, correct angle and proper warp drive frequency,
    the vented plasma is attracted away from the jumpgate\u2019s boson sphere and
    towards the approaching ship. According to the theory, the plasma\u2019s reaction
    to the ship\u2019s shields is what creates the brief, dazzling and harmless display
    of multispectral lights.\n\nOver time, perhaps due to the advances jumpgate technology
    has seen over the years, the number of sightings has dropped considerably. Of
    the few reports that are made, most are dismissed as elaborate hoaxes. As a consequence,
    the Iyen-Oursta system has become something of a quiet bypass for traders as opposed
    to the highway it once was. Still, every once in a while, a hopeful soul may be
    seen roaming around the gate, wishing for a glimpse of that fabled beauty."
