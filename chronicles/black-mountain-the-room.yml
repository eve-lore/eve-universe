    as I appreciate your enthusiasm, you need to stop this nonsense. If you walk up
    to someone, if you distract them for a second and then manage to take them down,
    you kill them on the spot. That's what you do. Okay? If you absolutely have to
    leave a personal mark, you find something lying around and shove it into their
    eyesocket. What you do *not* do is let them get up and make a run for it before
    throwing a knife into their backs. Let's be professional about this. And stop
    crying.\"\n\nDraea, standing in a crouch and breathing heavily, looked up at him
    and said, \"I'm not crying.\"\n\n\"That ain't sweat.\"\n\n\"Little runt kneed
    me in the groin. It sets off the tear ducts.\"\n\n\"Told you she had balls!\"
    a teammate shouted to them.\n\nAlad leaned his head back and rubbed his eyes.
    \"Alright!\" he shouted. \"Session over, thanks, go away, people! Dinner's at
    seven.\" On command, the holograms in the area faded out, shields blinked into
    oblivion, and various pieces of cover, hurdle and barricade collapsed into themselves
    and slid silently down into slots on the floor.\n\nAlad extended a hand to Draea,
    who accepted it and stood up. One of their victims was lying on a bunch of black
    paper-mach\xE9 rocks nearby, snoring.\n\n\"I'm getting a little tired of this,
    Alad,\" she said.\n\n\"Are you, dear?\"\n\n\"No, actually, scratch that. I'm getting
    so utterly sick of it that I could vomit blood. If I have to go through one more
    stupid exercise with one more stupid fake victim where I push a rubber pin against
    their gut and tell them they're dead, I swear on all that is holy, I'm going to
    shove this pretend knife through my own eye until it rattles inside my skull,
    let the last beats of my dying heart carry it through my body, and *pull it out
    my ass.*\"\n\nShe sighed. \"Also, the martial arts sessions are stupid. Nobody
    does small-joint manipulation anymore.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you're opinionated.\" He
    caught her glimpse. \"No, seriously, I am. It means you care. And I'm glad that
    you care, because you're being promoted.\"\n\nShe stared at him. \"What, just
    like that?\"\n\n\"You've been on countless recon missions, completely unsimulated,
    protecting our interests in all sorts of situations. You've shown a remarkable
    ability to stay alive and to ensure that others ... well, don't. And your IPM
    index-\n\n\"My what?\"\n\n\"Int-Per-Mem, dear, don't interrupt. It shows quite
    amazing numbers through the entire scale, mental and physical. *I'd* be scared
    if I knew you were on my heels.\"\n\nThe victim got up, yawned and started walking
    away. \"There's another group coming in,\" Alad said to him. \"Where are you going,
    Placx?\"\n\n\"For a smoke,\" Placx said without slowing.\n\nAlad watched him go,
    then turned back to Draea. \"Follow me.\"\n\nThey walked through the compound,
    passing the exercise rooms, the altered states chambers and the torture vaults.
    Each was designed to test the subject's physical, mental and spiritual tolerance,
    to find their breaking points and how they would react when pushed to that level,
    and even, for the torture vaults, what they'd do to others. A team member prone
    to murder everyone around him was as much a liability as one who'd go catatonic.\n\nThey
    moved down to a lower floor, passed through corridors Draea rarely traversed,
    and at last came to an unremarkable door that she had never even noticed before.
    She stood in front of it, but it didn't open.\n\n\"Special access only, dear,\"
    Alad said.\n\nDraea raised an eyebrow. There were no visible scanners or locking
    mechanisms in front of the door. Nevertheless, when Alad stood in front of it,
    the door hummed softly and opened. The space inside was almost pitch black, with
    only one cone of light shining down brightly on a metal chair a few steps into
    the room.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" Alad said. \"You've already passed.\"\n\nDraea shrugged,
    walked in and sat on the chair. Behind her, the door closed, and what little outside
    light had been flowing in was cut off.\n\nShe sensed someone nearby, but she did
    not feel threatened.\n\nA voice, issuing from a speaker high above, said, \"You
    are alone in this room.\"\n\n\"You lie,\" she said. It was not a rebuke; it was
    a statement of fact.\n\nThe voice, sounding pleased, continued, \"You have now
    been promoted to task force operative.\"\n\nThe voice fell silent for a moment,
    in quiet expectancy. Draea said, \"... thanks?\"\n\n\"Do you understand what it
    is that the operatives do?\"\n\n\"Killing people is a given,\" Draea said. \"The
    rest doesn't really matter, does it?\"\n\n\"That depends,\" the voice said. \"Before
    we continue, you should know that you will never be allowed to speak of this to
    anyone not on your own task force. You do, however, need to know a few things
    if you're to do a decent job for us. Does the name Book of Emptiness tell you
    anything?\"\n\n\"Not really. Sounds Amarrian, but that's about it.\"\n\n\"It was.
    Supposedly a lost holy book, one that would bring immediate ascension to the reader.
    It is now the chosen codename for a machine that we're after. Set at low power
    it has the capacity to heal some mild psychological issues. On high, it has the
    power to brainwash people.\"\n\n\"Ah, so you want me to get it for you.\"\n\n\"No.
    We want you to destroy it.\"\n\n\"You do?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Are you serious?\"\n\n\"It
    is a non-negotiable part of our arrangement. We have spies out right now, various
    scouting forces. Once we get a positive lead, we'll send out one of the task forces.\"\n\n\"So
    why me?\" Draea asked.\n\nThe voice replied, \"You have excelled at what you do.
    You've gotten this far and managed not to die, and our nanomachinery tests prove
    that you have a natural aversion to the Book's effects. Aside from this curious
    obsession of yours to hit people at range with ridiculous weapons, you are one
    of our absolute top performers. Not only that, but in your previous life you showed
    a remarkable acumen for flying under the radar. We need agents who can work on
    the edge without falling off or bragging to everyone who's watching.\"\n\n\"Do
    I at least get to know who you people are?\"\n\nThe voice laughed. \"If you want,
    though it won't make much of a difference either way. We're a special section
    of the Society of Conscious Thought. We're operating on behalf of the Hyperconsciousness
    agenda.\" The voice paused again, and when Draea registered no expression, it
    continued, \"There is a final test. We know you're capable of committing atrocious
    acts both in cold blood and in the heat of battle.\"\n\n\"Damn straight,\" Draea
    said.\n\n\"But it's one thing to do it against an enemy you dislike, and quite
    another to do it against someone who hasn't done anything to you.\"\n\nAnother
    light turned on, shining a bright cone down a little way from Draea. It illuminated
    a small metal table on which lay a knife with a very long and narrow blade - a
    knife useable for both slitting throats and stabbing hearts - and a woman in a
    chair, tied and strapped in, wearing only underwear and a bra. The straps were
    so tight and numerous that her body and head were absolutely immobile, and both
    her throat and her wrists were exposed, the latter strapped to the chair's handles.
    She was gagged, and there were streaks of tears and snot running down her face.\n\n\"I
    like how you let her wear a bra,\" Draea said. \"Otherwise this'd just be so undignified.\"\n\n\"Personally,
    I wanted to strap Placx in there, but they overruled me,\" a different voice said
    from overhead.\n\nDraea looked up and grinned. \"Alad?\" she said.\n\n\"I swear,
    that man's played victim for the last time. We just cannot have people slouching
    around here.\n\n\"Should I do it, Alad?\"\n\n\"Do anything you like, dear. But
    do it to the hilt.\"\n\n\"If we're all ready here-\" the other voice said.\n\n\"Oh
    yes, by all means. Let's treat this with the reverence it deserves,\" Alad said
    with exaggerated seriousness, then went quiet. After a few seconds he added, \"No
    pressure.\"\n\nDraea slowly walked to the woman and the table, where she picked
    up the knife and weighed it in her hand.\n\n\"What's her name?\" she asked.\n\n\"Irrelevant,\"
    the nameless voice replied.\n\n\"That's for me to decide,\" Draea said. \"And
    besides, since you're so concerned with cold blood, I hardly think it'd make things
    any easier for me if I knew her name.\"\n\nThe voice said, \"Still-\", but Alad
    cut in with \"Inibjer.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Draea said. She looked Inibjer in the
    eye and said, \"If it helps, I've done this before.\"\n\nShe tossed the knife
    in the air a couple of times, then leaned down to Inibjer and whispered, \"I'm
    not going to kill you. Don't worry. I'm going to walk away slowly, and they'll
    have to find someone else to do the job. I might even be able to get help, put
    a stop to this.\"\n\nTears started running down Inibjer's eyes, and Draea said,
    \"Be strong.\" Despite the restraints, Inibjer tried to nod, but all that came
    out was a tremor.\n\nDraea slowly walked away, then, in one swift motion, she
    turned, raised the knife and threw it with massive force. It whizzed through the
    air and sliced just past Inibjer's head, grazing her right temple and bouncing
    off the wall beyond.\n\nThere was a sigh from above.\n\nFrowning, Draea walked
    past Inibjer and picked up the knife, then stalked back to her, said, \"Sorry,
    dear. I lied,\" and leaned over the prone victim. Inibjer trembled and shivered
    for a moment, then gurgled and went slack, maroon rivulets trailing down her arms
    and chest.\n\nDraea smiled, stroked Inibjer's hair and cheek, then absent-mindedly
    wiped her hand on her shirt. Behind her, the outside door slid open with a metallic
    hum. She turned and walked towards it, but hesitated at the exit. \"Alad?\" she
    said.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"What would've happened if I'd refused to kill her?\"\n\n\"Oh,
    we'd have filled the chamber with poisonous gas.\"\n\n\"Are you serious?\"\n\n\"What,
    you think I'd want to go in there and do it personally? You've got a *knife*,
    you psychopath.\"\n\nShe left the chamber, laughing loudly."
