    \"God; Emperor; Theology Council.\" Nusi tapped the triangle he'd drawn on the
    board. \"That's the theological underpinnings, at least, and - luckily for you
    - this isn't a politics class, so that's all we cover.\" He glanced up at the
    timepiece on the wall. \"Well, that\u2019s it for  today's material, and we still
    have time to spare. It wouldn't do to let you go early, so...any questions?\"\n\nNo,
    he reflected in the silence, it wouldn't do to be too forward, would it? That
    would be gauche, under the circumstances. This group was a fast-track class; unprompted
    enthusiasm would be unseemly. He moved forward a little.\n\n\"Annoli, you were
    looking thoughtful a few minutes ago. What was troubling you?\"\n\n\"Well...\"
    she started slowly, \"is it true that the Khanid aren't allowed in the Council
    chambers?\"\n\n\"Ah, I should've known it would involve his Highness. He's too
    old for you, you know...\" A few quiet chuckles rumbled around the room, and then
    a hand shot up. \"Yes, Garund?\"\n\n\"I've heard it's never stopped him in the
    past, sir.\" More laughter.\n\n\"Ok, ok, let's not be having fun at his Highness'
    expense.\" Nusi shot a quick glance into the corner of the room. \"Does anyone
    know the answer to Annoli's question?\"\n\nA more furtive hand went up. \"Aleine?\"\n\n\"My
    pa tole me that it was the symbol that they dint like. He said there was something
    about it that upset them.\"\n\n\"Good, very good. Yes, the Khanid people, be they
    Imperial citizens or Royal subjects, are allowed entrance, but the Royal Seal
    is...well, it's not banned, per se, but it's not welcome there either. Now, does
    anyone know why?\"\n\nA deeper silence, filled with thoughtful faces.\n\n\"Well,
    since we have time, I'll explain properly. We're going to go on a journey through
    some symbols, because you can't really appreciate the significance of the situation
    until you understand the background. First\u2013\"\n\nNusi moved back to the board,
    wiped it clean, and drew a circle with a small inverted triangle at the base.\n\n\"What's
    this? Teilf?\"\n\n\"That's, uh...the first man?\"\n\n\"The first men, yes. Unbroken
    circle, God become man - looks a bit like an upside-down egg, I always thought.
    That's probably symbolic of something, too... Anyway. First men. This leads to\u2013\"\n\nA
    second symbol, one half-circle above the other, open sides away from each other,
    with the same inverted triangle at the base of the upper one.\n\n\"Do you know
    this one as well, Teilf? No? Adi?\"\n\n\"Something to do with the dark?\"\n\n\"Exactly.
    This is after the Fall and so on, during the Long Dark. Man and God entirely separate,
    with man below on his planets and God above in the heavens. An age of savagery
    and barbarism and general unenlightenment - an age which still persists to this
    day outside the confines of the Empire. And, yes Annoli, outside the Kingdom as
    well. His Highness remains an enlightened man in that respect. Which brings us
    to\u2013\"\n\nA more familiar symbol, the two semicircles laid one on top of the
    other, with the upward-arcing one broken where the other crossed it.\n\n\"This
    one you know; it's the Imperial Seal. When we came out of the Dark and formalized
    the Imperial Creed, man and God were reunited together again, albeit imperfectly.
    United but not conjoined, primacy of the Divine and the rest. This is Citizenship
    101 stuff, which I'm told you've all passed now, yes? Good. Aleine, you have a
    question?\"\n\n\"Yeah, uh..what does this have to do with the Khanid?\"\n\n\"I'm
    getting to that! One final detail you need to know about the Imperial Seal. You
    remember from earlier that the Theology Council asserts that the rule of God comes
    before the rule of man? Well, the symbology at work here is the underpinning of
    that concept. Just as the Emperor above rules over the people below, so God above
    rules over man below. Primacy of the Divine isn't sufficient: the implied heirarchy
    is critical to the rationale.\n\n\"So then. When Khanid II upped and left, Heideran\u2013\"
    a glance again into the corner of the room. \"That is to say, of course, Emperor
    Heideran VII, immediately declared him in breach of precedent, along with various
    other things. The Theology Council, though, followed due process and sent a firmly
    worded message to Khanid inviting him to explain his actions. There was a bit
    of a delay, and then his Highess (as he is now) replied with this\u2013\"\n\nThe
    same symbol again, but drawn upside-down.\n\n\"The delivery was, in fact, a very
    nice rendering of the Imperial Seal, done carefully in his House colors, but inverted.\"\n\nNusi
    looked around. A lot of blank faces, but a few sparks of dawning comprehension.\n\n\"Rial,
    what property of this little sign is making your eyes bulge in such a curious
    manner?\"\n\n\"If...well, if...if the Council gets its authority...the thing on
    top... If the Imperial Seal is saying that God's law is better than man's law,
    then...\" The student glanced back over his shoulder.\n\n\"Then the Royal Seal
    is saying that man's law is, shall we say, more important than God's law. It's
    a historical discussion; nobody's saying that it's true. But yes, that's what
    Khanid was trying to say \u2013 or at least, that's how the Council interpreted
    it. With a single, simple image, he denied the theological root of the Council's
    authority, telling them that he could damn well do as he saw fit, so long as he
    broke no secular law \u2013 which he hadn't, because Heirs are above such things.
    How, do you suppose, did the Council react to this...Indlar?\"\n\n\"I guess maybe
    they weren't very happy?\"\n\n\"Hah! You're damn right they weren't happy! They
    passed down judgement pretty promptly after that, and even though those Justices
    have all since passed on, the Council as an institution still hasn't forgiven
    Khanid. That's why it's extremely unwise to take the Royal Seal into the Council
    chambers. They see it as a direct challenge to their authority, even now. Teilf,
    you have a question?\"\n\n\"Didn't they, like, know about the symbol before? Like
    when Khanid started using it or something?\"\n\n\"No, because Khanid's reply was
    the first time anybody had seen it! It seems that he made it up just for this
    purpose, but decided to keep it afterward as his Royal Seal. Only his Highness
    knows exactly why, but once he made the decision, he stuck with it. There's other
    readings of it, too, and again, nobody but Khanid knows which ones are intended
    and which aren't. For example, given this \u2013 the inverted Imperial Seal or
    the Royal Seal or however you want to think of it \u2013 you can arrive at this\u2013\"\n\nThe
    second symbol, with the two separated semicircles, but inverted.\n\nA glance again
    into the corner of the room. \"This symbol is frowned upon, but I'm allowed to
    explain it in this context so you know the truth. I'm not going to ask you to
    speculate on its meaning; there are many ways to interpret this, some of which
    you may come across over the years, but there's only one correct interpretation,
    which is that the Imperial Creed is part of our heritage and our culture and our
    very identity, but that our future is among the stars. I stress again that Khanid
    II has never indicated that his Seal implies anything more than rejection of the
    Council's authority, and that other readings of the symbology here are simply
    incorrect. And that, I hope, answers the original question in a reasonably comprehensive
    manner.\"\n\nA hand crept up lazily in the back corner of the room.\n\n\"Zweir,
    you have something to ask?\"\n\n\"You've shown us five symbols. What about the
    sixth?\"\n\nNusi stared long and hard at the boy, and then answered with a smile
    that contained no hint of mirth.\n\n\"There is no sixth symbol, and that's all
    we have time for today. Class dismissed.\"\n"
