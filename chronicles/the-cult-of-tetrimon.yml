    the present day, the Tetrimon are seen as a small fanatical religious cult, that
    have been responsible for a number of disturbing terrorist attacks against targets
    both amarr and foreigners.\n\nThe truth of the matter is something that the Amarr
    heirarchy would rather forget.\n\nThe roots of the cult lie in the year 21460,
    at the end of the reign of Zaragram Ardishapur II, also known as the \"Mad Emperor.\"
    At that time the Amarr Emperor was the leader of the Apostles, the first among
    equals, and his authority was channeled through the Apostle Council. But as soon
    as he came into power Zaragram started issuing decrees, most of them religious
    in nature. Many of these decrees directly contradicted the Scriptures, uprooting
    and eradicating many of the most sacred traditions of Amarr society. Zaragram
    gave himself the status of a God-Emperor, and ruled the Empire according to his
    whims.\n\nOne nobleman of the Ardishapur family grew so ashamed of what his own
    grandfather had done to the traditions and religion of the Amarr that he entered
    the \"City of God\" in the Shastal system, and with his own hand killed the Emperor.
    Before the nobleman was cut down by the surrounding guards, he raised his bloody
    hand and cried \"a manu dei e tet rimon \" - I am the devoted hand of the divine
    god. (\"Tetrimon\" means \"Divine Devotion\")\n\nThe Council of Apostles, the
    rightful ruling agency of the Amarrians, took back their former power, and attempted
    to restore the Ammarian faith. The nobleman was beatified as Saint Tetrimon, and
    the Council of Apostles took heed of his actions, and created an Order to reverse
    the corrupting influence of the now deceased Emperor Zaragram II - The Order of
    St Tetrimon.\n\nThis Order was given the task of purifying the Amarr faith, of
    preserving the original scriptures, and of eradicating apocrypha and deuterocanonical
    chapters (i.e. removing those chapters of the scriptures which disagreed with
    the \"canon\" of the Amarr faith, or those chapters which had been added to the
    scriptures more recently.) The Order went on to ensure that the decrees of Zaragram
    were reversed. All icons and pictures of him were either destroyed or his face
    and name scraped out, and his city was laid to waste.\n\nDuring the moral reforms
    which took place from 21875 to 21950, the Council of Apostles was stripped of
    its powers, which were transferred to the Emperor and the newly formed Privy Council.
    The Emperor was elevated to the status of the Empire\u2019s spiritual and worldly
    leader. Many of the Apostles\u2019 supporters were strongly reminded of the Mad
    Emperor Zaragram II some 500 years earlier, but many of those voices were silenced,
    forever.\n\nOne of the nay-sayers was Tetrimon IV, the current grand master of
    the Order of St Tetrimon. Unlike many, he did not openly defy the Emperor, but
    instead hid the records and artifacts of the Apostles.\n\nThe new Emperor, still
    insecure in his newly elevated position, gathered those religious leaders supportive
    of him into a special assembly to create a new canon of scriptures that would
    increase the moral authority of the Emperor. This assembly became permanent and
    was named the Theology Council -- defenders of the new religious and political
    order. Their Inquisitors were much feared throughout the Empire. Under their ruling
    fist many aspects of the Amarr faith were purged and modified to fit the new political
    order of the Empire - with the Emperor as the supreme and infallible voice of
    God.\n\nThe Order of St Tetrimon survived in small groups, often finding themselves
    at odds with the Theology Council and the Privy Council, but still openly carrying
    out their work of preserving the original liturgical records of the Amarr faith.
    In 22762, with the breakup of the Empire and the forming of the Khanid Kingdom,
    the Emperor issued a decree suppressing the Order of St Tetrimon, asserting that
    he did so to maintain peace and tranquility within the Empire. Tetrimon houses
    and colleges everywhere were seized by the local authorities. Some Order members
    were imprisoned; some were driven into exile. The Grand Master of the Order, Lozera
    Riana, was declared a heretic and imprisoned in the holy city of Dam-Torsad, where
    he died two years later.\n\nThe Order remained active in the Khanid Kingdom where
    Khanid II, for his own political reasons, would not allow the Imperial decree
    to take full effect. There were also accusations laid against both the Sarum and
    Ardishapur families concerning secret support for the Order, but they retained
    enough power in the Privy Council to ignore these accusations. Over the following
    years, the Tetrimon were forced to learn to defend their beliefs, and eventually
    were strong and skilled enough to strike back against those who they felt were
    corrupting the hearts and minds of the Amarr people. During the slave uprising
    of 23216, the Tetrimon reappeared in the Amarr Empire in force, and an agreement
    was reached with Heideran VII, whereby the Order were allowed free passage through
    the Empire in return for assistance against Minmatar forces. Ships flying Tetrimon
    colours became much feared by the young Republic Fleet during this time for their
    fearless attacks and the suicidal fury shown by their pilots.\n\nDuring the remaining
    reign of Heideran the Tetrimon were left untouched, on the understanding that
    they would not attempt to undermine the rule of Heideran. Quiet they remained,
    aside from a few actions taken against the Kor-Azor family -- specifically against
    the Heir Doriam, who flouted traditions with his releasing of slaves and liberal
    views."
