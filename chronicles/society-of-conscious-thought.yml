    Society of Conscious Thought, or SoCT, was founded three centuries ago by the
    Jovian Ior Labron. As a rule, Jovians are not very spiritually inclined, but those
    Jovians that are take to their spirituality with the same vigor and zeal as to
    everything else. The SoCT has, through the ages, acted as the outlet for the spiritual
    needs of the Jovians, although that role is only a secondary one today.\n\nThe
    Society\u2019s story is a long and complex one.  Starting out as a cult created
    to explore humanity's spiritual and religious feelings and needs (with the primary
    aim of discovering the meaning of life, no less), it later expanded into the realm
    of politics and, for a little while, effectively became Jovian society's shadow
    government. This, however, did not last for long; other political factions joined
    together to break their power, with the result that the Society was banned for
    a considerable period of time. Yet they still lurked in obscurity, reverting back
    to their mystical past. As the years passed the Society again began to exert itself,
    but wisely and carefully this time, making sure to just skirt the borders of the
    hostile political arena.\n\nOnce again, the search for spiritual enlightenment
    became the focus of the SoCT.  They embarked on a journey of frenzied technological
    research on the matter, resulting in some very interesting theories and facts
    on the nature of man and his connection to the universe.\n\nThe SoCT had, in the
    traditional way of secluded spiritual sects, sought refuge in remote areas, building
    their residences there. Even while the Society was most active in politics, they
    still maintained their homes far away from large human settlements, favoring isolated
    regions planet-side or in deep space. Only in recent years has the SoCT become
    a little less reclusive, setting up offices in urban settlements in order to increase
    their visibility to the general public.\n\nIn their remote abodes the Society
    has built up mini-societies emphasizing self-sufficiency; a trait strong among
    the Jovians. These sprawling places, often resembling huge fortresses, house everything
    from living quarters and food-growing facilities to laboratories and libraries.
    Each enclave, called a kitz, is a separate entity, but communication between kitzes
    is frequent.\n\nEach kitz maintains a school for educating their members in the
    scholarly or scientific fields. At first, all the students were children of SoCT
    members, but a few decades ago the Society started admitting, each year, a small
    number of children from 'outside,' even non-Jovian ones. The applicants are chosen
    by the Society and their choices seem to many to be almost random, because there
    is no visible pattern as to who gets in: neither race, gender, social standing,
    nor even talent and intelligence by themselves seem to play instrumental roles.
    Many wealthy parents have tried to increase their child\u2019s chances by donating
    large sums of money to the SoCT, but statistics have shown that this has little
    or no effect.\n\nIn any case, most people agree that the education the children
    receive within the Society\u2019s walls is first-class and every graduate is a
    sought-after employee anywhere he or she goes. An astonishing proportion of SoCT
    graduates reach a prominent position later in life, becoming presidents of multi-stellar
    corporations or governmental ministers. Little wonder, then, that people regard
    the SoCT schools as breeding grounds for world leaders.\n"
