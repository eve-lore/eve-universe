    most of the Minmatar tribes the act of painting one\u2019s face before going into
    battle is an age-old tradition. In days past, some of the more warlike tribes
    took this a step further by tattooing their faces in the same style, giving them
    what effectively amounted to permanent war paint. The main disadvantage of these
    facial war tattoos was obviously that they were a permanent feature. This made
    their usage quite a bit less common -- after all, portraying as aggressive a state
    to others as the war paints represented did not lend itself equally well to all
    forms of interpersonal communication.\n\nBut high-tech developments have opened
    up a new way of expressing one\u2019s aggressive intentions. The latest fad in
    tattooing is so-called nano-tattooing. The nano-tattoos are very small microchips,
    surgically implanted between the epidermal and dermal layers of the skin. These
    microchips are connected to the nervous system via the hair and sweat glands'
    paravertebral ganglia, and are activated when the host becomes emotionally upset
    or excited. When active, the microchips emit dark or light color (depending on
    the person's skin color), resulting in patterns appearing on the face.\n\nThese
    nano-technology war tattoos come in various versions. The most common ones link
    the microchips' activation directly to the host's emotional state, making it necessary
    for the host to control their own feelings if they want to influence the appearance
    and disappearance of the war tattoos. Other versions allow the person direct conscious
    control over activation, but Matari tend to frown upon those, the general consensus
    being that these more user-friendly chips suggest a lack of self-discipline in
    the host.\n\nSince they first arrived on the open market a decade ago, the nano
    war tattoos have taken Minmatar society by storm. They are especially popular
    among the younger generation of aviation and space faring personnel. While the
    custom has spread to other races, most notably the Gallenteans, it is still almost
    exclusively confined to the Matari.\n"
