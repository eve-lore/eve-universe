    woke with a scream boiling in his lungs and the world on fire. The heat of it
    bit into his skin, raw and feral, and the sudden, molten pain turned his vision
    white. The smell of burning flesh choked the air inside the dropship cabin. Balac
    had been in the field since the beginning. He had, as Krin was fond of saying,
    \u201Cseen some shit.\u201D *Images of Krin\u2019s smiling face being torn apart
    by a plasma round.* He stared at the inch of air that now separated his lower
    leg from the rest of his body. *Yeah, some shit,* he thought, numbly. The flesh
    on his upper thigh bubbled softly. It was a clean cut. No blood. Whatever had
    chewed through his leg had cauterized the wound instantly. Already the nanites
    in his bloodstream were converging on the trauma site, and as they worked, the
    pain subsided to a steady thrum.\n\nBalac sat mesmerized by the severed limb sprawled
    in front of him. For a mad moment, it seemed that he could just reach out and
    put it back on, slip it on as easily as an old shoe. The *click-whir* of movement
    snapped him alert. He looked up. The drone looked down. For a long moment they
    stared at one another before, slowly, its front limbs detached from the roof of
    the dropship and its segmented body arched downwards. It hung there, waiting,
    dangling in a way that seemed idly threatening, possibly curious, and then with
    stop-stutter grace pulled itself up and out of the hole it had made in the dropship\u2019s
    roof, the skitter-scratch of its movement echoing in the empty cabin below. Seconds
    later, a viridian beam sliced through the hull, paring apart a section of metal
    that clanged to the floor no more than a few feet from where Balac sat. His thigh
    twitched, in fear or recognition he didn\u2019t know, but Balac was already moving.
    Kicking and cursing, he dragged himself over the edge, grunting as he dropped
    the last few feet to the ground.\n\nOutside, cords of smoke twisted into a broken
    sky. Balac watched as, in the distance, dark shapes swam through a haze of smoke
    and settling dust. Hundreds of them trawled back and forth across the wide, arid
    bowl. Skitter drones were among the first wave of Reclaimers sent in after the
    fighting died down. Cutting, grinding, and tearing, they reduced anything left
    on the battlefield into manageable waste, ready to be collected by the swarms
    of Harvesters that followed in their wake. With single-minded focus, they erased
    the battlefield, making sure nothing of value went to waste. Behind him, Balac
    could hear the drone going busily about its work. In a few hours, he thought,
    it would be as though the battle had never happened. As though they had not fought
    and died and bled here. It was then that the gnawing unease that had been growing
    inside him burst into realization. *The battle was over!* And yet for some reason
    he was still here.\n\nHe ran two fingers across his forearm and the embedded display
    reacted instantly, conjuring a shimmering topographic map of the area. In any
    given battle, the map would be overlaid with dozens of blinking bio signatures
    pinpointing the location of his fire team and any enemies within scanning range.
    Now, it was empty. Balac blinked. He was alone.\n\nHotswaps were common in areas
    of the galaxy where the fighting was particularly intense. There was seldom time
    to pack everything up. Far more efficient to redeploy on the frontlines and let
    the Reclaimers do the cleaning up. Somebody in operations would hit the kill switch
    and every clone keyed with the proper ident would drop dead where they stood.
    Seconds later they would wake up on the other side of the planet or half a galaxy
    away \u2013 the exact location seldom mattered anymore - ready to fight. This
    time Balac never made it.\n\nHe drew his sidearm. A Minmatar-designed weapon,
    the weight of it felt good in his hand. Familiar. Like a warm breeze on the Matar
    plains. Like the smell of wild Rikmal at dawn. It felt like home. He wondered
    idly if he would ever see it again.\n\n*\u201CYour body is worthless,\u201D* said
    a long ago voice.\n\n*\u201CEquipment can be replaced. Your knowledge is what\u2019s
    important. Your experience is what matters. Whatever happens, you get back into
    the fight by any means necessary.\u201D*\n\n\u201CStandard operating procedure,\u201D
    Balac finished for the voice, lifting the weapon to his temple. The metal felt
    cool against his skin. There was no-one around. No CRUs and no waystations that
    he knew of. And definitely no MCC. If he died, would he even wake up in his clone
    body? *Probably. Maybe.* He couldn\u2019t be sure. His hand trembled slightly.
    On his worst nights, he had prayed for death. The true death. To join Kali and
    The Hundred as they rode across the Sky Road for all eternity. His finger tightened
    on the trigger.\n\n*I need your help, Traveler.*\n\nIt was as if someone had breathed
    the words into his ear, and Balac almost blew his brains out from the sheer surprise
    of it. Instead, he jerked the weapon around and leveled it at the space where
    he expected to find the person who had somehow crept up on him. His sudden movement
    caught the drone\u2019s attention. It twisted its torso in his direction, but
    detecting only Balac, chirped indignantly and resumed its methodical dissection
    of the dropship, prying it apart with the care of a mother and the precision of
    a surgeon. Balac almost fired on it out of spite.\n\n*You must listen.*\n\nThis
    time, Balac felt the voice more than he heard it. Felt it in the knit of his augmented
    bones, in the slow turn of his genetics. He wondered absently if this was what
    insanity felt like.\n\nHe tried to stand then, but overbalanced and landed on
    his freshly amputated limb. Pain clawed up his spine and his pulse slammed in
    his ears.Instinctively, he grabbed at the wound, which only made the pain worse.\n\n*You
    are here for a reason. There is something you must see.*\n\nThrough gritted teeth,
    he grunted, \u201CSorry, but I\u2019m a little busy right now. Maybe another time.\u201D\n\n*You
    must head south. There\u2019s something you need to see.*\n\n\u201CYeah, you said
    that already.\u201D\n\nThe voice pressed on. *It must be you, Traveler. Only you.
    You must come quickly.*\n\nBalac glanced down at his stump. \u201CSure, I\u2019ll
    get right on that.\u201D\n\nAnd then the voice was gone and Balac felt silence
    seep back into the world, the kind of thick quiet that comes from exhaustion.
    From a world that, in the aftermath of such sudden explosive violence, had grown
    numb. He pushed himself upright and went back to studying the map. One way or
    another, he decided, he was getting off this planet. But it quickly became obvious
    that the map was hopelessly out of date. His suit\u2019s built-in sensors were
    severely limited, and the last global refresh \u2013 each fire team was supported
    by a networked TACNET augmented by ground- and air-based surveillance units -
    had been hours before. If he'd had any doubt he was alone, the absence of reliable
    telemetry was proof enough.\n\nHe picked and prodded his way across the virtual
    terrain for what seemed an interminably long time and was about to shut off the
    map to conserve energy when he saw it. A communications outpost five hundred clicks
    from his current position. *Radio for help.* As plans went, this was pretty straightforward,
    but he didn\u2019t have much else going for him just then. It was his best shot.
    The biggest problem was getting there. He didn\u2019t much like the idea of dragging
    himself across five hundred kilometers of rocky terrain on his stomach. He started
    crawling anyway.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long to find what he was looking for:
    a C12-KLK sniper rifle. It leaned against a blood-soaked rock, as if it had been
    waiting for him all along. The Kaalakiota-manufactured weapon was a favorite among
    mercs. Using microscale railgun technology, it effectively weaponized velocity,
    placing an otherwise inert round accurately downrange in excess of 2,500m/s. It
    could easily penetrate two-inch-thick depleted uranium plating from over a thousand
    meters. It would also make a fine crutch. Using the rock for purchase, Balac pulled
    himself to his feet and tucked the upended rifle under his arm.\n\nFinding transport
    proved a good deal harder. What hadn\u2019t been wrecked beyond repair had already
    been pulled apart. All around him, white-hot sparks flashed in the quickly settling
    dark. The Reclaimers were nothing if not efficient. He stood there for a moment,
    unsure of where to go.\n\nBalac tried to make sense of the rock and sand and shadow.
    In the dying light, it all looked the same to him. The wind had started to pick
    up, and flecks of sand stung his face. He couldn\u2019t imagine the sort of weather
    that had hewn the ragged, awkward columns... And then he saw it, a shape that
    was less than the ghost of a memory. He turned toward it, moving with more certainty
    than he felt. He picked his way up a short slope of loose gravel. It was hard
    going, but in the hours since he first set out, he\u2019d become quite adept at
    using the upturned rifle to pick his way across the shale and loose rock of this
    world. He crested the small peak and saw it just as it had been in his mind\u2019s
    eye.\n\nHis heart leapt in his chest at the sight of the smooth-curved Light Attack
    Vehicle, exactly where he had left it. And then fell to his feet as he saw the
    familiar shapes of Skitter drones moving towards it. He counted two. Without hesitation
    he dropped to the ground, ignoring the pain that fleeced up his half-limb, tucked
    the rifle neatly into the crook of his arm, and fired. The lead drone crumpled
    in a heap, and even as it did the second was turning and heading for the slope
    and Balac. Reclaimers were not designed to fight. But they were programmed to
    protect themselves and their salvage, and as Balac knew all too well, they were
    more than capable of doing that.\n\nThe Skitter drone moved quickly across the
    uneven terrain, closing the distance with alarming speed, its long legs a blur
    of motion. Balac fired and missed as the drone cut between an overhang, the round
    pulverizing the shale outcropping just as the drone disappeared behind it. He
    adjusted his aim, tracked just ahead of its zig-zagging path, exhaled, and fired
    again. This time the round tore through the drone\u2019s torso, which shattered,
    pieces twitching horribly, in some unfelt caricature of pain. Then he heard a
    familiar noise and realized his mistake.\n\nThe skitter-scratch sound reached
    his ears an instant before the third drone \u2013 the one he never saw - mounted
    the ridge and reared up, pincers stabbing and tearing at the air in front of it.
    Balac dropped the rifle, simultaneously pulling his nova knife, and with practiced
    skill slammed the blade up and in, the white-hot edge activating on contact, cutting
    into the soft underbelly, the buckled metal tearing at his flesh as he buried
    his hand into the drone\u2019s abdomen. Blood, his own, poured from the drone\u2019s
    wound. It practically shone against the brushed metal luster of the drone. The
    momentum of the strike carried him forward but, without a leg to steady himself
    with, fell over, teeth gritted tight as he collapsed on top of the drone. It flailed
    frantically beneath him, one of its limbs catching and tearing open his armor,
    gouging a deep red line along his side. In response, Balac leaned heavily on the
    knife, driving it in up to his elbow. The heat of pain and then, after, the warmth
    of blood flowed along his arm. The drone\u2019s twitching grew slower and then
    stopped altogether. When he was certain it was dead, Balac pushed off it and rolled
    onto his back, breathing heavily and grasping for his rifle.\n\nWorking quickly
    in case more Reclaimers showed up, Balac pulled a corpse free from the driver\u2019s
    seat, got in, touched his hand lightly to the dash \u2013 the vehicle\u2019s onboard
    systems synced immediately with his suit \u2013 stalled, cursed his missing leg,
    restarted the engine and peeled out, the tires spinning then gripping as the four-wheel-drive
    Methana accelerated out of the loose gravel. Balac didn\u2019t look at the corpse
    as his high beams flashed across it, pale features defined briefly and then gone,
    swallowed in the black of night. He didn\u2019t need to. He already knew the dead
    body was his own.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t been driving long when the voice spoke again.
    *You said you would come immediately. You lied.* Balac thought it sounded genuinely
    hurt.\n\n\u201CI promised nothing. Look, I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t help you.
    I\u2019m getting off this planet. Tonight.\u201D\n\n*You will not find what you
    seek.*\n\n\u201CWell, then I guess one way or another one of us will get what
    they want tonight.\u201D\n\nBalac didn\u2019t.\n\nThe communications outpost was
    nothing but a crater, a half-kilometer-wide wound of rock and metal. Billions
    of ISK obliterated. Balac could only guess at what happened. For all their greed,
    for all their talk of bottom lines, the corporations were a spiteful breed. Whoever
    lost this location must\u2019ve decided that if they couldn\u2019t have it, then
    no one else would either. Or maybe it was a warning. Whatever the reason, it no
    longer mattered.\n\n\u201CYou win.\u201D He said, knowing the voice was listening.
    \u201CTell me where to go.\u201D\n\nBalac drove through the night in silence.
    Perhaps sensing his mood, the voice spoke only when it needed to.\n\n*Follow the
    river bed east 40 kilometers. Continue due south for 10 kilometers.*\n\nAnd so
    it went until, just as the light of a freshly cracked day seeped in over the horizon,
    the voice simply said, *Here.*\n\nIt looked no different to Balac than any of
    the sparse dryland he had traveled across over the course of the last six hours.
    He wondered, not for the first time that night, just how insane he really was.\n\n*Now
    dig.*\n\n\u201CI have a better idea,\u201D he said and fished around in the vehicle\u2019s
    stow crate. He came up smiling, his hands filled with Tri-nine explosive.\n\n\u201CHope
    there\u2019s nothing fragile down there,\u201D he said to no one in particular,
    and started digging. After he had dug a small hole, placed the shaped charge,
    refilled the hole, and retreated behind the cover of the LAV, Balac pressed the
    remote trigger.\n\nThe earth sighed, a deep sucking in of air, and then bellowed
    as it spat a tower of dirt into the sky. Balac felt an odd sense of petty satisfaction
    as clods of soil rained down.\n\nWhen the smoke and dirt and dust cleared, Balac
    lowered himself down into the hole, which was far larger and deeper than he had
    anticipated. He had, he guessed, tapped into an underground cave of some kind.
    He coughed, choked on the millions of dust motes that clung to the stale air,
    and wished he had thought to bring a light. As his eyes grew accustomed to the
    dark, he noticed the thin outline of a shape, an obsidian surface discernible
    only by how much darker it was than the black around it. Balac had almost walked
    into it before he realized it was there. He ran a hand across its ice-cold surface,
    which, despite being directly underneath the blast, didn\u2019t appear to have
    a scratch on it. He was still marveling at how impossibly smooth the surface was
    when an opening appeared and the voice spoke.\n\n*Welcome home, Traveler.*"
