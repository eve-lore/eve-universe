    tiny sliver of pain begins to curl its way up the back of my head.\n\nShadows.
    Darkness at my periphery. It\u2019s starting again, then. I briefly wonder if
    I\u2019ll be able to finish my set before I\u2019m overwhelmed. Seventy-seven,
    seventy-eight. The sweat feels cold on the back of my neck. Eighty-nine, ninety.
    More shadows. I release the bar and drop softly to the mat. Enough energy expended
    for now.\n\nAs has become my ritual, I go over to the window and open it. The
    breeze off the river brings a cavalcade of smells. Its insistent whisper tells
    of unwholesome pleasures, of deadly spices, banned music, sinful screams behind
    shuttered glass. This is that kind of neighborhood, I guess, though you\u2019d
    never know it from walking here in broad daylight.\n\nThe laser-carved chrome
    pillars toothing the maw between second- and third-floor porches glint in the
    twilight as the neighborhood prepares for its nightly shift change. Boost vendors
    and feedbots desert the streets, replaced by uploaders and trikes. The sun begins
    its dive behind the mountains, leaving only a pinkish stain in the sky. The shadows
    in my head, as if emboldened by their literal brothers snaking out of every crevice,
    start ramping up their attack. Just a few minutes now. I take a deep breath, grit
    my teeth, and begin pacing my circle. Gonna be a long hour.\n\n\\***\n\nSixty-seven
    minutes later I take a look at my watch and realize I\u2019m late for class. Striding
    across my wood-paneled loft, satisfied at my indifference to the splinters lodging
    themselves in my bare feet, I grab my coat and my pad. Shoes, then hat. Dentcard,
    shades, check. Out of here.\n\nDownstairs in the last of the fading twilight I
    see Big Orphus huddled in the chipped wooden door frame, trying to light the rolled
    bundle of leaves clutched between his purple lips. I throw a greeting his way.
    He doesn\u2019t respond, but that\u2019s to be expected: Orphus only talks when
    the moon is right.\n\nMaking my way down Baillard Avenue, I\u2019m greeted with
    familiar sights. Peregrix district, this small stretch of Caille that runs from
    Baillard in the east over to Crystal in the west, isn\u2019t a dangerous zone,
    even though many people of questionable persuasion call the place home. It\u2019s
    just that they\u2019re all too busy doing legitimate business to waste their time
    hurting anyone.\n\nPeregrix is one of the few places left in the city where dupe
    boosters can still be legally sold. Six years ago, the city council passed a law
    requiring all newly registered chemical compounds to undergo a four-month noncommercial
    vetting process to keep them off the streets.\n\nPeregrix\u2019s high concentration
    of formerly enslaved Intaki and Brutor immigrants\u2014many of whom have severe
    respiratory illnesses from their days spent in toxic environments\u2014allows
    it exemption from the rules, meaning we always have the latest quasi-crash or
    protodrop, stuff that\u2019s so new it hasn\u2019t had time to become illegal
    yet. Thus it is that due to the blessed combination of welfare state and enterprising
    basement chemists out for quick cash, we can be howling at the rafters all day
    and no one can stop us. Praise democracy.\n\nI\u2019m through with the hard stuff,
    though. That whole thing\u2019s run its course for me. Used to be I\u2019d hang
    off the balcony at Surio Grande every weekend, suspended in monofilament, showering
    the dancers with lace blossom and feeling the universe breathe through me, but
    that got old as gold eventually. The mind adapts. The times change. Movements
    come and go, swept along on neon-lit currents of cultural flux. The multicolored
    whirl of the present becomes the good old days, replaced by black-and-white repetition,
    repackaged versions of the real. And always around the corner, lying in wait,
    is the next thing, the it thing, tendrils of novelty outstretched and ready to
    catch you in their thankfully diverting embrace.\n\nLight rain renders the streetlights
    as fuzz as I walk along concrete turned pitch black by the fumes of a million
    hover strollers. I pass Happy Adrian\u2019s, and on my left is the usual group
    of root suckers sprawled over the steps of the crumbling cathedral that houses
    their organization.\n\nAdrian Moncel, their lord and master, founded their quasi-religion
    half a year ago, based on the mystical properties of a hallucinogenic root that
    grows in the mountains west of the city. Soon enough he\u2019d gathered a following
    through shiny promises, all the usual: spiritual enlightenment, freedom from earthly
    constraints, a One True Path to follow. Of course, all they ever do is sit around
    and chew on their root. Occasionally one of them will wander off the cathedral
    grounds and get hit by something fast moving. They\u2019re easily recognizable
    by their tilting heads and beatific smiles, their teeth stained the dark green
    of ancient mint. I briefly toyed with joining them once, but there was just so
    much going on that week.\n\n\\***\n\nWhen I step into the foyer of UoC 3-18-8,
    the small building that houses the University of Caille\u2019s Peregrix subcampus,
    that familiar antiseptic nanodrone smell creeps into my nostrils. I make my way
    to chamber 12, shoes scraping over tattered linoleum, and I plant myself in one
    of the seats. The class is underway already, but no one pays me much heed as I
    slink inside.\n\nToday\u2019s module is federation history. Yesterday\u2019s was\ncommon
    robotics. Tomorrow\u2019s will be something else, I forget. Maybe hydrostatics,
    maybe interstellar law. I like variety. Variety keeps me sane. Thank goodness
    the UoC lets us study whatever we want. None of this mandated degree stuff, this
    packaged crap you get with all the other colleges. I\u2019m pretty sure this is
    why the UoC is the foremost educational institution in our dear old federation.\n\nSo
    I learn a number of things about how Caille became the cornerstone of civilization
    in the days of the Garoun Empire. How we invented methods of paper production
    unrivaled anywhere else at the time. How the Garounians were so fascinated by
    our culture that they didn\u2019t so much conquer us as copy us. How the city\u2019s
    location made it a port of call for refugees and immigrants from absolutely everywhere.
    I already know all this, but I learn it again, and I love my city more than ever.\n\nBack
    on the street. The rain is pounding down now. Colors, signs, pictures, madness
    everywhere. A garishly colored Alhoiur hound, limbs malfunctioning, beckons me
    into a crummy arcade-slash-brothel-slash-gift shop. A gigantic hologram from Quafe
    Company Ltd. displays an animated narrative of what my life will be like if I
    switch to Ultra. Commercial choirs scream from swirling rooftops. Consciousness
    blinks in the artificial twilight. Masterless robots dance for change. My attention
    yields to the highest bidder.\n\nSomeone bumps my shoulder, muttering an obscenity
    in an Intaki dialect. Probably thinks I\u2019m just your flat-variety homebred,
    inwardly looking down on the \u2019Takis while outwardly preaching lofty principles
    of tolerance for all. I feel a sudden violent urge to tell him how deeply that\u2019s
    not the case; how I lived with an Intaki family back when the exchange program
    was still viable, how I skydived off the cliffs of his home world surrounded by
    my \u2019Taki friends, how the Idama\u2019s words resounded in my mind when I
    read them under a maroon Poitot dome. By the time the sentence forms he\u2019s
    vanished, though\u2014an angry shadow passing into the electric night.\n\nI feel
    uneasy about it, so I instruct my pad to play me a speech from one of the Idama\u2019s
    disciples, whose name I forget because at the time I recorded it I was on the
    tenth hour of a superhealthy drop variant that was making the rounds last year.\n\nA
    heavily Intaki-inflected voice fills my ears. \u201CExperience is best defined
    by internal stimuli rather than external. Internal stimuli should be used as a
    ground for the vagaries of the outside to sit upon and be contextualized, rather
    than as a hammer to smash against that which you cannot control.\n\nNever let
    external stimuli overtake innate feeling. Let perception and instinct roam free
    in the grasslands of your mind, never colliding but always working together.\u201D
    The clip ends, the voice vanishes, and I\u2019m comforted again, just like always.
    Every time I hear that speech I get a touch of that deep assurance\u2014that insight,
    right\u2014and suddenly I feel as if I know where everything\u2019s going. I mean,
    everything\u2019s going somewhere, right?\n\nI swim through the shining lights,
    past these avenues of hope and disgust, past junkies and artists, past happy and
    disaffected and everywhere in between, and I arrive at my circle\u2019s current
    joint, the Scalding Blue. Its outside decorated only with a constantly shifting,
    red-blue holographic swirl that circumscribes the oval-shaped doorway, the Blue
    is home to the freakiest of the freaks, the extremists of a land where everyone
    is an extremist. The second I pass the doorway, I\u2019m greeted with the musical
    cheers reserved for only a very particular kind of victor over life. Oh, they
    love me in here. I\u2019ve tried it all.\n\nThere they are, my beautiful posse.
    Drunkards and daredevils, lowlifes and libertines, every single aspect of human
    being you could ever wish for taken to the limit, all of them huddled together
    in a smoke-filled space, feeling the thunderous city vibrate around them.\n\nMidway
    through our festivities, I start to kind of feel it again. More shadows. I don\u2019t
    want to have an episode right here\u2014 they hate it when I have an episode\u2014so
    I slink off into the bathroom, sit there shaking for forty minutes, have the whole
    utter-panic-combined-with-splitting-headache combo, bang my head against the stall,
    almost have some people bust in on me thinking I\u2019m two guys beating each
    other up when really I\u2019m one guy beating himself up. And then, just as quickly
    as it began, it\u2019s over. And I\u2019m myself again. I splash my face, I look
    at myself in the mirror and utter a small Intaki affirmation, and then I dance
    confidently on out to my seasoned friends, pretending that what just happened
    was nothing but another part of the plan.\n\nBeyond the wall it breathes, this
    endless emerald city.\n\n\\***\n\nSo we\u2019ve been there sixty, ninety minutes,
    I don\u2019t know. Liquids have been poured, truths have been spilled. And all
    of a sudden I see this fella by the bar, and he\u2019s really the different sort.
    I mean, we get Civires in here every once in a while, quietly huffing and puffing,
    thinking they\u2019re being very subtle about how goddamned superior they feel,
    and they\u2019re always a good source of amusement. This guy, though. This guy\u2019s
    different. There\u2019s a . . . I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019d call it.
    Nobility? Nah. Dignity, maybe. Dignity mixed with something else. I don\u2019t
    know if I\u2019ve ever actually seen this particular characteristic in any living
    person.\n\nAnyway, whatever it is, it surrounds the guy like an aura, right, so
    being in my mildly skewed state and thirsting for a totally new experience, I
    grab my drink and head on over. He doesn\u2019t acknowledge me as I sidle up next
    to him, but from the very first moment there\u2019s never a doubt in my mind that
    he knows I\u2019m there. I don\u2019t know if he moved his shoulders slightly
    or what it was, but from the moment my arm touches the bar counter, it\u2019s
    perfectly clear to me that he not only knows I\u2019m there, but that he probably
    has something of an idea of who I am and even why I came over.\n\nI give it the
    requisite tactical three seconds. Then, in my best conversational, easy-for-foreigners-to-understand
    tone, I go:\n\n\u201CNew in the Emerald?\u201D\n\n\u201CSure,\u201D he answers.\n\n\u201CCame
    to the right place, man! Want to see the Caille dance for all it is, Blue\u2019s
    the joint.\u201D\n\nHe\u2019s noncommittal. \u201CI\u2019ve been here a while,\u201D
    he says. \u201CNice place.\u201D I can\u2019t tell if there\u2019s a toying insult
    in that last bit, but I completely ignore the possibility anyway, because that\u2019s
    just the way we do it here.\n\n\u201CSo, uh . . . what brings you over to our
    little city?\u201D\n\nHe casts me a sidelong glance. In my mind, I see it as a
    gesture of disappointment, like he\u2019s expecting more from me somehow. Not
    really sure what he expects; we\u2019re all just partying, anyway, and he must
    be able to guess that I\u2019m tolerant. I mean, I\u2019m from here.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m
    a musician. I\u2019m on tour with some people,\u201D he says.\n\n\u201COh, really?
    What\u2019s your thing?\u201D My curiosity is piqued. What kind of instrument
    does a fellow like this play?\n\n\u201CI play the suraiiko,\u201D he says.\n\nI
    go a bit crazy. I mean, suraiiko playing is absolutely the most mind-thrashingly
    difficult thing you can do; the amount of training suraikanists go through just
    to be able to play that little drum properly is nothing short of insane. If you\u2019re
    ever lucky enough to meet one, you just have to pick their brains.\n\n\u201CSuraiiko?!
    Damn! Let me buy you a drink!\u201D I do so. Then I proceed, over the course of
    the next fifteen minutes, to question him in what I can only consider, in retrospect,
    to be a completely banal, novice way of questioning someone who knows far more
    than you do about the subject in question. I am vaguely conscious of this throughout
    the conversation, but I willfully wrest out absolutely all of my charm, and at
    points it almost feels as if I succeed, almost feels as if I\u2019ve made some
    connection. \n\nThere\u2019s always that distance with him, though, this dry wind
    blowing through our conversation, chilling our discourse so that nothing we say
    can reach any level of friendly warmth. No surprises there, though. I don\u2019t
    think I\u2019ve ever personally met a Civire who doesn\u2019t have that element.
    And I\u2019ve totally met over ten of them. I\u2019m not sure what it is. They\u2019re
    always a step apart from you, and I don\u2019t even know in what direction. I
    just can\u2019t figure it.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes in, as he\u2019s telling me
    about the philosophical underpinnings of suraiiko rhythms and the regimented discipline
    required to play them properly, I feel a sudden powerful sympathy for his plight,
    and feeling that maybe we\u2019re having a real conversation at last, I blurt
    out:\n\n\u201CIsn\u2019t that so stifling, though?\u201D\n\nHe stops talking and
    raises his eyebrows. His eyes don\u2019t move from his glass.\n\n\u201CDon\u2019t
    you wanna keep some options open?\u201D I continue. \u201CBe able to go different
    places and do different things? I mean, how do you know you\u2019re not missing
    something somewhere else right at this very moment? How can you limit yourself
    from the rest of all this wonderful madness?\u201D\n\nHe looks straight forward
    at the back bar for a few seconds, like he\u2019s pondering whether to reply or
    not. Then he finishes his drink. Staring into his empty glass, he says:\n\n\u201CChoosing
    a single road doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not free to move around within that
    road. It just means you know what you\u2019re doing and where you\u2019re going,
    and that you can make a difference within the sphere you choose.\u201D\n\n\u201CYeah,\u201D
    I say, \u201Cbut there\u2019s so many things to do. Things to see, things to explore,
    things to teach people.\u201D\n\nFor the first time since I started the conversation,
    he looks me dead in the eye. In his gaze are steel jackhammers, quiet vengeance,
    a hundred thousand orbital bombs frozen in still life.\n\n\u201CIf the water stopped
    at every fork,\u201D he says, \u201Chow would the river flow?\u201D\n\nI laugh.
    I look at him and I\u2019m gonna say something really clever but somehow nothing
    comes out. For lack of something better to do, I laugh again.\n\nHe\u2019s back
    to looking at his glass.\n\n\\***\n\nI buy him a final drink, I shake his hand,
    and I make my way back to my table. I mean, it was a good conversation, interesting
    fellow and all . . . but I have friends to attend to, and anyway I\u2019m kind
    of starting to feel those shadows again.\n"
