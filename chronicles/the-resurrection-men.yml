    the time the beatings stopped, Rokan was barely even aware of what was happening.
    There had been rising increments of sharp pain, delivered to his ribs and his
    legs and his hands and his head, and then there was suddenly nothing but the dull,
    hazy, red-rimmed awareness of excruciating aches all over, fighting for their
    share of attention from his fading consciousness.\n\nIt was so late at night that
    even if he had dared to take his hands from his face, he wouldn't have been able
    to see. All he heard was the sounds, like slabs of meat being bashed by rocks.\n\nHe
    lay there, hunched in on himself. In the part of his mind that had gone very cold
    and analytical, he was amazed to find that he was unable to move. Also, he was
    lying in a small puddle of water, so he should have been freezing, but his body
    felt numbly warm.\n\nDaring the world to poke and stab, he cracked open one eye,
    then the other.\n\nIt was hardly worth it. He was in the same alley as before,
    with his back to its mouth and his face to the wall. He saw light glinting off
    the puddle he was lying in.\n\nSomeone took a few steps behind him. The glint
    of light was blocked out.\n\nA deep, raspy voice said, \"I believe this is our
    man, Mister B.\"\n\nA rather lighter and softer voice said, \"I do believe you
    are correct, Mister H.\"\n\n\"Shall I hoist?\"\n\n\"If you would be so kind.\"\n\nRokan
    was lifted up with such strength that it was as if he were weightless. Maybe he
    wasn't paralyzed, he stupidly thought; maybe he had simply died back there and
    these were the collectors who'd come for his remains.\n\nBut his body was hauled
    out of the alley - one of his captors said, \"Look sharp now, young man, you're
    out of harm's way\" - and set inside a hovercar that pulled up and hummed quietly.
    Everything hummed quietly, inside Rokan's head.\n\nComing in right after and taking
    their seats opposite him were two men in dark coats and hats, each at least a
    decade older than Rokan. Their faces betrayed no expression: They were neither
    cold nor confrontative but simply, Rokan assumed, at ease with who they were and
    with the purpose of what they were doing.\n\nThe warm numbness started to fade,
    and he gingerly tried to stretch his arms and legs. They obeyed, if creakingly.
    So he wasn't paralyzed. It must, he reasoned, simply have been the fear.\n\nThe
    two men did not look as if they were inclined to speak, and the windows were shaded
    so dark that Rokan couldn't see out, so his attention naturally turned to himself.
    He gingerly felt his face. His lower lip was busted, and one of his eyes felt
    swollen up.\n\nThe men apparently noticed this, because B regarded him for a moment,
    then reached into a pocket and handed him something. \"Here. Put this on you,
    son.\"\n\nRokan accepted the thing. He regarded it with careful interest. It was
    a small round patch, sheer but with faint lines crisscrossing it like a gossamer
    web.\n\n\"It's a cure,\" B said. \"Electrodes will cool down the swelling, and
    the silk they're embedded in will stick to your rather broken skin without harming
    it any further.\"\n\nRokan nodded his thanks. He peeled off the patch's protective
    skin and gingerly placed it on his face, as near the swollen part as he could
    tell. It felt nicely cool.\n\nThere was a slight bump on the drive and he winced,
    but his face didn't throb as much as he'd expected it to.\n\n\"Where are we going?\"
    he asked them.\n\n\"We'll be there soon,\" the other man, Mister H, told him in
    a dulcet voice.\n\nRokan shifted in his seat, which made little lines of fire
    crackle throughout his body like veins in a lava outflow. He could move, though,
    and no bones seemed to be broken. He wondered if he could bolt from the hovercar
    - they were clearly keeping to low speeds - but decided not to take that thought
    any further. Whoever these men were, they had saved him from a terrible fate.\n\nProbably.\n\n\"Look,
    I don't want to sound ungrateful,\" he said. The two men regarded him with something
    resembling faint amusement. \"But am I in even more trouble than I was before?\"\n\n\"Lying
    in the street, being kicked to death by hooligans?\" H asked him.\n\nRokan gave
    an awkward grin, feeling the skin on his face tear just a tiny bit. \"They're,
    uh. They're maybe a bit more than that.\"\n\nH seemed unconcerned. \"You have
    talents, young man. They got you into trouble, and we aim to have them get you
    out.\"\n\nRokan closed his eyes and sighed. \"Talents. So you know why they were
    after me.\"\n\n\"Of course we do,\" B said, quite jovially.\n\n\"I am not going
    to work for you.\" He opened his eyes again and gave them what he hoped was a
    defiant stare, though its effects were somewhat spoiled by the need to keep looking
    from one to the other. \"I needed to get into that vault, and I tried, and I failed,
    and they were probably going to kill me for it.\"\n\nB made a tch sound. \"These
    people were amateurs who were going to beat you to a pulp. We really cannot abide
    that sort of behaviour.\" He leaned in. \"We have a proper use in mind for you,
    young sir.\"\n\n\"Look ... you know what it is I do,\" Rokan protested.\n\n\"You
    break into secure places,\" H said. He had not leaned in but was sitting upright;
    in fact, to the best of Rokan's recollection, he not moved during the entire trip.\n\n\"I
    don't break into them. I just...\" He shrugged. \"I undo the locks.\"\n\n\"That
    place you were trying to 'undo' had some quite powerful, time-sensitive safeguards.
    Ones that are usually bypassed only by very complicated - and very expensive -
    AI procedures,\" H said.\n\n\"Those aren't that big a deal,\" Rokan said.\n\nThey
    raised their eyebrows at him; not in admiration, he suspected, but rather in genuine
    surprise.\n\n\"Of course\" \u2013 he rubbed his bruises \u2013 \"I didn't know
    about their backup systems. Or how quick the guards would come.\"\n\n\"You're
    pretty good at this kind of thing,\" B said.\n\n\"When I'm not getting beaten
    to shit? Yeah, I rather think I am,\" Rokan told them.\n\nThe car glided to a
    stop. They stepped out, Rokan waving off the offered support from his two rescuers
    and gingerly finding his feet on solid ground. They were in some manner of underground
    parking complex, cars all around them at regular intervals. Rokan had no idea
    where they could be. The walls were metal and opaque plastic.\n\n\"This way, please,
    sir,\" B told him, raising an arm in guidance down one of the marked walking lanes
    beside the cars. \"Mind you keep to the path, now. Some of the vehicles come fairly
    roaring in here, and we don't want to put you at risk.\"\n\nThey led him out,
    up a series of steps that led to a door. B arrived first and quietly stood in
    front of it. There was a hiss, then an extended pause, followed by a click as
    the door unlocked.\n\n\"Scanners?\" Rokan asked.\n\n\"Cellular. Gaseous form,\"
    H told him.\n\n\"Seriously? Why not ocular, or DNA?\"\n\n\"Those rely on body
    parts,\" H said. \"Can't trust them.\"\n\nThey walked through the door, down a
    well-lit corridor that led them to other well-lit corridors. Eventually they went
    into a room that Rokan half expected to be terribly uncomfortable, like an interrogation
    chamber or a prison cell.\n\nIt wasn't. It was smaller than he'd expected, and
    outfitted with a carpet on which stood three faux-leather chairs. Two of them
    were side by side, facing the third. Beside that one was a small machine, a square
    block with dials and screens, on top of which lay variously coloured patches similar
    to the ones he'd received in the car. The machine put Rokan in mind of the world's
    first robot. The lighting in the room was pleasant, originating part from a large
    semitranslucent bulb in the ceiling, and part from standing lamps located in each
    corner. There were pictures on the walls.\n\n\"You can be at ease, sir. We only
    want to engage your services,\" B told him.\n\nHe sat, and the chair quietly moulded
    itself to him. After the beating, and after the tension of the drive - where,
    he now realized, he had been scared rigid even though the seats had been quite
    comfy - he felt the tension at last seep out of him, as if he were a dirigible
    stretched full of air that had been pricked with the tiniest of holes.\n\n\"We
    want you to put these on,\" H said, indicating the patches. \"They will feel a
    little ... grippy, maybe a little sticky for a moment.\"\n\nHe hesitated, so B
    added, \"Oh, don't worry, sir, we'll turn our backs.\u201D\n\n\"Where do I stick
    them?\" he asked.\n\n\"Anywhere you like. They'll inject some things that can
    move around on their own.\"\n\nHe leaned forward and gingerly pulled off his shirt,
    wincing when he saw the muddy streaks of blood on one side, where he'd been cut,
    and the red welts on the other, where he'd been repeatedly kicked. As he applied
    the patches he found they stuck pretty well the moment they touched his skin.
    They adapted to his skin in a manner he didn't understand; after a little while
    he could barely see they were there.\n\nB handed him a dry new shirt. He pulled
    it on and gave a pleasurable little sigh when he smelled its freshness.\n\n\"Who
    do you work for?\" he asked them.\n\nH, who was checking the machine, looked at
    him briefly and said, \"A capsuleer,\" then returned to tuning the machine's dials.\n\nThe
    word raised such dread in Rokan that he felt as if electricity had been shot into
    his heart, doubling its beats and crackling out through his veins until it reached
    the skin of his fingertips. He gasped for air.\n\n\"Steady, now!\" H said, raising
    an open hand with palm out either in placation or warning.\n\nHe took a deep breath.
    Whatever this was, it was bigger than he could probably handle.\n\nB regarded
    him amiably. \"Would you like something to drink?\" he asked.\n\nRokan realized
    his throat was parched. \"Yes, please,\" he croaked.\n\nB left the room for a
    moment, then came back with a glass of water. Rokan drank it down. It was wonderfully
    cold.\n\nHe looked at the machine, which H had finished tuning. It was silent,
    but several of its monitors displayed ever-changing figures. \"Do I have to ...
    I mean, what do I have to do?\"\n\nH said, \"Nothing very much. At least not right
    away. We're just measuring some of your basic abilities. Do you feel anything?\"\n\nHe
    sat there quietly, checking for itching, strange bumps, odd internal pokes, or
    anything he might not be imagining. The two men took their seats opposite to him
    and waited.\n\nAfter a while he took in another deep breath and sank a little
    further into the chair, letting the backwash of adrenaline envelop him. It really
    was very comfortable here.\n\n\"No. Nothing much at all.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"So
    am I going to be working for this man?\" He checked himself. \"Is it even a man?\"\n\nThey
    nodded. \"You could be very useful to him, and to others of his kind,\" H said.\n\nHe
    opened his mouth to speak, but hesitated. From the looks they gave him he was
    sure they knew what he wanted to ask, but he tried to say it out loud nonetheless
    - for some reason it was important to him to ask how he could be useful, to take
    charge of his own usefulness - but his throat was parched again and all that came
    out was a croak.\n\n\"We are measuring your ability to handle certain types of
    stimuli,\" B said, pouring him another glass of water from a transparent can.
    Rokan couldn't even remember him having left the room to get the can. B continued,
    \"The tests shouldn't reach you at a conscious, perceivable level, at least not
    the kind we're doing right now.\"\n\n\"So what are they for? Is this a health
    check before I go on board?\" Just the words go on board gave him a nice, warm
    little sense of freedom. He found that he didn't care much about what he'd have
    to do. He'd be away from here; on a spaceship, out in the darkness. What an adventure.\n\nB
    gave H a look, who said, \"It's a check, yes. We want to see if your brain can
    handle the pressure.\n\nHe liked their funny speech, and the odd way they emphasized
    things. \"Like a capsuleer,\" he said. He really felt very cozy. \"Can I have
    something more to drink?\"\n\nB filled his glass while H continued, \"Yes, precisely
    so. Capsuleers interface with modules in very much the same way that we're having
    your body do now, albeit at a much simplified level.\"\n\nRokan drained his glass
    in two gulps. A question popped into his mind, one that he'd never have thought
    - or probably dared - to ask.\n\n\"Why isn't everyone able to be a capsuleer?
    If I've got talents...\" He left the second question unasked, his voice trailing
    off.\n\nB said, \"Well, not everyone has the constitution. Capsuleering isn't
    just sitting in a pod. It's a thoroughly complex interaction of many different
    elements, mechanical and biological, that converge inside a person's body.\"\n\nH
    added, again with that weird emphasis, that certain sections of the brainwere
    capable of dealing well with certain parts of that interaction. \"It isn't quite
    understood how they work, but we're constantly researching it. Sometimes we find
    out how certain ship modules can be better adapted to the capsuleers, so that
    their output or function can be improved. But it's hard.\"\n\n\"I can imagine.
    Must be ... complex,\" Rokan said.\n\n\"Not so much, but it's a difficult bit
    of ...\" H waved a hand, apparently looking for the term. \"Reverse engineering.\"\n\nRokan
    started to say something, but H plunged on. \"There are a million ways to adjust
    the modules. We're just not always aware of exactly how they should be adjusted.
    First we need to find a brain that's capable of operating at better capacity than
    hereto identified, and then we know in what direction to take the technology.\"\n\n\"Are
    these huge changes?\"\n\n\"To be honest, they don't look that grand on paper.
    Maybe some piece of equipment, some module in a spaceship, raises its output by
    five percent. But that alone can make a huge difference in interstellar combat.
    It may turn the tide of entire battles.\"\n\n\"So you need candidates like me,\"
    Rokan said.\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"Am I going to get to meet the capsuleer?\"\n\nB
    and H looked at each other again. B said, \"Mmm ... I suppose that isn't out of
    the question.\"\n\nRokan thought all this over. \"That's awesome,\" he managed.
    The three of them sat in silence for a moment before he found himself bound to
    add, \"I mean, I'll be happy to help you with your research.\"\n\n\" I know you
    will,\" B said, quite genially.\n\n\"But guys, I'm feeling really tired right
    now. Could we ... sorry.\" He leaned forward and rubbed his eyes. \"Could we take
    a break?\"\n\nThe fuzziness in his head was overwhelming. It felt as if the lights
    had been dimmed; and things glinted: the machine, the chair legs, the teeth of
    Mister B and Mister H, who were giving him big, benevolent smiles.\n\n\"Oh, it's
    alright,\" they said. \"Rest now.\"\n\nThe room really was rather dark.\n\n\"Rest.\"
