    the Jovians introduced capsule technology to the empires several methods have
    been tried out regarding the visual presentation of the surroundings to the captain
    enclosed in his capsule. The first method tried, and the one the Jovians first
    used (and sometimes still do), was to use the data from wide range of scanners
    to paint a realistic view of the ship\u2019s surroundings in the mind of the captain.
    But after intensive experimentations it was discovered that this caused severe
    nausea and disorientation for most captains not of Jove origin. Other high-tech
    methods also had to be discarded for the same or similar reasons. In the end,
    the empires discovered that simple cameras directly connected to small screens
    inside the captain\u2019s helmet were the best solution. At first these cameras
    were mounted on the hull of the ship, but with the advent of electrical energy
    weapons these cameras became too vulnerable to damage from electrical charges.\n\nThe
    Gallenteans were the first to experiment with cameras mounted on drones hovering
    around the ship. They first developed this method when researching more efficient
    point-defense weapons. This hovering method later caught on with the other races
    and is now common practice, with all the empires manufacturing their own types
    of camera drones, all based on the same principle. At first only one camera drone
    was used, but today they are two, for stereoscopic vision. The camera drones are
    suspended some distance from the ship. They attach to the ship by using a combination
    of an attractive magnetic force and repulsive electromechanical force, this also
    allows them to orbit the ship at any desired position. This means that the drones
    never need replenishing or refueling.\n\nThe camera drone can be commanded through
    the captain\u2019s neural link. This gives the captain tremendous ability to get
    a clear view of his environment in a quick and comprehensive manner. By stationing
    the camera drone some distance from the ship the drone is not as susceptible to
    weapon outbursts hitting the ship\u2019s hull. The drone can still be destroyed,
    either by accident, such as passing debris or stray shot, or on purpose. All ships
    have abundant supplies of spare camera drones stored away for such occasions and
    the captain has to be fairly clueless to run out of camera drones. The fact that
    the drones are stationed outside the ship\u2019s shield makes it impractical to
    try to protect them. Simply storing lots and lots of them is much easier, as they\u2019re
    very cheap.\n\nWhen the ship uses a stargate the camera drone needs to move back
    into the ship when jumping. It re-emerges as soon as the ship exits the jump.
    This does not apply to warping, when the ship travels between planets within a
    solar system.\n\nAlthough the camera drone serves as the main visual tool of the
    captain cameras have been used in more ways. Some missiles sport a camera in their
    nose, allowing the captain to see directly where the missile lands."
