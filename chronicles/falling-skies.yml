    Standard Time<br>\nMarch 22nd, YC115<br>\nVillore VII \u2013 Moon 6 - Senate Bureau<br>\nVieres
    Constellation, Gallente Federation</p>\n\nA tangle of voices echoed around the
    cavernous interior of the Senate chamber as the last group filed out through the
    main entrance, an uncountable number of dialects and accents slowly replaced with
    a stony silence.\n\nHis eyes remained downcast, his field of view filled with
    holofeeds from every corner of the besieged planet. To his right, closed circuit
    footage showed the glossy black surface of the Shintoko Tower, one of Arcurio\u2019s
    most well-known landmarks, folding like a house of cards. Its lights flickered
    out like a thousand candles caught in the breeze as it toppled into two neighboring
    structures.\n\nDirectly in front of him, a burning armored personnel carrier emblazoned
    with the markings of the Caldari Providence Directorate crashed to a halt, slamming
    into parked vehicles in a crowded street littered with smoldering debris. A figure
    emerged as the hatch was thrown open, more of a shadow behind the glow of immolation
    than anything identifiably human. It battled against the heat, frantically attempting
    to flee the superheated wreckage. Upon doing so it was kicked and beaten into
    a lifeless burning heap by a bloodthirsty crowd.\n\nHis eyes moved on, head still
    downcast. An ocean of protestors with all manner of homemade weapons filled a
    broad, tree lined avenue in downtown Pakuri. A young woman no more than 20 years
    of age, holding the fluttering flag of the Gallente Federation, crumpled to the
    asphalt as a canister of riot control gas struck her sternum. She remained inanimate
    as the crowd surged over her toward the Provist blockade.\n\nThe sound of a quiet,
    smooth voice dragged his eyes from the carnage. \u201CMister President. I need
    a decision as soon as you\u2019re ready. Our forces are on standby.\u201D\n\nHe
    nodded his hairless head, his eyes returning to the mess of holographic images
    projected beneath the immaculate glass surface of the desk. He picked out the
    face of a handsome young Gallente man, sullied features locked in a scowl, lips
    moving in silent protest. Without looking up, he replied:\n\n\u201CAnd then what?
    If I give the green light, what happens next? This operation is a massive risk.
    If it fails, you know what Heth will do. It would be the biggest mistake of my
    life to think he wouldn't burn every shred of Gallente existence from Caldari
    Prime.\u201D\n\nBlaque approached him slowly as his words echoed around the empty
    chamber and his hand gestured to the carnage laid out on the surface of the desk.
    \u201COur people are dying on the ground. We can\u2019t wait any longer. Whether
    he orders the Shiigeru to strike an hour or a year from now, so long as it stays
    in orbit and our citizens down there persist in causing unrest, it will remain
    a clear threat to the security of Luminaire. Heth\u2019s reaction is something
    we can never fully prepare for.\u201D\n\n\u201CDon\u2019t lecture me, Mentas.
    I\u2019m well aware of the situation. If the administration at the time hadn't
    been so damned spineless, we wouldn\u2019t be in this position now\u201D was the
    calm, quiet reply.\n\nBlaque couldn\u2019t help but allow himself a small smile
    as he watched Jacus Roden, President of the Gallente Federation, drum the fingertips
    of his right hand against the laminated surface of the desk. The older man let
    his eyes settle once more on the collage of destruction projected beneath his
    hand.\n\nA low-slung, sleek white vehicle stood waiting at the black and yellow
    striped barrier of a Provist checkpoint. Roden ran the tips of his fingers over
    the grainy image of a Caldari Providence Directorate soldier, his rifle stood
    at his side as he stooped over to speak through the open window of the vehicle.
    A second later his neck snapped back, his head erupting in a crimson haze.\n\nThe
    rear wheels of the vehicle bounced over the tangled body, its nose pushing through
    the barrier and its bodywork riddled by small arms fire. Roden watched as a perfectly
    straight contrail of smoke extended from the guardhouse of the checkpoint like
    a bold line drawn across a sheet of paper. The detonation of the \u2018Foxfire\u2019
    anti-personnel rocket tossed the vehicle through a tail over nose flip into a
    roadside drainage ditch, leaving a trail of fire and billowing black smoke in
    its wake.\n\n\u201CThe situation is spiraling out of control down there. The Provists
    are losing grip and each hour we delay, we lose more lives to their heavy-handed
    action.\u201D Blaque\u2019s words were carefully delivered as he fixed his gaze
    on the top of Roden\u2019s smooth-skinned head. \u201CWe need to make sure that
    the option to call in an orbital strike at the hands of Admiral Yanala is taken
    out of the equation.\u201D\n\nRoden pulled his attention from the charred remains
    of the vehicle as the Provists began to flank it in well-trained cover formation.
    He met the sharp amber gaze of Blaque. \u201CI've seen enough. How long would
    we have to wait for a full deployment?\u201D\n\n\u201CThe Navy can move as soon
    as they have approval, but the FEDCAFT story we pushed to the media will only
    hold for so long. Sooner or later they\u2019ll expect our forces to return to
    headquarters.\u201D As Blaque finished the sentence, his eyes washed over the
    mess of video feeds in front of the President.\n\n\u201CRanchel is confident that
    our forces can pull this off?\u201D Roden\u2019s tone was inquisitive, with a
    measure of wariness, his attention turning to Blaque across the desk. Blaque nodded
    in response.\n\n\u201CHe has Admiral Bauvon in command of the strike force, over
    a thousand vessels at his disposal if needed. It will be a surprise offensive.
    We\u2019ve been monitoring Caldari Navy communications in Black Rise. At present
    they believe that if we\u2019re going to attack, we'll do so with a full-scale
    offensive against the State, rather than just Caldari Prime. The FIO has solid
    intelligence on this, and the diversion has worked. Phase one is complete, phase
    two needs nothing but your authorization.\u201D\n\nRoden rested his elbows on
    the surface of the desk, balling one hand into a fist, the second clasped around
    it as a rest for his chin. \u201CAnd how do they predict that this will play out?\u201D\n\n\u201CThe
    Caldari Navy already has forces primed to jump to Luminaire should our cynosural
    inhibitor network be compromised. They\u2019re always on standby. When we bring
    the net down, they\u2019re liable to jump through at least a token reactionary
    force, but nothing we won\u2019t be able to clean up given time and commitment.
    The main unknown factor is always going to be the behavior of capsuleers. If they
    realize what\u2019s happening, they may see this as an offensive to take back
    Caldari Prime.\u201D\n\nRoden let out a slow sigh, his fingers gently rubbing
    over his clean-shaven chin. \u201CThey will soon realize that this is not the
    objective of the operation. Until then, our forces will have to deal with them
    as appropriate.\u201D\n\n\u201CFrankly, for all I care, the State can keep that
    godforsaken icy rock. As for the Shiigeru, we can no longer tolerate its presence.\u201D
    Blaque\u2019s reply was without hesitation, a pause only for breath interrupting
    him. \u201CIt now presents an undeniable threat to the security of the Federation,
    and should never have been agreed upon after the invasion.\u201D\n\nPresident
    Roden gave a gentle nod of agreement. The words of his next sentence were delivered
    as if part of a speech, each one selected, analyzed thoroughly and approved before
    being spoken. \u201CThis operation will cost lives on both sides. The only saving
    grace is that the number of Federal casualties will be far lower if we act now
    instead of allowing Provist forces to unleash the full force of the Shiigeru on
    our people. You have my authorization for phase two.\u201D\n\nThe response from
    Blaque was immediate, a hand thrust between the buttons of his crisp olive-colored
    jacket. He withdrew a sleek black datapad from his breast pocket and slid it across
    the desk to the President, who offered his thumb to a glowing green square on
    its holographic display. His words were slow and measured. \u201CSee to it that
    it\u2019s done, and keep me updated every ten minutes until the operation is completed,
    regardless of the outcome.\u201D\n\nBlaque nodded in response, catching the device
    as it was slid back to him. \u201CYou have my word that the pilots selected for
    this operation are the finest the Federation Navy has to offer.\u201D The younger
    man slid the small datapad back into his jacket before turning on his heel and
    making for the door. He lifted his fingers to his earpiece as he walked.\n\nRoden\u2019s
    eyes were drawn back to the surface of the desk long enough to watch the aftermath
    at the security checkpoint. Three Provist soldiers carefully wrapped their fallen
    squad member in a large black sheet before carrying him off toward the guardhouse.
    The old man lifted his attention from the collage of holographics in time to see
    the head and shoulders of \n\nMentas Blaque vanish through the side exit of the
    Senate chamber, his last audible words echoing around the large open space.\n\n\u201CRanchel?
    Blaque. Phase two of Operation Highlander is go. Deploy at your discretion.\u201D\n\n---\n\n<p

    Standard Time<br>\nMarch 22nd, YC115<br>\nCaldari Prime \u2013 Outskirts of Arcurio
    \u2013 Altitude 1338 meters</p>\n\n\u201CPrepare for insertion! Six Minutes!\u201D\n\nMajor
    Kuos Askulen sealed the hatch to the cockpit of the Sparrow-class dropship, before
    making a \u2018v\u2019 with his armored fingers as he walked the length of the
    troop compartment\u2019s port side aisle. He double-tapped his cheeks in a gesture
    to his eyes, then pointed to the red light beside the dropship\u2019s rear loading
    ramp, its domed lens illuminating as if on cue. His voice was raised over the
    deafening drone of the craft\u2019s thrusters.\n\n\u201CEquipment check, be prepped
    to give these bastards hell!\u201D\n\nThe dropship bucked violently in a hail
    of anti-aircraft fire, Askulen\u2019s feet momentarily leaving the steel deck
    plating. The nausea of temporary weightlessness churned his stomach before his
    feet made contact again, and when they did, he staggered and bounced sideways,
    his armored form pressing into the lap of one of the seated men from his platoon.
    A muffled voice sounded out from beneath him.\n\n\u201CDamn, Sir, you gotta learn
    to control yourself until we\u2019re off duty.\u201D\n\nAskulen righted himself,
    pressing a large hand down on the soldier\u2019s helmet, deliberately skewing
    it to one side as he stood. He smirked from beneath his \u2018Nightstalker\u2019
    tactical goggles as his retort came amidst a chorus of whistles and shouting.\n\n\u201COnly
    your sister gets that pleasure, and definitely only when I\u2019m off duty. Get
    your shit in line and prepare to deploy.\u201D\n\nHe continued walking, his head
    craning around to watch the platoon of sixty men prepare their equipment. The
    rattle and metallic snap of magazines being inserted into standard-issue Kaalakiota
    R-66A Assault Rifles was a familiar noise that always curled his lips into a smile.
    He reached the rear of the dropship and turned to face those under his command,
    gripping the well-worn framework above his head for support.\n\n\u201COur objective
    is to re-secure the surface-to-orbit defense batteries at the southeast corner
    of District Nine. Our LZ is hot with Federal Defense Union activity, but secure
    for now. We're gonna set up a defensive perimeter, then move northwest to secure
    and man the batteries.\n\n\u201CDo not underestimate our hostiles. Reports indicate
    we\u2019re up against a sizable force of these prototype soldiers that have been
    in the news. You\u2019ve all had the briefing; you know what they\u2019re capable
    of.\u201D\n\nThe professionalism of his unit had always given him a supreme confidence
    in their ability to perform under fire. They were a credit to the Caldari Navy.
    He gave a nod, watching the well-trained squad run through their various pre-deployment
    checks.\n\nHalf way down the portside aisle, Second Lieutenant Oroki Matavo straightened
    out his ballistic helmet, glancing over to the soldier strapped into the seat
    opposite him. He kicked out at the other man\u2019s armored boot to rouse his
    attention, shouting over the drone of the Sparrow\u2019s thrusters.\n\n\u201CHey
    Tsu, you hear that? We\u2019re up against those cloned freaks. We gotta keep the
    squad close-cut, good spacing, hit 'em hard and fast and be prepped to knock out
    their CRU if they keep coming.\u201D\n\nCorporal Yon Tsuata nodded back across
    the aisle in agreement. \u201CWe got a good crew, solid command; we\u2019ll be
    in good shape once we hit the ground. We knock out their infrastructure and they\u2019re
    on the same playing field as we are.\u201D\n\nMatavo shook his head, giving a
    nervous laugh. \u201CI wish I shared your optimism. The stories I\u2019ve heard,
    these things can take a full mag from a 66A and just keep coming. We\u2019re probably
    gonna run short on ammo before we kill enough of them.\u201D\n\nTsuata opened
    his mouth to respond but before he could speak, the wind was knocked out of him
    with a hard metallic thump. He looked across the aisle to see a series of fist-sized
    holes open up along the Sparrow\u2019s fuselage above Matavo's head, long shafts
    of light penetrating the armored hull as sparks bounced around the dropships interior.\n\nHis
    eyes were drawn downward with the realization that the warmth in his lap was coming
    from a hole in his thigh. There was no pain as his eyes followed the path of the
    armor piercing round. It led from a hole in the floor beneath the half of his
    foot and boot that remained, through his seat, then made entry through the back
    of his thigh and exit through its top. He barely had time to register the second
    entry wound below his left pectoral muscle before he lost consciousness.\n\nMatavo\u2019s
    mouth dropped open slightly as the young officer\u2019s lifeless head lolled forward,
    a crimson trail leaking from his lips. Within seconds there was chaos as the troop
    compartment began to fill with thick black smoke. He reached forward, his restraints
    automatically loosening for an emergency drop as a second hail of fire from below
    riddled the side of the dropship, showering sparks and crimson across the floor.
    Matavo let out a shout, grabbing at the edge of what remained of his seat as he
    was pelted with a hail of soldiers and loose equipment.\n\nThe Sparrow banked
    hard to avoid another lethal burst of fire, failing to outmaneuver the lead that
    its aggressor had predicted. Its armored side was shredded in a third hail of
    depleted uranium, a dozen or so men thrown out through a gaping slash in the side
    of the craft. Matavo tightened his grip as the dropship spiraled wildly, flames
    from the port side thruster assembly licking in through the damaged hull.\n\nHe
    looked up as the sound of the co-pilot\u2019s voice thundered through the troop
    compartment\u2019s PA system. The stench of seared flesh almost overwhelmed his
    senses.\n\n\u201CMayday, Mayday, this is Protectorate wing \u2018Dragon\u2019
    two five seven. Port side thrusters knocked out, pilot KIA, zero control, we are
    going down. Repeat, we are going down. All personnel brace for crash landing.\u201D\n\nMatavo
    was thrown across the aisle toward the center of the craft as it banked hard again,
    before falling into a steep dive. He wrapped his arms around one of the structural
    supports, narrowly avoiding a surge of bodies that tumbled toward the front of
    the craft. Those of his unit who were still alive scrambled to brace themselves
    for a hard landing.\n\nHe looked up toward the rear of the dropship as the body
    of Major Askulen rolled past him, and couldn\u2019t help smiling at the irony
    of the red light that suddenly turned green, as if oblivious to the chaos. The
    loading ramp yawned open and spilled personnel and equipment into the trail of
    thick black smoke that followed the craft and through the tangle of debris his
    eyes caught sight of something beautiful in the amber evening sky.\n\nSome 340
    kilometers above, the setting sun refracted off the hull of the Shiigeru. The
    vessel the Sparrow-class had been dispatched from, the bastion of armored Caldari
    steel that had served as his home for the last three years of his deployment.\n\nHe
    watched her sleek hull shimmer behind the heat haze trailing from the crippled
    dropship. Loose crates of equipment and dead members of his platoon tumbled past
    him, thrust out through the rear of the craft by a funnel of air forced in through
    its damaged side.\n\nSeveral more sleek grey hulls streaked into the sky above.
    They were distant, but easily recognizable as the silhouettes of four Wyvern-class
    supercarriers that had joined the Shiigeru. He remained transfixed, and for a
    split second he smiled again, before a blinding white flash removed him from existence.\n\n---\n\n<p

    Standard Time<br>\nMarch 22nd, YC115<br>\nCaldari Prime \u2013 227km south east
    of Arcurio \u2013 District 9</p>\n\nThe well-worn bronze frame of the Boundless
    Creation MH-82 Heavy Machine Gun rubbed against her armored thigh, her boots kicking
    up a trail of dust as she ascended the steep side of the hill. The matte black
    hulls of three Sparrow-class dropships thundered across the evening sky above
    her head. The tactical heads-up display within her dropsuit\u2019s helmet marked
    them with red brackets and provided velocity and altitude readouts as she glanced
    skyward.\n\nOn reaching the summit she drew in a long breath, the coarse rasp
    of the respirator filling her ears. The dropships banked hard toward southern
    Arcurio and passed through a column of thick white smoke, twisting it into a coil
    in their wake. Movement in her peripheral vision drew her attention away from
    the flying machines.\n\nA Saga model light attack vehicle bounced across open
    ground, its unarmored driver and passenger\u2019s heads swaying with the rough
    ride. Their gunner, dressed in the combat uniform of a Provist occupation force
    infantryman, was almost thrown from the vehicle as he attempted to keep a barrage
    of antimatter fire on a pursuing vehicle that was obscured by dust.\n\nShe crouched
    on the crest of the hill, easily supporting the sixty-kilo bulk of the MH-82 in
    her augmented arms. Her heads-up display instantly recognized the target, providing
    its velocity, heading and an estimation of its condition and combat readiness.
    When she pulled the trigger, the weapon roared into life.\n\nQuad rotary barrels
    belched flames three times the length of the weapon, the cloned brain of its operator
    predicting a perfect lead. A maelstrom of dust and dry soil was thrown up around
    the vehicle as it rolled over like a discarded toy, riddled by a hail of depleted
    uranium rounds. \n\nShe pulsed the trigger in two-second bursts to prevent the
    weapon from overheating, stopping only to allow the pursuing friendly vehicle
    to cross her line of fire and vanish over the opposite hill. After another three
    bursts, the rotating barrel gave off a soft whine, spooling down as she spoke
    to the other members of her squad.\n\n\u201CThis is Highlander Two Niner, Unit
    Six. Hostile scout patrol neutralized. Awaiting further orders.\u201D\n\n\u201CAcknowledged,
    Unit Six, resume anti-air support,\u201D was the immediate reply, distorted by
    gunfire.\n\nShe remained crouched, one knee in the dirt as a wing of three more
    Sparrow-class dropships tore across the sky above her head.\n\nFlames jetted from
    the weapon, its aim lifted as a hail of countermeasure flares poured from the
    rear of the dropships. She smirked behind her visor, her heads-up temporarily
    blinded but her brain operating on instinct no mortal soldier could match. A simple
    neural command from her occipital implant magnified her vision instantly, drawing
    the silhouette of her target fifty times closer.\n\nA hail of rounds struck their
    mark, two bursts of fire shredding the snarling painted nose of the lead dropship
    and punching holes in the numbers \u2018257\u2019 along its side. It belched a
    contrail of black smoke and shimmering debris, rolling over and spiraling into
    a steep dive.\n\nShe let loose a third barrage of fire and watched as a trail
    of equipment and infantry poured from the craft, its burning fuselage vanishing
    behind a distant hilltop. Her visor returned to the correct visual plane in time
    for her to witness an angry orange mushroom cloud rise into the air, followed
    by the distant rumble of the dropship\u2019s impact.\n\n---\n\n<p style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:'Shentox';font-weight:500\">\n16:31
    EVE Standard Time<br>\nMarch 22nd, YC115<br>\nCaldari Prime \u2013 171km south
    east of Arcurio \u2013 District 2</p>\n\n\u201CMove! Move! Move! Forward!\u201D\n\nSix
    sets of heavily armored boots pounded the rough ground as the squad advanced.
    Two of the men broke off to the left, rounding the battered side of a reinforced
    concrete silo as First Lieutenant Odaki Tunen\u2019s voice burst into their ears.\n\n\u201CDragon
    257 didn\u2019t make it. We push forward. We can do this.\u201D\n\nAnother pair
    of the State Protectorate soldiers split off from the group, flanking right and
    using two large logistics transports as cover. The young Lieutenant rested his
    armored back against the side of the domed four-story silo, his respirator rasping
    harshly as a voice broke across comms into his helmet. As he listened, those on
    the right flank drew closer to the side of the target building behind the transports.\n\n\u201CThis
    is Imaya. Shiwari and I are in place. Left flank is clear, keep them distracted.\u201D\n\n\u201CPosition
    acknowledged, move forward at your own discretion.\u201D\n\nTunen remained crouched,
    peering around the side of the silo toward the building, its front riddled with
    impact marks from heavy caliber projectile fire. The devastated carcasses of two
    tangled Caldari LAVs littered the asphalt in front of the building. The other
    man in his pair, Corporal Tarawa Oiki, unslung a CBR7 Swarm Launcher from his
    shoulder, flicking the arming switch and bringing the stock up against his collarbone.\n\nLieutenant
    Tunen nodded, bracing the fold-out stock of his Ishukone Assault Submachine Gun
    against his shoulder, its barrel pointed around the wall at the front of the building.
    He let off a hail of rounds toward the front of the building, shredding the concrete
    around two of the closest windows. A split second later secure comms lit up, sending
    his voice flooding into the whole squad's ears.\n\n\u201CCovering fire! Move forward!\u201D\n\nHe
    watched the muzzle flashes in his peripheral vision as the two squad members on
    the right flank opened up with a pair of S-1 Forge Guns. Massive chunks of concrete
    were hurled from the front of the single story building as the first round made
    impact, blasting a hole clean into the building. The second round passed through
    the opening, lighting up the windows from inside with a series of vibrant blue
    flashes.\n\nTunen smiled behind his visor, letting the empty magazine clatter
    to the ground from the grip of his SMG. With a hard metallic click, a replacement
    was slid into the slot in time to hose down the three shell-shocked Federal Marines
    that staggered from the gaping hole in the side of the building.\n\nHis head snapped
    to the left as a rumble from inside the silo caught his attention, the ammunition
    inside it starting to shift.\n\n\u201CThey\u2019re preparing to fire! Left flank,
    advance after swarm!\u201D\n\nCorporal Oiki flicked up the sight of the Swarm
    launcher, bracing his lower body to absorb the recoil and aiming the barrel of
    the weapon around the corner of the silo. With the depression of the trigger,
    a salvo of self-guiding missiles was released. They corkscrewed, following the
    contour of the ground before several of them took a route into the building via
    a shattered window, the rest using the massive hole in the wall. There was silence,
    and then a series of loud reports came from within the building and the rest of
    the windows blew out in a hail of glistening shrapnel.\n\nOiki nodded across the
    open ground to the two soldiers bearing the forge guns. Their spent weapons were
    dropped, replaced in their hands by Ishukone-designed submachine guns. They advanced
    on the building, their black-clad forms slinking between the wreckage that littered
    the front of the building like beads of oil through conduits. They were joined
    by the men from the left flank, vanishing into the smoke that poured from the
    hole in the wall.\n\nA number of muzzle flashes from small arms lit up the windows
    as the men began to systematically clear the building. Screams in both Gallente
    and Caldari echoed out through the frame of the shattered building. Tunen nodded
    to Oiki, following him to the left while using the silos as cover on approach.\n\nAs
    the Lieutenant advanced, something caught his eye. He slowed to a walk, tilting
    his head as dust and sand blew over a matte black form slumped against the back
    of the silo. The gun reports became more distant to him as he reached behind his
    ear, clicking the release for his visor and blinking several times as the bright
    light hit his eyes. He inhaled the dusty air, the first time he\u2019d ever done
    so on his people\u2019s ancestral home world, and rested a titanium-kevlar-covered
    knee on the ground between a pair of lifeless legs.\n\nHis eyes inspected the
    armored form of the State Protectorate officer, his chest plate and helmet having
    taken a full frontal impact from a heavy caliber weapon. He was brought back to
    reality as the sound of the swarm launcher tore through his senses. Oiki\u2019s
    voice filled his ears:\n\n\u201CSir, we have to advance. Let\u2019s move. Building
    is clear.\u201D\n\nThe Lieutenant nodded, even though his Corporal was out of
    sight. He replied without hesitation.\n\n\u201CSquad, sound off.\u201D\n\n\u201CClear!\u201D
    were the five responses in quick succession.\n\nTunen was mesmerized for a few
    seconds more as he looked into his own eyes. It was the first time he\u2019d ever
    seen himself dead. His vacant, dust-covered features were visible through his
    shattered visor, identical but lifeless eyes staring back at him.\n\nHe rifled
    through his own corpse\u2019s equipment, snatching up a belt of M1 Locus grenades
    and a Cerberus CRG-3 shotgun before standing. In a macabre gesture he winked,
    then smirked at himself, before making his way around the side of the silo to
    link up with his squad.\n\n---"

    Standard Time<br>\nMarch 22nd, YC115<br>\nCaldari Prime \u2013 291km north of
    Arcurio \u2013 District 11</p>\n\n\u201CETA is 5 minutes.\u201D\n\n\u201CAcknowledged,
    we have one HAV left. We have it pinned down, and the driver is hesitant to show
    himself.\u201D\n\nCorporal Vincent Henette adjusted his dropsuit-wrapped frame
    in the gunner\u2019s seat of the ion blaster cannon turret, his heavy foot pressing
    down on the left control pedal to rotate the turret toward the crest of a hill
    in the distance. He spoke in a hushed tone, as if whispering to the crew of the
    Kaalakiota designed Gunnlogi-class heavy attack vehicle he knew was still concealed
    behind the facility\u2019s heavily armored perimeter wall.\n\n\u201CI see you,
    Provist bastards. I got all the time in the world.\u201D\n\nThe heat haze rising
    from behind the perimeter wall was a clear telltale that the vehicle was still
    there. Henette\u2019s visor flipped through several filters. X-ray showed no trace,
    unable to penetrate the barrier. Night vision blinded him with white static. The
    third filter gave a clear image, an infrared overlay detailed enough to show the
    outline of the vehicle\u2019s driver, forward gunner and tail gunner that was
    displayed before his eyes. He nodded his head before the same voice disturbed
    the peaceful quiet inside the gunner\u2019s compartment.\n\n\u201CTwo inbound
    with escort, but they have a big tail. A whole company of State Protectorate infantry.
    \ Prepare for contact!\u201D\n\nHe gripped the two firing handles for the ion
    cannon\u2019s triggers and took a deep breath, his feet ordering the turret to
    swing toward a trench that ran the full length of the perimeter wall. A single
    thought and the visor of his dropsuit pulled the intersection of the trench and
    perimeter wall into close view, just in time for him to witness a group of armored
    bodies slipping beneath the steel surface. They were using the same way that his
    platoon had infiltrated and taken the facility six hours previously.\n\nHe watched
    as six Federal Defense Union scout dropsuits slithered through the half-meter-high
    opening, followed by two hooded figures in black ankle-length trench coats. Henette
    frowned behind his visor, watching the two figures, their faces obscured under
    the lip of their hoods as they kept low and made toward the rest of his squad.\n\n\u201CBreach!
    Breach! They\u2019re coming under the wall!\u201D\n\nInstant reaction, the kind
    that can\u2019t be trained into a soldier, the kind that is the product of cloning
    an individual and biologically linking them to their weapons and dropsuit, ensured
    that the incursion beyond the outer wall was halted immediately.\n\nCorporal Henette
    swung the turret to face the gap as soon as the words filled his ears. He focused,
    locked and fired, all within a fraction of a second, allowing the heavy caliber
    barrel of the blaster above his head to belch a stream of plasma.\n\nThe two men
    who had made it through the opening were vaporized instantly, a cloud of dust
    shielding their demise from the killer. As the area cleared, it became apparent
    that the sheer force of the strike had blocked the hole beneath the wall completely,
    searing the steel together and turning the sandy earth in front of the wall into
    a crater of shattered glass.\n\n\u201CBreach secured, but they\u2019ll be back
    once they regroup.\u201D\n\nHe rotated the turret back to his original quarry
    as a barrage of heavy-caliber fire bounced off the armored side of the gunner\u2019s
    compartment, lining up the sights with the front of the approaching HAV. The entire
    frame of the turret rocked as the barrel above his head spat a trail of blue plasma
    toward the vehicle. Two direct hits destroyed its front left tracks, causing its
    exposed wheels to dig into the soft sandy earth.\n\nThe munitions readout on his
    visor\u2019s heads-up display flashed red, the turret of the HAV rotating to face
    him after it had slid to a sideways stop.\n\u201CShit,\u201D was the only reaction
    that came to mind as he punched the release on the harness. He rolled sideways,
    out through the personnel hatch, falling three meters onto the hard concrete below
    as the Gunnlogi\u2019s railgun obliterated the gunner\u2019s compartment.\n\nThe
    initial realization that he was still on the field rather than awakening in his
    assigned CRU was a complete blur. He looked up at the black night sky, the distant
    green hue of the Verge Vendor nebula cast as the backdrop for an immense orbital
    firefight. The sounds of the battle came to him in muted tones, the massive hulk
    of the Shiigeru shimmering against the blackness as a kaleidoscope of colors detonated
    against her hull.\n\nHis visor refreshed after a rapid self-diagnostics test of
    his suit, a jumble of red and blue brackets indicating vessels above the cloud
    line. Several of the larger hulls were distinguishable by their silhouettes alone;
    three Nyx-class supercarriers to the left, two Wyvern-classes to the right. He
    drew in a deep breath, his ears still ringing inside his helmet before the whole
    area was lit up for a second. He was temporarily blinded by the immense blue flash
    and when it cleared, only a single Wyvern-class remained overhead.\n\nHenette
    turned his head to the side, blinking several times in disbelief. The figure\u2019s
    hood was pulled back, his smooth hairless head pressed against the sight of a
    CreoDron Tactical Swarm Launcher. The second of them, almost an identical copy
    of the first, was loading the launcher. The young corporal lay on his side in
    the dirt, watching them move smoothly and methodically before the launch of the
    weapon brought him back to his senses, and the blast wave whipped up their black
    overcoats.\n\nCommander Reme Vrie\u2019s deep voice boomed through their squad
    comms as the remains of the Gunnlogi were torn apart by the swarm of warheads.\n\n\u201CFire
    One! Fire One! Finish it, and then we advance!\u201D\n\nThe two bald heads nodded
    in unison, the first tossing the depleted launcher into the trench before they
    both followed. Their strong hands then gripped Henette\u2019s ankles, unceremoniously
    dragging him into the trench.\n\nThe first one spoke, his voice quiet and gravelly,
    barely audible as he pulled his hood back over his head. \u201CHe\u2019ll live,
    but we don\u2019t have time for this shit. Let\u2019s move.\u201D\n\nThe second
    nodded in agreement before they made their way toward the end of the trench flanked
    by twelve Federal Defense Union mercenaries. The positioning array for their objective
    was close; a surface-to-orbit strike platform located only a short dash away across
    open ground. Within a few more seconds they were there, Henette loading a series
    of charges into his CreoDron shotgun as a squadron of Wren-class fighters screamed
    across the sky directly above their heads.\n\nHenette's eyes were torn away from
    the weapon as one of the bald men disrobed beside the exposed control interface
    for the array, revealing an almost organic looking black dropsuit that shimmered
    slickly as if wet. The soldier began to watch with intrigue when the other hairless
    figure slipped a wiring harness from within his coat. It almost seemed to come
    alive, shimmering with fiber optic activity as experienced hands connected it
    to one of the access ports beneath the control interface.\n\nAnother huge flash
    lit up the sky and then a second as two more capital-class vessels succumbed to
    the ocean of destruction overhead, tens of thousands of crew vaporized with them.
    Henette recoiled slightly when he saw the bald-headed man peel back a layer of
    synthetic skin covering a neural jack at the base of his neck. It was then that
    he noticed the lettering stenciled between the capsuleer's shoulder blades.\n\nThe
    loose cable hung down over the identifying mark of the Equipment Certification
    and Anomaly Investigations Division \u2013 a sub division of the Interstellar
    Services Department, which in turn belonged to CONCORD. The second of the two
    capsuleers showed no emotion, his voice flat and direct. Their features were almost
    completely neutral, as if stripped away purposely with only the slightest hint
    of Gallente ethnicity. Even their accents were neutral.\n\n\u201CDon\u2019t be
    concerned about that. We\u2019re not with ECAID on this one. You can consider
    us freelance.\u201D\n\nThe capsuleer connected to the platform closed his eyes,
    his voice quiet as the rest of the troops set up a defensive perimeter. As he
    spoke, the locked control interface above his head lit up and a set of three enormous
    turrets across the open ground burst into life, their armored shields retracting,
    twin barrels extending and lifting skyward.\n\n\u201CI can unlock the console,
    but if you read me the positioning co-ords this will be much faster.\u201D\n\nHis
    eyes remained closed as Henette called over his commander. Vrie took up vigil
    beside the capsuleer and rested a hand on his back beneath the tangle of wiring.\n\n\u201CWhat
    do you need?\u201D\n\n\u201CPositioning data.\u201D\n\n\u201COne seven. Zero Three.
    Seven Six. Inclination is seven niner point three two degrees. I hope these numbers
    are still good.\u201D was the reply from Vrie.\n\nThe capsuleer repeated the numbers
    in a soft mumble, a frown of concentration creasing his features. The turrets
    across the facility immediately repositioned themselves, aiming up toward the
    blanket of destruction above the cloud line.\n\n\u201CDual 1000mm coils active.
    Siege hardware enabled. Systems ready to fire on your mark.\u201D\n\nThe response
    from Vrie was a simple \u201CDo it.\u201D\n\nHe nodded, the flickering tangle
    of fiber cables swaying like a bio-luminescent ponytail. The two capsuleers raised
    their hands to their ears, and in the first display of emotion they smiled at
    each other as the turrets fired.\n\nThe ground beneath Henette\u2019s feet trembled,
    the trio of turrets belching thorium slugs from each of their barrels in quick
    succession. The speed of their release created a thick white contrail of plasma
    that pierced the clouds, pushing them aside to reveal the carnage in orbit above.
    Even from three hundred kilometers away they could see the impact, the final Wyvern-class
    supercarrier punctured by two of the rounds. They passed directly through its
    heavily battered superstructure before striking the titanium diborite hulk of
    the Shiigeru behind it, the other four rounds slamming into her rear decks.\n\nAs
    the capsuleer spoke again, the roar of a group of hydrogen propulsion cells began
    to drown him out, three more Gunnlogi-class heavy attack vehicles crawling their
    way through the entrance to the complex.\n\n\u201CReloading. Keep them off us
    long enough for a second volley.\u201D\n\n---\n\n<p style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:'Shentox';font-weight:500\">\n17:55
    EVE Standard Time<br>\nMarch 22nd, YC115<br>\nOrbit of Caldari Prime \u2013 Altitude
    \u2013 324km</p>\n\nHer camera drone refocused as the blast wave washed over the
    side of the vessel, debris bouncing against its hull. She played a mental tug
    of war with the Shiigeru\u2019s engineering subsystems. Her voice was carried
    out through the vessel\u2019s announcement system and broadcast across Luminaire\u2019s
    local communication frequency.\n\n\u201CThis is CNS Shiigeru, primary reactor
    containment failure, secondary reactor online. Primary magpulse propulsion system
    failure. We are adrift.\u201D\n\nAdmiral Visera Yanala braced for a second barrage
    of fire from the surface, the vessel\u2018s shield systems beginning to fail as
    critical charge alarms burst through her consciousness. The camera drone moved
    through a smooth wide arc with a single mental command, surveying the burning
    scars that littered the side of the Leviathan-class.\n\n*Spirits, don\u2019t let
    them take her from me...*\n\nShe forced the shield resistance fields to overheat
    again, diverting power from ballistic control to the Shiigeru\u2019s defenses
    as she watched the surface of her own home world deliver another devastating strike.
    She broadcast across the local frequency again.\n\n\u201CThis is CNS Shiigeru.
    Preparing for bombardment of Caldari Prime.\u201D\n\n*I\u2019m losing her\u2026
    I have to offline the rest\u2026*\n\nTitanium diborite plating spilled out from
    the fresh wounds, shimmering in the orange light from Luminaire as a second barrage
    of fire slammed directly into her armored hull. Yanala could feel her grip on
    control loosening. Her targeting systems registered two more locks before a hail
    of antimatter from the squadron of Moros-class dreadnoughts battered the side
    of the stricken vessel and hull breach warnings filled her field of view.\n\n\u201CThis
    is CNS Shiigeru, all hands abandon ship. Repeat, all able personnel abandon ship.\u201D\n\nShe
    could feel the pull of Caldari Prime as the Shiigeru\u2019s systems began to shut
    down in a cascade of critical failures. It was almost as if the planet was willing
    her to return to the surface on which she had been born and raised. Hundreds of
    escape pods jettisoned in union from the flanks of the Leviathan\u2019s superstructure,
    a number of them obliterated by capsuleer fire but the majority drifting safely
    free of the vessel.\n\nYanala\u2019s mind spun with the realization of what would
    happen should the vessel be destroyed in low orbit. Feedback was still being broadcast,
    as confirmed by her commands to offline the Oblivion system and shut down the
    secondary reactor. She watched as the command to jettison the titanium behemoth\u2019s
    magazines was accepted, and over twenty thousand citadel torpedoes \u2013 unarmed
    but highly explosive \u2013 spiraled away from the stricken titan as they fell
    from orbit. Her camera drone kept them in focus as they began to burn up harmlessly
    on entry, a trail of metallic candles falling through the clouds.\n\nShe then
    watched as the squadron of Moros-class dreadnaughts turned their weapons on her
    once more, over a thousand capsuleer vessels pounding at what remained of the
    once proud Caldari Navy flagship.\n\n*This is it\u2026 Now we part ways again\u2026
    I\u2019ll miss you so much\u2026*\n\nThe last group of antimatter charges slammed
    into the titan\u2019s superstructure, thousands of damage report logs and hull-breach
    warnings flashing across the Admiral\u2019s field of view. The Shiigeru seemed
    to arch her back for a second, before a monumental blast shattered her mid-section
    like glass, thousands of tons of steel and titanium diborite thrown out in a graceful
    arc of shimmering metallic confetti. Yanala\u2019s visual feed was stable long
    enough for her to witness the forward half of the Shiigeru drifting toward Caldari
    Prime, its severed decks gaping open and a trail of debris following in its wake
    as it was pushed forward by the explosion.\n\n*Please, let the void take me\u2026*\n\nBlackness
    and silence ensued after the capsule\u2019s connection with the Leviathan was
    severed abruptly. When her feed resumed, she was surrounded by chaos. A pair of
    enormous Comet-class frigates roared past her capsule toward the burning rear
    half of the Leviathan. She watched as its twin reactor cores detonated, the two
    frigates obliterated in an immense blast that claimed the burning remains of her
    vessel.\n\nShe commanded the camera drone to move around in a sharp arc, transfixed
    by the burning trail of molten steel that streaked across the atmosphere below
    her. It was only when the first volley of blaster fire stripped away her capsule\u2019s
    shields that she realized she was pinned in place, her propulsion systems rendered
    useless by the pulsating soft blue hue of a warp disruptor.\n\n---\n\n<p style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:'Shentox';font-weight:500\">\n17:59
    EVE Standard Time<br>\nMarch 22nd, YC115<br>\nCaldari Prime \u2013 601km west
    of Arcurio \u2013 District 2</p>\n\nCaptain Danton Mirelle fed a series of eight
    rounds into his matte green CreoDron shotgun and pushed forward the lever to cock
    the weapon. His back was rested against the side of a concrete foundation for
    the cooling tower that loomed over his squad. Those around him were also tending
    to their weapons when the metallic rattles of their respirators were cut short
    by the voice of their commander.\n\n\u201CThis is Highlander six five alpha, we
    are pinned down. Objective in sight. Heavy resistance. Requesting immediate orbital
    support.\u201D\n\nThere was no response other than the sound of the three State
    Protectorate heavy attack vehicles pounding the opposite side of the cooling tower,
    their cover provided by three of the hyperboloid-shaped structures. Mirelle took
    a deep breath, watching his commander repeat the message to no avail, their comms
    hardware simply giving out a quiet hiss of static.\n\nGunfire rattled around the
    ten-acre complex. A series of grenade detonations interrupted the first few words
    from their squad commander. Their bright flashes cast the shadows of six men against
    the concrete wall.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019re cut off. We push forward, use the dark.
    Mirelle and I will run the flank and take the objective. The four of you provide
    covering support. Our CRU is intact. We have local support but negative capability
    on orbital strike. Comms are down. On arrival, we destroy the batteries with unpinned
    Locus grenades and thermite blasting plastic. Any questions?\u201D\n\nThere was
    silence before Commander Vors Ralle nodded, then signaled for the squad to move
    cover. The six men pushed forward, crossing a short section of open ground. Chunks
    of wet earth were kicked up around their feet as one of the three Sagaris-type
    HAVs spat a barrage of inaccurate heavy machine gun fire at the squad.\n\nRalle
    reached up, smashing a bulkhead light on the wall above them with the stock of
    his shotgun to cast darkness over the entire squad. A split second later, the
    lights to the entire building shut down, followed by the floodlights under the
    cooling towers.\n\nA deep rumble that shook the very ground beneath their feet
    seemed to quell all noise from the battlefield. Several sporadic reports of automatic
    fire broke the silence, as well as the flash and detonation of a grenade somewhere
    at the opposite side of the complex. The entire area then fell silent. The heads-up
    displays on their visors distorted and flickered before vanishing outright.\n\nThe
    group\u2019s commander peered around the corner of the concrete building that
    the squad was now using as cover. The armored helmets of the other five men looked
    to each other, although they could not see the expressions of confusion on each
    other\u2019s faces as Ralle stood upright, lifted his visor, and simply walked
    around the corner into the open.\n\nHis squad members disengaged their own visors
    as the rumbling grew louder. Mirelle called out to his superior, a dim amber glow
    emanating from the open space Ralle had ventured into. \n\nHis head craned around
    the edge of the building before he too stepped into the increasingly bright amber
    glow. The rest of his squad swiftly followed, their voices fading away into silent
    awe.\n\nAbove them, the entire night sky was on fire as the first chunks of burning
    debris passed over their heads. The State Protectorate troops they had been faced
    off against just seconds ago had their faces turned up to the sky in the same
    direction. Every one of them stood inanimate as the wreckage began to pass overhead,
    showering the battlefield with debris.\n\nTiny shards of superheated diborite
    armor bounced against concrete, dropsuits and the armored surfaces of vehicles.
    None of the men seemed to notice, but every one of them closed their visors to
    protect themselves from the rising intensity of the light. Their eyes were fixed
    on an immense spectacle.\n\nNight became day as the forward section of the Shiigeru
    hurtled across the sky, tearing an amber scar through the blackness. Thousands
    of smaller pieces of debris were spread as far as the eye could see, raining down
    across the landscape in the distance with a flurry of bright white flashes.\n\nAs
    the bulk of the wreckage passed a thousand meters overhead, the pressure wave
    beneath it folded the cooling towers over like paper, their reinforced concrete
    structures toppling onto the three heavy assault vehicles that had been in pursuit.
    Every window in the facility imploded simultaneously.  Roofs collapsed, walls
    buckled, and steam rose from the wet ground as debris began to fall around them,
    the sheer air displacement knocking every one of them off their feet.\n\nThe awestruck
    squad watched from the ground as titanium rain poured from the heavens. Superheated
    shards of hull plating slapped into the wet mud with loud hisses while huge chunks
    of half-molten superstructure, some the size of HAVs and dropships, slammed into
    the facility, leveling buildings and destroying the munitions dump at its rear
    in a spectacular hail of fireworks.\n\nThey watched what remained of the Shiigeru
    as she drew closer to the ground, before being scorched from existence as she
    made impact a little over 70 kilometers west of their position.\n\n---\n\n<p style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:'Shentox';font-weight:500\">\n20:23

    Caldari Navy Assembly Plant<br>\nKimotoro Constellation, Caldari State</p>\n\nThe
    blanket was coarse and uncomfortable against her new skin, but she didn\u2019t
    seem to notice. She was transfixed by a wall of monitors on the opposite side
    of the recovery room as she inhaled a deep breath. The odor of medicinal alcohol
    tainted the cool air.\n\nShe watched the mighty vessel break up over and over,
    a hundred different angles from a hundred different media sources. The soft drone
    of the medical bay\u2019s ventilation system was the only soundtrack provided.\n\nSeconds
    later she was watching a perfect black sky. Stars glistened like diamonds spilled
    on black silk. The forward section of the Shiigeru didn\u2019t roll or tumble
    as it came into view. It flew straight and true, the same as it always had. Thousands
    of people, her people, ran for their lives as the man-made meteor scythed across
    the night sky over Arcurio. The holofeeds that were displayed switched between
    security reels, amateur recordings and professional news footage. They all told
    the same story.\n\nShe watched as the remains of the vessel wept amber tears of
    molten metal, scattering the streets with burning titanium diborite. She watched
    as the pressure wave beneath it caused a million windows to implode in unison.
    She watched as the top half of the regional headquarters of the Nugoeihuvi Corporation
    was toppled by the hail of falling debris, crushing thousands on the streets below.
    Finally, she watched as the trail of conflagration vanished over the horizon toward
    the Kaalakiota Peaks.\n\nHer breath was released in a shaky exhalation. Her hands
    trembled as they gripped the edges of the blanket, clutching them together across
    her chest.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m still waiting for an answer, Admiral.\u201D His appearance
    might have changed somewhat, but the voice of Tibus Heth, Executor of the Caldari
    State, still played the same coarse and commanding tune it always had. Yanala
    inhaled slowly, tearing her moistened gaze from the next replay of destruction
    on the wall opposite.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m unsure as to exactly what you\u2019re
    asking, sir,\u201D she replied, her small frame sat upright on the large medical
    gurney. Her feet hung limply above the floor.\n\nHeth stepped forward. Two tall
    and well-built men wearing the dark blue uniform of the Caldari Providence Directorate
    had been flanking him and now one of them reacted immediately, sliding a chair
    into position. Heth seated himself in front of her. Admiral Mininela Erinen, Executive
    Officer of the Caldari Navy, moved to stand alongside him, her freckled complexion
    creased with concern.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m asking why you decided to disregard and
    therefore disobey a direct executive order.\u201D Heth cleared his throat gently
    after speaking, rubbing softly at his larynx with rough skinned fingers.\n\n\u201CI
    believe I already answered that, sir. The Shiigeru was not in proper alignment
    for a strike. We also had a number of Caldari Navy vessels, and a number of Caldari-loyal
    capsuleer vessels which were too close for safe initiation.\u201D Yanala\u2019s
    reply was immediate, without hesitation. Erinen\u2019s eyes flitted back and forth
    between the two of them as they spoke.\n\n\u201CWhy exactly was the 37th squadron
    so closely grouped?\u201D Heth\u2019s voice had taken on an inquisitive tone,
    his eyes focused on Yanala\u2019s tear-soaked expression. Her gaze had returned
    to the scene displayed on the wall opposite. Burning wreckage littered the streets
    of Arcurio; searing white flames tore across the midnight sky. Her voice was quiet,
    but retained its authority as she replied.\n\n\u201CStandard formation in a contact
    fought at close quarters. It is imperative not to drift when in low orbit.\u201D
    Her eyes moved from the carnage to examine the features of her commanding officer,
    as if looking for support.\n\n\u201CAdmiral Yanala\u2019s judgment in this instance
    is sound. Throughout the engagement, she followed standard operating procedure
    taught to all Caldari Navy capital pilots. The main issue we faced was the lack
    of support from capsuleer loyalists. Telemetry shows that some of our own were
    firing on Caldari forces.\u201D Erinen nodded to Yanala as she spoke, Heth\u2019s
    cold gaze examining the expressions of the two women for several seconds.\n\n\u201CThere
    were seven instances when the order was given to fire. Fleet telemetry examined
    by the Caldari Providence Directorate also shows that while charged, Oblivion
    was armed on none of these occasions. This is despite contradictory statements
    made over fleet comms by you, Admiral. How do you explain this?\u201D The growing
    irritation in his voice began to seep through with the question.\n\n\u201CMicromanagement
    of a fleet engaged against over a thousand hostiles leaves room for mistakes to
    be made, Sir. In eight decades of piloting for the Caldari Navy, I have learned
    to minimize the risk of human error. Arming the weapon increases the risk of accidental
    deployment.\u201D\n\nHeth\u2019s jaw tensed, a long slow exhale preceding the
    booming of his voice, his arm swinging around violently to gesture to the collage
    of destruction stretched out across the wall. \n\n\u201CRisk? Do you have any
    damned concept of the word? Take a look at what you have caused. Take a look at
    what your effort to minimize risk has done! Caldari Prime, our home, is burning.
    The embers will smolder for decades due to your failure to act.\u201D\n\nErinen
    cast a sharp glance to Heth, her mouth opening briefly. \u201CSir \u2013\u201D\n\n\u201CSilence!\u201D
    Heth\u2019s finger jabbed in her direction. \u201CYou will speak when addressed,
    or asked a direct question. When I speak to you, you will know, because I will
    look at you. Until then you will be silent.\u201D Erinen blinked with surprise
    as Heth turned his attention back to Yanala, his eyes meeting hers. She almost
    growled as she responded.\n\n\u201CSir, do you honestly think that unleashing
    the full capability of the Shiigeru would have had any less effect than what you
    see behind you? She was capable of vaporizing a capital ship with a single shot.
    Her entire purpose was to destroy anything that posed a threat to her. Firing
    on the surface of our home world would have caused infinitely more damage. I suggest
    that you leave the theorycrafting of military tactics to those of us who have
    served in our armed forces for over half a century.\u201D\n\nHeth\u2019s nod to
    the blue uniformed Provist at his side was barely noticeable. The man made a sharp
    exit, as he continued without missing a beat. \u201CYour suggestion is noted.
    In the same respect, your failure has served as an example to other officers of
    how not to behave in live combat.\u201D\n\nAdmiral Yanala lifted her chin slightly,
    her eyes fixed on Heth\u2019s features. \u201CI believe that my conduct and judgment
    remained exemplary throughout the engagement. However, I will face any consequence
    laid out for my actions.\u201D\n\nHeth folded his arms before the soft hiss of
    the door interrupted the conversation, the blue uniformed Provist reappearing.
    Yanala nodded to herself, her eyes closing briefly before she watched him approach,
    bearing a small tea tray. Erinen could do nothing more than lower her head, her
    fingers gently covering her mouth as he rested the tray on the surface to the
    side of Yanala\u2019s gurney.\n\nHeth stood and uncovered the single shallow tea
    bowl, a small traditional teapot of Achuran origin resting beside it. He carefully
    took the handle, well-practiced in the art of pouring. A soft puff of steam escaped
    the spout before the deep green colored liquid cascaded into the cup.  He spoke
    quietly, the two Provists remaining silent and Admiral Erinen still watching on.\n\n\u201CThe
    paperwork has been filed for your immediate discharge from the Caldari Navy, and
    your cloning contract has been terminated. You know what remains to be done, Admiral.\u201D\n\nA
    gentle, smoky aroma permeated the air as he offered the shallow cup to Yanala.
    She accepted without hesitation, cradling it in both hands. She gently breathed
    in the scent before speaking softly, her tone more that of a disappointed mother
    chastising an unruly child than her usual display of authority.\n\n\u201CThis
    kind of behavior will not solve your problems, and the more people you use as
    scapegoats to cover your own failings and bad decision making, the further you
    press yourself into a corner from which there is no escape.\u201D She smiled,
    and glanced down to the cup before continuing calmly.\n\n\u201CYou may feel that
    this is the honorable thing for me to do in order to pay penance for defying your
    orders, but you are wrong. This is the honorable thing for me to do after having
    allowed your incompetence of command to affect my judgment.\n\n\u201CI will drink
    now as punishment for allowing myself to be forced into choosing the lesser of
    two evils, and for tearing a burning scar across the heritage of every Caldari
    in order to preserve the honor of our people and the sanctity of our home world.
    It has experienced far too much unrest over the last half-decade under your failing
    leadership and crusade to take it back by force.\n\n\u201CBy drinking, I retain
    my honor. I also make the choice to punish myself for the shame I have allowed
    you to bring upon the name of my family. That is the difference between the two
    of us. I will retain my honor, and in time the truth will be known that I refused
    to fire on my home world after being ordered to do so at the whim of an incompetent
    commander who is out of his depth.\n\n\u201CFor the first time in a half decade,
    I can see clearly now. For the time being, you may sit in the ivory tower that
    your Provist thugs have constructed. In the end, it will be torn from beneath
    you by the very people you seek to subjugate in order to cling to your weakening
    grip on power.\n\n\u201CYou may think yourself intelligent enough to be able to
    read the people, but you are wrong. The State\u2019s capsuleer loyalists are already
    beginning to move against Provist policies. How long do you think it will take
    for the people to do the same?\u201D\n\n\u201CAre you finished?\u201D Heth\u2019s
    voice was a soft growl, his gaze locked on the eyes of Visera Yanala.\n\nAs she
    lifted the cup close to her lips, she offered a small smile before drinking.\n\n\u201CYes,
    Tibus, I am. And so are you when our people come to realize what you've done.\u201D"
