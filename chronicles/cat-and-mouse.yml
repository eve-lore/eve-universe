    117/07/03\nFederation Navy Convoy \u2013 Call Sign \u201CHawk 6\u201D*\n\n\u201CEsmes
    Three Tower, this is convoy Hawk Six heavy. Do you copy?\n\n\u201CEsmes Three
    Tower, this is convoy Hawk Six heavy. Do you read?\u201D\n\nFlight Lieutenant
    Risa Harelle allowed her mind to relax a little as the heavy Intaki accent of
    the convoy\u2019s fleet commander echoed through her consciousness, transmitted
    directly through her neural interface from the communications array of her Comet
    class frigate. She panned her camera drone to take in the full scale of the border
    supply depot she would be calling home for the next twelve months. The 58 kilometer
    tall spire of carbonide armor loomed ahead of the fleet as a needle-like silhouette,
    contrasted against the lush green glow of Esmes III.\n\nA single thought commanded
    the safety systems on the weapons of her Comet class frigate to engage, the indicator
    on the flight interface that was projected directly into her consciousness flicking
    from red to green beside a text readout of her call sign for this mission\u2013\u201CKilo
    Two.\u201D Her camera drone refocused on the colors of the Federation Navy projected
    across her vessel\u2019s hull as the voice of fleet command sounded out again.\n\n\u201CNo
    response from Esmes Three Tower. Hold bearing and continue approach pattern.\u201D\n\nThe
    fleet of exactly a hundred vessels, every class represented from titan to frigate,
    glided forward silently as a squad commlink materialized on her flight interface.
    The familiar voice of her squad leader, Jonas Casille\u2013known as \u201CKilo
    One\u201D for this sortie\u2013invaded her thoughts.\n\n\u201CSo, I hear this
    crate has a hell of a pleasure hub. Drinks flowing and holoreels running all day
    and night. How about the twelve of us hit the deck plates once we\u2019re dried
    out and debriefed?\u201D\n\nA chorus of enthusiastic agreements came from call
    signs Kilo Three through Twelve as Harelle began to form a mental list of pre-shutdown
    checks before subvocalizing her own agreement to the mix. Without warning, her
    thought process was swiftly interrupted by a squad of twelve Cyclops fighter bombers
    that cut across her flight path from her port side, the surprise burst of data
    from her neural interface akin to the discomfort of a microsecond of pain in her
    temples.\n\nThe Comet slowed instinctively, responding to her thoughts as the
    group of smaller craft triggered a cascade of proximity alarms. They narrowly
    missed an Algos class destroyer, before cutting beneath the armored hull of a
    Talos off her starboard flank. She was experienced enough not to allow her thoughts
    to be broadcast over the open commlink.\n\nStupid fucking stick jockeys.\n\nShe
    was impressed with the precision of the piloting, but still made a mental note
    of the last four digits of the lead fighter\u2019s call sign as she watched the
    strike group vanish beneath the armored hull of the battle cruiser, repeating
    the numbers in her head.\n\nThree, six, five, four.\n\nHer mind refocused on her
    checklist, the large structure of the supply depot drawing closer before a second
    interruption tore through the silence inside her head. The voice came in time
    with a crescendo of pure white flashes that lit up the black void off her starboard
    bow, telltale signatures of a fleet slowing from hyperspace. Countless golden
    hulls slowed from warp as the fierce voice of Major Lara Rinache\u2013her squadron\u2019s
    wing commander\u2013screamed through her skull. The exhaust trails behind the
    arriving vessels began to dissipate as her comms crackled with activity.\n\n\u201CContact!
    Contact! Bearing 278! Imperial vessels. They\u2019ve gone hostile. Tripwire breach!
    Weapons free. Repeat, weapons free!\u201D\n\n\u201CContact! Contact! Bearing 278!
    Engage at will!\u201D\n\nThe aggressive voice was cut short as squad command took
    control seamlessly, the calm tone of Kilo One caressing her ears.\n\n\u201CKilo
    Squadron five-niner, converge on Kilo One. Delta formation. Objective is defense
    of Nyx class FNS Foxton. Kill order confirmed, weapons free.\u201D\n\nHarelle\u2019s
    safety indicator flicked back to red almost instantly, a sharp increase in her
    heart rate triggering a visual warning from her capsule\u2019s neural interface
    life support system. It was dismissed with a single thought, and the next mental
    command brought the vessel\u2019s microwarp drive system online, shunting power
    from her capacitor banks to her warp pulse capacitor.\n\nThe squadron of Comet
    class frigates converged into a tight formation as their velocities skyrocketed
    in unison, scything a white-hot trail of plasma vapor across the battlefield,
    power enhanced generators overcharged with additional energy.\n\nKilo One\u2019s
    wing was a mere ten meters from the hull of Harelle\u2019s vessel as an explosion
    tore through an Imperial battle cruiser five kilometers off their port side. The
    blast showered the squadron of Comets with tungsten carbide shrapnel as the Oracle
    broke up, smaller chunks of debris vaporizing against their shields, the larger
    sections creating a trail of burning metal left in their wake.\n\nHarelle\u2019s
    brain reactively instructed her to duck, her consciousness mentally recoiling
    from the blast but her physical form remaining inert within the protective shield
    of her capsule\u2019s ovum. The Comet\u2019s photon mainframe reacted instantaneously
    to cancel out her reaction, keeping the vessel on its projected course without
    interruption after checking her flight path was clear.\n\nThe convoy had descended
    into organized chaos around the squadron of Comets as Harelle\u2019s camera drone
    focused on the Foxton. Its massive hull was lit with a conflagration of energy
    weapon impacts and the surging green glow of repair nanites as they drew closer.
    The oldest Nyx class still in service with the Federation Navy after the destruction
    of FNS Wandering Saint, the Foxton seemed to be holding her own against an onslaught
    of dual gigapulse fire from a trio of Revelation class dreadnoughts, their once
    golden hulls burning with an angry amber glow.\n\nHarelle watched as a wave of
    fighter-bombers strafed their golden superstructures with another round of blaster
    fire and incendiary bombs, the glow of detonations against the Imperial vessels
    sending a surge of adrenaline through her consciousness.\n\nA split second of
    confusion blocked her train of thought as she registered the markings of the Amarr
    Navy on the three burning hulls, but her mind was brought back to reality with
    a sharp jolt as electrostatic cynosural discharge dissipated behind the Foxton,
    an Avatar class titan shimmering into existence.\n\nThe group of Comets banked
    to port, the green glow of landing lights flashing past Harelle\u2019s peripheral
    vision in a split second. She was close enough to the flight deck of the Foxton
    for her camera drone to see the tiny figures of fighter technicians swarming the
    birds that remained on deck.\n\nThe frigates climbed, dwarfed by the burning hulls
    of the attacking dreadnoughts as the voice of one of her wingmen\u2013she didn\u2019t
    care to ascertain which\u2013broke comms discipline in frustration after realizing
    the identity of the aggressors.\n\n\u201CWhat the fuck is the Golden Fleet doing
    across the border? Why the\u2014\u201D\n\nKilo One swiftly silenced his complaint.\n\n\u201CComms
    discipline! Stow it! Prepare to engage. Nine tangos. Three o\u2019clock. Seventeen
    klicks. Break and engage. Weapons free!\u201D\n\nWith that, Harelle peeled off
    from the formation, rolling the Comet over as she followed the contour of the
    Revelation\u2019s golden spine. Her focus was absolute, her brain multitasking
    as she willed another burst of power from her warp pulse capacitor. The Comet\u2019s
    exhausts burned white hot, the nimble vessel surging forward as a rush of ionized
    plasma streamed from its tail. Harelle could feel the Comet\u2019s hull flex as
    if it were part of her own being under the stress of the maneuver, the sensation
    like that of stretching for a warm-up before her mandatory daily physical training.\n\nHer
    mind interfaced with the frigate\u2019s magnetometric sensory subsystems, acquiring
    target lock on the nearest of her designated targets\u2013a Slicer class fast
    attack frigate already trailing a mess of conflagration from a previous engagement.
    The Gallente vessel\u2019s onboard processing array worked seamlessly with her
    parietal lobe to calculate target velocity, relative transversal velocity, and
    trajectory.\n\n\u201CKilo Two locked an engaging. Kilo Four, watch my six.\u201D\n\n\u201CI
    got you. All clear.\u201D\n\nWith target acquisition confirmed, her preprimed
    pair of 150 mm rail guns fired, a full volley of hybrid bolts vanishing into the
    trail of burning debris behind the target. The Imperial frigate banked hard to
    starboard in an attempt to avoid the next strike as chatter continued to flow
    among the squad.\n\n\u201CKilo Five towing two Tangos, bearing one six three.\u201D\n\n\u201CKilo
    Nine, I got you. Bring \u2019em around and we\u2019ll clean up.\u201D\n\nHarelle
    followed her target, her focus absolute, the lighter framed Comet banking at a
    tighter angle, lasers returning a volley of multifrequency pulse fire that stripped
    a sizable portion of the Gallente frigate\u2019s shield charge away. Harelle weaved
    to avoid a second wave of laser fire from the faster cycling energy turrets, her
    mind turned out from the carnage unfolding around her as the Federal and Imperial
    navies clashed in the largest Amarr-Gallente engagement since Uriam Kador\u2019s
    failed attempt to invade Ratillose.\n\nThe rear of the Slicer became her whole
    world, her entire mind tuned to the spiraling trail of debris, smoke, and plasma
    vapor ahead of her.\n\nA second volley of railgun fire struck the rear of the
    Imperial frigate as the two vessels leveled out, the Slicer vanishing in a dazzling
    white flash that blazed against the blackness of space. A familiar voice cut into
    her senses as she willed her vessel to dive hard, narrowly undercutting the expanding
    conflagration of shrapnel and debris as her target was consumed by a superheated
    fireball.\n\n\u201CKilo One to Kilo Two. Orders from wing command. An Imperial
    scout has broken away from the main task force. Last sighted in the rocks around
    Esmes Four. Kill mission. Break squad, seek and destroy.\u201D\n\nHarelle\u2019s
    response was instant as she pulled her frigate into a hard roll, lining up with
    the celestial beacon for the only asteroid belt registered in the system. She
    felt her mind roll over with the Comet as they slid into alignment together.\n\n\u201CRoger
    that, squad broken. Kilo Two en route.\u201D\n\nHer vessel reached alignment with
    the beacon as she simultaneously canceled the power shunt to her microwarp drive,
    mentally commanding the vessel\u2019s Roden built warp core into action with a
    single subconscious gesture.\n\nA sudden flash of gold lit up her peripheral vision,
    reflecting against the damaged hulls of a squad of Megathron class battleships
    as they released a volley of lethal blaster fire. Harelle willed her camera drone
    into a fast arc in time to see a sphere of amber light begin to form in front
    of the Avatar. Space itself seemed to ripple in front of the gargantuan vessel\u2019s
    superstructure, electrostatic arcs bouncing between its golden hull and the growing
    sphere.\n\nShe kept focus on the Imperial flagship, her last view that of a golden
    beam of light reaching for the convoy\u2019s Erebus class flagship, before the
    Comet\u2019s warp core catapulted her from the battlefield at two and a half thousand
    times the speed of light, the vessel phasing seamlessly into hyperspace with gut-wrenching
    acceleration.\n\nHarelle immediately busied herself with weapons commands, her
    squad comms now silent as her flight interface registered successful magazine
    reloads. She checked capacitor charge status, ammunition reserves, and drone control
    readiness as the second moon of Esmes Three slipped past in the blink of an eye.\n\nAs
    the vessel began to slow, her camera drone was buffeted from the phase back to
    normal space, static crackling across her field of view for a split second as
    a dense field of asteroids and dust was suddenly pulled from the blackness toward
    her at incredible speed.\n\nBright trails of superheated ionized plasma stretched
    out from the frigate\u2019s exhaust ports as the vessel\u2019s power enhanced
    generators spooled up, slicing a greenish-blue glow across the asteroid belt as
    the frigate slowed. Within a couple of seconds the Comet\u2019s sublight propulsion
    system took over, drawing energy from subspace and immediately pushing her toward
    maximum velocity.\n\nHarelle let out a mental sigh as her field of vision was
    filled with the serene view of light from Esmes, the orange glow from the distant
    star scattered between thousands of rocks that floated gracefully in a natural
    gravity well in orbit of the nearby gas giant. It was almost peaceful, just one
    thing out of place.\n\nA single mental command spurred the frigate\u2019s drone
    control mainframe into action as four wrecks with Serpentis Corporation transponders
    lit up on her flight interface, a flight of three Hobgoblin light scout drones
    emerging from the Comet\u2019s drone bay as the access hatch in its keel slid
    open smoothly.\n\nA fourth signature materialized on Harelle\u2019s flight overview,
    identified by the Comet\u2019s tactical suite as that of an Imperial Navy Slicer,
    twenty kilometers dead ahead of her. She brought her camera drone about with no
    more effort than it would take a mortal to cast their eyes to the side, the faint
    bluish glow of fusion exhausts apparent as the Amarr vessel darted between dense
    dust deposits in the belt, light from Esmes shimmering against its polished hull.\n\nInside
    her head, Harelle smiled to herself as she drew a surge of power from the Comet\u2019s
    warp pulse capacitor.\n\n*Esmes IV \u2013 Asteroid Belt I\n16:57 NEST \u2013 117/07/03\nImperial

    \u201CHelo Eight\u201D*\n\nThe Slicer slid forward gracefully, its sleek twin
    hulls cutting a smooth path through the dust cloud that enveloped the asteroid
    belt. Its pilot subvocalized across secure communications to his squad commander
    as the vessel rapidly recharged the frigate\u2019s tesseract capacitor banks,
    siphoning energy from subspace through its propulsion system.\n\n\u201CHelo Eight
    reporting. No Federation Navy activity, but light Serpentis resistance. Appears
    to be a false positive. It looks like the comms issues are also affecting the
    FEDCAF network. Inspecting Serpentis wreckage before return to fleet.\u201D\n\n\u201CCopy
    that, Helo Eight. Inspection and no salvage, dispose of survivors. RTF ASAP.\u201D\n\n\u201CYes,
    my lord.\u201D\n\nThe Imperial pilot closed distance on the last cluster of burning
    wreckage, one of four Serpentis Corporation Atron class frigates that had dared
    attack when he split from the main strike group. He pulled his camera drone into
    a close frame, inspecting the remains of the noncapsuleer piloted vessel. Its
    hull was no more than a ravaged husk lanced by pulse laser fire, the crew of six
    lost to the vacuum of space.\n\nThe muzzles of the Slicer\u2019s dual light pulse
    lasers still glowed a deep hue of orange, slowly cooling from the contact with
    the pirate vessels as the victorious Imperial Navy pilot brought the vessel about.
    Surprise filled his consciousness as his tactical overlay blinked with activity,
    a Federation Navy contact\u2013frigate class\u2013slipping from hyperspace just
    twenty kilometers from his position.\n\nHis immediate response was to open comms
    again with a message to his strike group as he relayed neural instruction to his
    weapons systems, turrets processing the digital representation of his clear, controlled
    thoughts. His flight interface confirmed the switch from Conflagration to Scorch
    frequency crystals.\n\n\u201CContact, contact. This is Helo Eight. Hostile scout
    sighted. Request permission to engage.\u201D\n\n\u201CNegative, Helo Eight, you\u2019re
    needed with main strike group. RTF. Repeat, return to fleet, Lieutenant Rasanto.\u201D\n\n\u201CCopy
    that.\u201D\n\nThe Slicer was already on the move in an attempt to make range
    on the Federation Navy vessel, dust and small chunks of ore bouncing off its polished
    hull as the vessel climbed to its maximum speed.\n\nThe agile craft weaved between
    a scattering of Jaspet and Scordite deposits, making for clear space as three
    more signatures flashed into existence on Rasanto\u2019s tactical overview, the
    Slicer\u2019s radar sensors identifying them as a flight of three Federation Navy
    Hobgoblin light scout drones.\n\nWith fourteen kilometers between the two vessels,
    several piercing bleeps pierced Rasanto\u2019s skull, the four signatures flashing
    red as the Federal pilot engaged. The golden hull of the Slicer was bathed in
    the soft blue pulsing hue of a warp disruptor as it emerged from a cloud of veldspar
    dust and ore deposits, Rasanto cutting a hard arc around the pursuing Comet and
    darting back into the asteroid field, willing another shunt of power to the vessel\u2019s
    microwarp drive.\n\nHarelle followed, the group of three Hobgoblins rapidly gaining
    on the Imperial vessel, a series of low power alarms sounding as the Slicer\u2019s
    shields were rapidly dissipated by light blaster fire from the trio of automated
    craft. A volley of railgun fire followed, one of the bolts missing its target
    and slamming into a cluster of omber deposits, shattering the larger rocks and
    spilling them into the path of the Slicer.\n\nIn a reflex action, Rasanto\u2019s
    brain commanded his inert body to duck to avoid a concussion from several thousand
    tons of ore debris, the Slicer\u2019s mainframe processing the command into swift
    evasive action that allowed it to dodge a large fragment of rock.\n\nThe remaining
    two bolts struck the port side hull of the Slicer, superheated projectiles cutting
    through the remaining shield charge, buckling tungsten armor as asteroid debris
    rattled across its hull.\n\nDual light pulse lasers returned the argument between
    the two vessels, stripping away the remains of the Federal frigate\u2019s shield
    and scorching a series of strike marks across its knife-like bow as it continued
    to close on its heavier and less agile prey. A second set of fast-tracking pulse
    bursts struck the Comet again, three direct hits tearing crystalline carbonide
    armor plating from the frigate\u2019s starboard side wing.\n\nHarelle commanded
    her turrets to ready a fresh volley of antimatter fire as the pack of three light
    drones pounded at the scarred hull of the slicer, Rasanto pulling range as he
    rolled the low profile of the slicer onto its side, slipping between two enormous
    veldspar rocks.\n\nThe Comet pitched into a steep dive to avoid them, too bulky
    to follow its quarry, its backbone cascading a shower of sparks and rubble into
    space as it glanced the larger of the two asteroids, slipping beneath them. Its
    turrets remained trained on the Slicer as it passed from the line of fire, Rasanto
    commanding his frigate\u2019s nanorepair pumps into action during the brief respite
    from assault.\n\nThe Slicer turned its focus to the pursuing drones as they followed
    through the narrow gap, a flurry of pulse fire obliterating the first, and crippling
    a second that spiraled into a group of rocks, vaporizing as its power core breached
    on impact. Harelle growled to herself inside her head, her consciousness processing
    the anger of having to fill out an equipment requisition form for replacements.\n\nDespite
    this, her subconscious response was immediate: two replacement drones catapulted
    from the Comet as the third continued to batter the Slicer\u2019s port side with
    blaster fire. After several more seconds, the Gallente frigate was back in pursuit,
    cutting a path through a dense cloud of scordite dust that coiled in its wake.\n\nA
    second round of railgun fire slammed into the golden hull, spilling tungsten carbide
    into space in a hail of shimmering metallic confetti as Harelle closed range,
    forcing overheat on the vessel\u2019s propulsion system to close on the rear of
    the battered Slicer. Rasanto pulled his camera drone\u2019s field of view in close,
    splitting focus between his tactical overview and inspecting the damage as his
    pulse lasers cut down another light drone.\n\nHe watched as his vessel\u2019s
    buckled hull plating surged with nanite activity, the tungsten plates bleeding
    shimmering green nanite fluid like blood from the capillaries of grazed skin.
    Hundreds of readouts spilled across his peripheral vision as the Slicer\u2019s
    repair systems invaded his consciousness, informing him of repairs, cycle time,
    power rerouting, and nanite flow pressure through the capillaries of the vessel\u2019s
    armored hull.\n\nAnother volley of pulse fire was trained on the sharply cut bow
    of the pursuing Comet, stripping away its outer hull plating and exposing the
    armored substructure beneath. Harelle skillfully weaved behind a pack of scordite
    deposits as a shield, launching the last remaining drone in the Comet\u2019s complement
    as Rasanto\u2019s vessel banked hard, circling a colossal formation of ore in
    a 180-degree change of direction. The light drones followed dutifully, raking
    the side of the Slicer with blaster fire, the next volley of ordnance from their
    automated turrets exposing the vessel\u2019s port side reactor shielding.\n\nThe
    lighter hull of the Federation Navy vessel closed on the Slicer as its turrets
    cycled again, slides recoiling, spent antimatter shells spiraling from their chambers
    into space before they locked forward again with a fresh load. The impact of the
    next round of antimatter struck the port side booster housing of the Slicer, dense
    black smoke erupting in a billowing trail of conflagration that spiraled wildly
    in the Amarr frigate\u2019s wake. The Slicer\u2019s mainframe spilled tears of
    digital pain into Rasanto\u2019s subconscious, temperature warnings filling his
    peripheral vision.\n\nWithin seconds the vessel began to succumb to the damage.
    Its port side propulsion cooling ruptured as drone fire made light work of exposed
    equipment. With a small explosion, the auxiliary thruster broke away completely,
    Harelle weaving again to avoid being collected in the trail of debris.\n\nRasanto\u2019s
    flight interface lit up in a series of critical failures as the Slicer\u2019s
    systems began to shut down, the vessel yawing violently to port as it began to
    break up. A final volley of pulse laser fire consumed one of the light drones,
    an action that was to be in vain as the substructure of the Amarr frigate finally
    succumbed to heat and stress.\n\nThe vessel\u2019s port side superstructure broke
    loose from the rest of the hull, its thruster extinguishing with the loss of command
    input from Rasanto. The two halves of the frigate spiraled wildly, the discarded
    port side thruster slamming into rock, its reactor detonating in a superheated
    fireball.\n\nThe young Amarr Navy lieutenant became a passenger for a split second,
    a thick plume of black smoke trailing in the wake of the Slicer\u2019s remains
    as the pursuing Comet was pelted with burning coolant and debris. Harelle pitched
    into a steep climb to avoid the growing plume of carnage as flying shrapnel obliterated
    one of her remaining two drones.\n\nA split second before the Slicer impacted
    a group of Scordite deposits, the capsule emergency release charges fired, the
    vessel\u2019s mainframe instinctively sensing risk to its fragile human cargo
    and acting in protection. Rasanto\u2019s senses were filled with screeching hull
    breach warnings, then sudden silence as his flight interface was torn from his
    consciousness and replaced by a simple warning:\n\n__>>> CAPSULE EJECT <<<__\n\nThe
    feed from his camera drone flickered, the images distorted with static as his
    capsule was hurled loose of the wreckage, a trio of severed umbilicals flailing
    behind it.\n\nHarelle felt a surge of adrenaline, tracking the carnage with her
    camera drone as she watched the remains of the Slicer slam into a minefield of
    rocks. Sheer velocity shredded the remains of the golden hull in an angry orange
    fireball as she brought the Comet out of a steep climb.\n\nHer entire mental effort
    was swiftly focused on drawing a magnetometric target lock on the hostile capsule
    that spiraled from the wreckage. The Comet\u2019s BZ-12 sensor suite identified
    the target and acquired lock, a preprimed warp disruptor holding it in place as
    Harelle brought the battered Gallente frigate into a tight orbit, closing in to
    optimal range.\n\nSilence overcame Rasanto, his bruised consciousness reeling
    in the aftermath of the sudden disconnect from his vessel. He braced his mind
    for what was to come upon recognizing the throbbing pulse of a warp disruption
    field, and subvocalized to himself alone, the communications link to his strike
    group severed with the destruction of his ship.\n\nRepeating his chosen words
    to himself, Rasanto waited for the inevitable\u2014the searing white light that
    would cleanse his failure from existence, projecting the very fabric of his soul
    across the stars to the Throne Worlds so that he might live again.\n\nOnly through
    many hardships is a man stripped to his very foundations.\n\nAnd in such a state,
    devoid of distractions, is his soul free to soar.\n\nAnd in this, he is closest
    to God.\n\n*Esmes III \u2013 Low Orbit FEDCAF Border Supply Depot\n17:59 NEST

    allowed a relaxed groan to surface from the depths of her throat as she ruffled
    her damp raven hair with a soft white towel, before rolling her shoulders and
    stretching her neck from side to side. She looked over her smooth complexion in
    the mirror, smirking to herself.\n\nTwo more confirmed kills. A clean 2501 and
    her name on the list for a fifth flight commendation.\n\nShe stood in the bathroom
    doorway with a second white towel wrapped around her slender frame, surveying
    her new quarters for the next twelve months. The tower in orbit of Esmes III was
    just over a year old, one of the newest additions to the tripwire network courtesy
    of increased defense funding under the Roden administration. Some of the equipment
    the Federation Navy provided was still sealed in its original packing. She\u2019d
    have the satisfaction of peeling the plastic from it later.\n\nHer attention was
    drawn to her military issue datapad, its smooth black shape vibrating across the
    glass surface of the table at the center of her living area. She approached, reading
    from the holographic screen, four numbers brought back to the forefront of her
    mind as her eyes ran over the remainder of her squadron\u2019s debrief in thirty
    minutes.\n\nThree, six, five, four.\n\nShe smiled to herself as she lifted the
    datapad from the smooth reflective surface, tapping at it and searching roster
    archives from the day\u2019s operations.\n\n\\>>ROSTER QUERY \\*59 Squadron\\**3654*\n.

    \u2013 FLT. LT. KAVIK, R.\n\u2013 KILLED IN ACTION \u2013\n\nRisa tilted her head,
    shrugging softly as she spoke to no one in particular, tossing the datapad onto
    the black leather cushion of her new sofa.\n\n\u201CWell, Lieutenant Kavik. Lucky
    for you that I don\u2019t need to have your flight status suspended.\u201D\nThe
    trip back to the bathroom was cut short by the ringing of her buzzer. She ruffled
    her hair as she made her way to the door, a view of the other side flickering
    to life, holographically projected against the door\u2019s surface as she approached.
    A familiar figure stood on the other side, his muscled frame wrapped in Federation
    Navy fatigues.\n\n\u201CWho is it?\u201D\n\n\u201CCasille. Squadron debrief in
    sixty. 1900 hours.\u201D\n\n\u201CYeah, I got the memo, sir. I\u2019ll be there
    fifteen before.\u201D\n\nHarelle smirked to herself, swiping a hand through the
    hologram to turn it off before completing her journey back to the bathroom as
    she spoke to herself inside her head.\n\nNot a fucking chance, Casille. Try again,
    boy.\n\n*Irnin V \u2013 High Orbit Maintenance Yards \u2013 Imperial Navy 4th

    CRU Debriefing Facility*\n\nOrin Rasanto took a deep breath, filling his lungs
    with sterile air and sliding his hands across his unnaturally smooth face. He
    exhaled gently and rolled his well-muscled shoulders, looking down to his palms.
    Their virgin skin was several shades lighter than he remembered. He flexed his
    fingers slowly, turning his hands over, fingers fresh and unblemished, nails smooth
    and unmarked.\n\nWater cascaded from the shower faucet behind him, its contact
    with the floor tiles akin to the beat of a thousand drums to his new senses. He
    sighed to himself as he replayed the final moments of the engagement to himself
    inside his head.\n\nHunted by a pack of drones that lashed out like rabid dogs.
    The shrieking of the Slicer\u2019s hull breach alarms. The disorientation of emergency
    release. The strike group\u2019s confusion due to communications failure. The
    unauthorized breach of the Federal border that their commanding officer had maneuvered
    them into.\n\nHe took in another deep breath as he started to wash his hands for
    a third time, feeling dirty despite the sterile environment he was in. The faucet
    over the stainless basin dispensed a frothy mix of cleansing liquids, before switching
    to a gentle flow of warm, clean water. He worked slowly as he regained his senses,
    breathing deeply.\n\nA vibration caught his attention, the screen of his datapad
    flickering to life on the polished counter to his side. His hands stopped as he
    read the screen.\n\nIMPERIAL NAVY 4TH FLEET \u2013\n31ST \u201CNASHAR\u201D SQUADRON\nFAO

    silent for a few seconds, his hands trembling and his jaw tense as he took in
    a deep, slow breath. Unable to contain himself, he lashed out, a meaty fist turning
    the mirror over the basin into a spider\u2019s web of fragments with a colossal
    crash. Crimson leaked from his new knuckles as his hands fell to his side.\n\nOrin
    let out a shaky sigh as he considered his own brown eyes in the fragments of mirror
    that still clung to the wall, confused disbelief painted across his fresh-faced
    complexion.\n\nHis eyes fell to his feet, his head lowered in defeat as braided
    hair fell around his face.\n\nHis tears joined his Brutor blood on the white tiled
    floor.\n"
