    Glittering Dream. How banal, the man thought. He stepped out of the transit tube
    to the top level of perhaps the most famous nightclub in the Federation and walked
    over to the bar. The place was, by its standards, quiet and the crowd parted easily
    before him. At the bar, he glanced in the vast crystal mirror behind it and noted
    his own classically Deteis features with a wry grimace. Ideal, always ideal without
    pre-conditioning. He used the mirror to scan the bar behind him while he gestured
    to the barman for a drink. May as well play the game.\n\nThe woman wasn\u2019t
    difficult to pick out. She was looking directly at him with a faint smile playing
    about her lips and laughter in her eyes. He shook his head, picked up his drink
    and walked over to her table, set at one corner of the vast western picture window.
    Ignoring the breathtaking view of Caille by night, the man looked down at the
    smiling woman with a frown.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m a busy man, Yani. I can do without
    the theatrics.\u201D\n\nThe Gallente smiled more broadly and gestured at the chair
    opposite her with an elegant and perfectly manicured hand. \u201CMy dear old friend.
    Always the direct one. Please sit, talk with me a while and perhaps the, ah, \u2018theatrics\u2019
    as you call them will make a certain amount of sense.\u201D\n\nThe man remained
    standing. \u201CI agreed to this meeting for two reasons. First, you weren\u2019t
    the one who broke contract on me. Second, I\u2019m frankly curious as to what
    you\u2019ve been up to since the takeover. That curiosity is what\u2019s keeping
    me here. But it has limits, Yani, and you\u2019d best come to whatever point you
    want to make quickly.\u201D\n\nYani sighed and held up her hands in a placatory
    gesture. \u201CVery well but, please, sit, \u201Dshe said. \u201CAfter all it
    will be easier on both our necks, no?\u201D The man grunted and sat down in the
    indicated seat, at right angles to the woman. He took a sip of his drink, raised
    his eyebrows and looked at Yani with renewed interest.\n\n\u201CGood, yes?\u201D\n\n\u201CSurprisingly
    good.\u201D\n\n\u201CThis is part of what I want to talk to you about. Let me
    thank you for coming here. I realize you were taking something of a risk...\u201D\n\n\u201CMinimal,\u201D
    the man interrupted.\n\n\u201CWell, just so, but by coming here you put yourself
    on my home ground, so to speak, and I appreciate this.\u201D\n\n\u201CRare is
    the chance to destroy your enemy away from his home, therefore consider his home
    your ideal ground.\u201D\n\n***\n\n \n\nThe Talos-class battlecruiser banked around
    the wreckage of its erstwhile target, riding out the shockwave effortlessly as
    its blasters swivelled back to the center line. The Rokh pilot was still cursing
    over the local band but he must have understood he hadn\u2019t stood a chance.
    Just thrown in the multi-scenario mix along with the rest. The Talos pilot smiled
    in his mind. Pride was a notorious failing of his kind. He\u2019d fallen prey
    to it enough times himself. Kind of pointless to get upset in here, though.\n\nAh,
    the controllers were speaking into his mind again. Annoying, like a rasp on the
    skin. Something artificial to him. Not like the NeoCom. What\u2019s that? They
    wanted him to take on a Drake in close-quarters. He locked down the reflex reaction.
    This was a job, they were paying and what did it matter in the end? Maybe the
    Drake would be a suboptimal fitting. Heavy missiles and slaver\u2019s breakfast
    shield-tank perhaps? Even so, he didn\u2019t fancy his chances.\n\nThese basic
    one-on-one scenarios annoyed him. OK, they happened, sure. Every variation happened.
    He guessed that was the point. He was slated to continue testing for a few more
    days. Real time. That was a lot of scenarios in here. He groaned inwardly, partly
    at the thought of the grind he\u2019d just realized lay ahead of him, partly at
    the sight of the Drake accelerating to meet him. Damn.\n\n***\n\n\u201CRare is
    the chance to destroy your enemy away from his home, therefore consider his home
    your ideal ground.\u201D\n\n\u201CWell, now. Analects of the Raata Empire?\u201D\n\n\u201CNo,
    the War Commentaries of dos Rouvenor. More appropriate to this setting, surely?\u201D
    The man suddenly grinned but the smile didn\u2019t reach his eyes.\n\n\u201CYour
    point is well taken. In fact, it is more relevant than you may realize.\u201D\n\n\u201CYani,
    those limits I spoke about...\u201D\n\n\u201COf course. First, do you require
    any further guarantees of security?\u201D\n\n\u201CNo. Get on with it.\u201D\n\n\u201CAs
    you wish. No doubt you\u2019re aware of the latest arms race between the core
    empires?\u201D\n\n\u201CI am aware of many arms races, Yani. I make it my business.
    You know, all this may not take much time out there,\u201D the man gestured vaguely
    upwards, \u201Cbut it does take some time, and yours is running out.\u201D\n\n\u201CUnderstood.
    I\u2019m speaking of the new battlecruisers. These fast attack, heavy-hitters
    the empires have decided are the new paradigm in warfare they\u2019re going to
    try out.\u201D\n\n\u201COh, those. Yes, of course I know about them. What of them?\u201D\n\nThe
    woman smiled and unfolded her hands. The Deteis noticed that she was wearing an
    exquisitely cut and polished black gemstone on her left ring finger. Despite himself
    he smiled too.\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re familiar with the pattern of this particular
    escalation. The Amarr came up with the Oracle \u2013 a ship design quite out of
    character for them \u2013 and the rest either dusted off some old concepts or
    rushed new designs through. We\u2019ve seen this kind of thing before.\u201D\n\nThe
    man sighed inwardly, but gestured for Yani to continue.\n\n\u201CThe interesting
    aspect of these ships is that, as an attempt to shake up the Empyrean War, they\u2019re
    all designed around the capsuleer market and as such...\u201D\n\n\u201C...as such
    the designs will be on that market very soon. Yani, please tell me you did not
    drag me into this ridiculous proscenium in order to breathlessly offer me advance
    copies of starship designs that will very shortly be available on the open market.
    Please tell me you do not take me so lightly that you imagine I do not already
    have copies of said designs. And please, for the love of the Winds, tell me that
    you have not completely wasted my time and your own with this nonsense!\u201D\n\nYani
    sat back a moment and regarded the Deteis with hooded eyes.\n\n\u201CEvidently,
    you take me lightly, old friend.\u201D\n\nThe man looked down, took a sip of his
    drink, marvelled at the taste and feel of it once more, and looked back up at
    the woman.\n\n\u201CPoint. I apologize. Please continue.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat I
    was about to say is that as warships intended to upset the balance of the Empyrean
    War, each of these designs have been put through a crash program of testing with
    capsuleer pilots. The problem, of course, is that to test the scenarios adequately
    requires time. But the empires didn\u2019t want to wait \u2013 each of them is
    afraid the others will put these monsters out before themselves. What could they
    do?\u201D\n\nAn inkling of where the woman was going begain to creep across the
    man\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201CThey tested everything in virtuality.\u201D\n\n\u201CPrecisely
    so. More than that, they tested everything in the most sophisticated virtualities
    available to them.\u201D\n\nWhat Yani had been driving at all along flashed the
    remainder of the distance across his mind and stood starkly before his apprehension
    like a blazon.\n\n\u201CA tank. You\u2019re talking about a tank.\u201D\n\n***\n\nMagnificent,
    thought the pilot as he took up his position in the ten-strong attack wing of
    Oracle-class battlecruisers.  He\u2019d fallen in love with this new design as
    soon as he\u2019d seen it in holo. To actually fly one and fly alongside others
    was wonderful. Well, he caught himself, not actually, but near enough. This virtuality
    was the best he\u2019d ever experienced. He\u2019d heard of the tanks, of course.
    Everyone with practical knowledge of naval warfare in the Empire had. Combat information
    virtualities capable of simulating space battles in perfect resolution, at many
    times the speed of reality. They were used for research, testing and, most importantly,
    during combat itself. All the major powers used them but he believed the Empire
    had the edge. How could it be otherwise?\n\nKnowing of the existence of a thing
    is not the same as experiencing it, though. Much like God, at that, he mused,
    before clamping down on that possibly heretical thought. He didn\u2019t think
    his connection with this virtuality laid bare his every thought to Pulpit Command,
    but after all it was best not to take chances. He brought his concentration back
    to the attack run. They were closing on the targets quickly, a group of three
    Typhoons. Dangerous opponents in the right hands, but they surely couldn\u2019t
    stand up to this much firepower.\n\nWarp tracks. A lot of them. Small signals.
    Destroyers. The Typhoons had an escort group. The Pulpit channel briefly, and
    slightly irritatingly, confirmed the attack run was to continue. This was what
    they wanted to know, then. Presumably the scenario without the destroyers had
    been run in several variations already with other pilots. He\u2019d been rotated
    in off a very repetitive sequence of attacks on Tempests at close range. It hadn\u2019t
    gone well for the artillery-equipped battleships. The pilot mentally shook himself.
    He needed to concentrate, treat this as if his implants and clone contract were
    at stake. The coming fight promised to be quite interesting.\n\n***\n\n\u201CA
    tank. You\u2019re talking about a tank.\u201D\n\n\u201CMore to the point, I\u2019m
    talking about several tanks. To be precise, the Carthum-Viziam Military Research
    Virtuality, the Duvolle Quantum Holography Facility, the Hyasyoda Naval Research
    Cluster, and Project Dreamwalk. That last one is the rather picturesque name the
    Minmatar gave to their military-industrial virtuality program.\u201D\n\n\u201CYes,
    I know. I also know that any one of the primary tanks operated by those organizations
    is as secure as any virtuality gets. I couldn\u2019t even speak for my own primary
    tank being as secure. Hell, the Duvolle facility is an off-the-books mirror of
    the Black Eagles VCIC. There\u2019s no way anyone\u2019s getting into it.\u201D\n\n\u201COrdinarily,
    you\u2019d be right, about them all. As it happens, the Duvolle job was relatively
    simple and served as the template for the others when it came to ironing out the
    technical details.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re joking.\u201D\n\n\u201CI invite
    you to consider the design history of the Talos.\u201D\n\n\u201CBy K\u2019vire!\u201D
    The man was sitting bolt upright now, his mind racing with the possibilities of
    what he was hearing. He had a thousand questions but as of now there were only
    two important ones. \u201CAlright then, Yani, you\u2019ve got my attention. What
    are you selling and what are you asking for it?\u201D\n\nThe woman smiled.\n\n\u201CLet\u2019s
    start with the price. I recently liquidated some interests in the planetary development
    \ field. As you know, I\u2019ve always had an interest in capsuleer infrastructure
    but generally as a means to an end. It was the same this time and the handover
    deal with InterBus was very lucrative indeed.\u201D\n\n\u201CInterBus? You mean
    to say...\u201D\n\n\u201CJust so.\u201D\n\nThe Deteis shook his head wonderingly.
    \u201CThat was deftly done, Yani. I had my people look at the conglomerate the
    SCC brought in to operate the planetary customs offices. They couldn\u2019t find
    a hint it was anything more than a partnership of chartered investment trusts.\u201D\n\n\u201CIn
    essence, that is all it was. It just so happens that by one means or another the
    majority of those trusts are controlled by me. I had them play their part in setting
    up the network...\u201D\n\n\u201C...and meanwhile you started the pressure to
    end the monopoly through political proxies. No more DED protection in the outer
    worlds. No more station-grade shielding. Sell the outer network to a \u2018neutral
    party\u2019. Ha! I still can\u2019t believe InterBus took them on.\u201D\n\n\u201CThey
    do not understand the outer regions as you and I do, Muryia. They think they can
    raise the tariffs and people will respect their neutrality. Alas for them. But
    not for me.\u201D The woman smiled broadly.\n\n\u201CYou must have made an emperor\u2019s
    ransom out of that deal.\u201D The Deteis took another sip of his drink. \u201CSo
    you don\u2019t want money. You want a favor.\u201D\n\n***\n\nThe dreamwalker resented
    the intrusion of these others in the Dream. They had come with the Tornado and
    he resented the swift-sailing wing of a ship for it. Perhaps unreasonably. But
    he resented the others. They did not even feel the sting of dreamshock when they
    failed. How could they possibly try their utmost without it? Some of the dreamwalkers
    said these others felt something akin to it. Something of their own making. He
    doubted it. They were not dreamwalkers even if they walked in the Dream.\n\nYet
    they did walk in the Dream and they could be the cause of pain if he did not take
    care. His charge today was a Zealot. Like the others in the Slaver\u2019s Fang
    dreamclan, he specialized in the ships and weapons of the Great Enemy. In the
    Dream, he knew nothing else but his duty to fly the golden ships to the best of
    his ability. That and the dreamshock should he fail in that duty. His fellows
    were in a variety of Amarr ships, in close assault formation. Some Crusaders,
    a few Retributions and several  Zealots. Off in the distance, the others. In their
    Tornados. They seemed to sail lazily through space, like birds from a dimly remembered
    other time.\n\nThe Shamans were speaking. The pattern for the battle was laid
    out in their chanting and it signalled a charge on the foe. The Crusaders seemed
    to skip ahead, angling to avoid the direct line of approach. The rest of the ships
    followed, taking wider angles than their smaller and much faster brothers.  The
    enemy were approaching, which meant they were using autocannons, but they would
    try to turn this into a tail-chase. The Crusaders reported making scramble on
    several targets, shutting down their microwarpdrives. Several reported being counter-scrambled.
    Interesting. A few also reported webbing and tracking-disruption. The dreamwalker
    mentally smiled. Foolishness. The mixed electronic warfare across the enemy fleet
    was a good idea in principle, but to reveal the hand by using it all on the Crusaders
    indicated panic. The others would not win this fight.\n\n***\n\n\u201CYou want
    a favor.\u201D\n\n\u201CCorrect.\u201D The Gallente woman played with her black
    gemstone ring. \u201CYou know me well enough to understand that I want back that
    which was always mine. That which I built. And I will have it back. The Snake
    wanted his takeover to be legal, in his twisted way, so legal it was and the stock
    is still traded.\u201D\n\n\u201CStock you\u2019ve been quietly acquiring, I presume.\u201D\n\n\u201CYes,
    I now control sufficient stock to promote my own proxies to the board. Crucially,
    the corporation still controls a large reserve of stock that can be issued by
    qualified majority decision of the board.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou can\u2019t have bought
    enough stock to control that kind of majority... so, you\u2019re going to buy
    Sarpati\u2019s nominees out from under him?\u201D\n\n\u201CPrecisely so. Our old
    foe has one blind spot. Even as corrupt as he is \u2013 so corrupt indeed that
    he would gladly pay for the pleasure of selling himself \u2013 his pride prevents
    him from realizing that a bought man, even a man he has purchased body and soul,
    can generally be bought more easily the second time.\u201D\n\n\u201CAnd you have
    the ready cash to do it. I think I see what the favor is. Even with you two vying
    for control on the market, all that gives either of you is legal recognition of
    sovereign ownership at the Assembly. You need enforcement and that\u2019s where
    I come in, yes?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes. I realize that you are heavily engaged with
    various ongoing contracts but I am not asking for space superiority coverage.\u201D\n\n\u201CJust
    as well,\u201D muttered the Deteis.\n\n\u201CWhat I need is the wherewithal to
    board and seize the stations. Once I have them, my possession combined with legal
    title and the newly-coded DED-grade station shields that will come with it, will
    check the Snake. I would naturally value your services under an ongoing station
    defense and patrol contract.\u201D\n\n\u201CI bet you would. Well, that\u2019s
    going to depend on what you\u2019ve got to offer. They\u2019ve shut you out of
    those tanks by now, I take it?\u201D\n\n\u201COf course. It was to be expected
    that any intrusion into facilities of that kind would have a relatively brief
    half-life.\u201D The Gallente woman shrugged slightly. \u201CFortunately our bandwidth
    was wide enough to extract a considerable volume of tank telemetry in each case.\u201D\n\n\u201CIncredible,\u201D
    whispered the man, half to himself. He finished his drink, the marvellous sensation
    cutting through his thoughts again, then looked up sharply at the woman. \u201CThat\u2019s
    what all this is about,\u201D the man gestured around him and lifted his empty
    glass.\n\n***\n\nAs he adjusted to the virtuality, he realized that the base specs
    of the Naga-class had changed since his last session in the tank. OK, they\u2019d
    fitted rails to it in this scenario but that wasn\u2019t exactly a change. Ah,
    he chuckled, so they\u2019d given up on that idea. Yeah, he\u2019d not been entirely
    impressed by the suicidal nature of the Naga as giant torpedo bomber himself.
    He called up the daily brief. \u201CUnacceptable ratio of losses to tonnage enemy
    mat\xE9riel destroyed.\u201D  Well that was one way of putting it. Megacorp technocrat-speak
    could make fedo crap sound like a mildly annoying stain on the deckplate.\n\nSo,
    today was a basic gunnery run. Test out the new specs with railguns. Opforce was
    a bunch of different targets. As much variety as possible. He grinned, yeah well,
    he\u2019d seen plenty of FDU fleets as ragtag as this in his time. The variety
    was a bit artificial, a bit too much in the one-of-everything vein but it wasn\u2019t
    entirely unrealistic. Squadron strength for the Nagas and decent range with the
    provided setup. This sort of thing he\u2019d do \u201Cdrive by\u201D strikes usually,
    but this scenario was staying basic. No warping. Control test. Free initiative
    scenarios when this was over. According to the brief.\n\nSooner this was over
    with the better. The squadron lined up at distance and a primary was called, nice
    fat Dominix. He wondered why they bothered with using capsuleers for this calibration
    stuff. Eliminating variables probably. Oh, look at that, Dominix down. The Opforce
    were trying to make transversal but the bigger stuff wouldn\u2019t be able to
    do much. Some of that stuff could be dangerous if they got it together though.
    Apoc, Rokh, Tempest, Mega, even the Raven. Squad commander must have taken longer
    adjusting than he had. This target list was terrible. He thought about saying
    something, then noticed the long-range stuff was yellow-boxing him. Check that,
    they were red-boxing and his shields were gone. Mentally he grappled with his
    systems, even as he hoped they\u2019d picked the squad commander as secondary.\n\n***\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s
    what all this is about,\u201D the man gestured around him and lifted his empty
    glass.\n\n\u201CYes. Long as we\u2019ve known one another, I did not think you
    would believe me unless you experienced our capabilities for yourself, if only
    in a small way. The drink is good, is it not?\u201D\n\n\u201CYou\u2019d have been
    fucked if I hadn\u2019t been in the mood for one, Yani.\u201D\n\n\u201CIn war,
    risk. So too in life.\u201D\n\n\u201CHmph, that\u2019s the Analects. A pretty
    trite one too, if you ask me.\u201D\n\n\u201CYes, well, sometimes that\u2019s
    truth for you. As you know, it is important with the higher-level experiences
    that immanence be on the terms of the subject. Otherwise, well, it really never
    works properly. These things can\u2019t be forced.\u201D\n\n\u201CEnough of the
    metapsychology, Yani. That crap always gave me a headache in the Academy and it\u2019s
    no better coming from you. Worse, if anything. It\u2019s time to deal. Straight
    and clear, what are you offering me?\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat am I offering you? Well
    that\u2019s simple enough. I\u2019m offering you this.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat the...\u201D\n\n***\n\nHeavy
    assaults pounding his back and belly, immune system failing, nanobots going inert
    for lack of sugar, what was that light?\n\nAdrenaline rush as he spat light from
    his fingers, swatting stinging bugs, something burning in his vision, heart pumping
    as energy is injected.\n\nVictory ululating in his mind, the Dream unfolding,
    birds falling out of the sky, his legs burning from the microwarpdrive.\n\nGods-damn
    that moron to the hells and back, pressure of light and electromagnetism on his
    skin, the egg sitting there, comrades taking a vengeance for him with spears of
    plasma.\n\n***\n\n\u201CWhat the...\u201D\n\nThe woman was suddenly by his side,
    steadying him in his seat. He looked up at her, vision unfocused then snapping
    back to clarity. He drew in a deep breath and restrained a sudden urge to snap
    the Gallente\u2019s elegant neck.\n\n\u201CMy apologies, old friend, but as you
    have repeatedly reminded me, time is a valuable commodity and what I could have
    attempted to explain at tedious length seemed easier to simply show you.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat
    happened to not forcing it?\u201D\n\n\u201CFor the purposes of this demonstration,
    the raw scope of what I am offering, rather than a synaesthetic accuracy that
    would have required several baseline hours of pre-conditioning to appreciate,
    seemed more convenient. Once again, I apologize.\u201D\n\n\u201CDo I have this
    right? You have personality-level telemetry of capsuleers operating in multiple
    scenarios from no less than four of the most advanced combat information tanks
    in the cluster?\u201D\n\nThe woman smiled. \u201CYes, that is precisely what I
    have.\u201D\n\nThe man grinned back, and this time his eyes were dancing. \u201COK,
    Yani, when do you want to meet for real? I think I can make some room in my calendar.\u201D
    He paused and added, \u201CEven if you won\u2019t look as good.\u201D\n\n---\n\n*Acknowledgements
