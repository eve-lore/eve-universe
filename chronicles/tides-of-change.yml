    stubbed his cigarette on the deck, despite the Kapitan\u2019s earlier admonitions
    about in-station regulations. The old bastard was soft after his years with those
    paper-pushing Fed Navy pod-wetters, soft as the blubber that hung from him. Besides,
    with the situation the way it was today, their high and mighty Legionnaire had
    better things to worry about than a smudge on the platform.\n\nClimbing into the
    pod and fastening himself, Shan reflected on the current state of affairs. Ever
    since the Alliance had been born, the smattering of independent outfits morphing
    and mutating into the massive, brutal beast it was today, things just hadn\u2019t
    been the same in Curse. The Salvies had been the first to complain, of course
    \u2013 you couldn\u2019t fart in Curse space without the Salvies getting up in
    arms about it \u2013 but within a month it had become clear that this new coalition
    was nothing to be taken lightly. Squadron after squadron of Cartel fighters had
    fallen to Alliance battleships as their prized \u2018roid fields were slowly wrested
    from their grasp.\n\nToday, every outpost not huddled like a petrified mouse in
    some gigantic moon\u2019s shadow had been taken over by the CA. Testing facilities,
    assembly plants and munitions dumps now all played host to the behemoth. The Salvies
    did what they can with the left-over minerals afforded by the Cartel\u2019s ninja
    miners, but many of the ships and facilities they had today were still in a sad
    state of disrepair.\n\nThe bay\u2019s speaker clicked on, sending sound ricocheting
    off the metal walls.\n\n\u201CRaider escort, clear for undocking,\u201D came the
    hollow, familiar sing-song.\n\nAs the diagnostic systems finished their run-through
    Shan panned his camera drone three-hundred and sixty degrees around his sharp-tusked
    interceptor, making a quick inspection of the craft\u2019s gleaming hull. All
    in order, it seemed. Ready for another patrol.\n\nThe docking bay\u2019s doors
    hissed open languidly, allowing the undiluted rays of the burning sun to wash
    into the chamber at an angle. Dust motes danced in the columns of light as Shan
    Arvonak, Angel Raider, slid out of the station\u2019s belly into the breathless
    void.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nIt had been exactly one-hundred and thirty-eight
    minutes of soul-crushing boredom when the first hostiles showed up on system comms.
    The opening of the pores, the nearly imperceptible quickening of the pulse, the
    prickle along the back of his neck \u2013 Shan felt the warrior instincts flush
    his system. As had become his custom, using the meditation techniques he had culled
    from the dog-eared Adakul text he kept hidden away in his footlocker, the young
    Raider stilled himself.\n\n\u201CSaddle up, boys.\u201D came the Kapitan\u2019s
    voice over the comm. \u201CWe\u2019ve got two Black Omega.\u201D\n\nShan\u2019s
    composure held, but a tiny tremor shot through him like an electric jolt. Black
    Omega was, by now, one of the Alliance corporations known to every Arch Angel
    operative in the Curse region and surrounding zones of operation. They had recently
    colonized the belts two systems over, and stories abounded of how their security
    wing had rampaged through the area, decimating everything the Cartel had thrown
    at them while barely sustaining losses themselves.\n\nAnd now they were here.\n\n\u201CLine
    formation, fellas.\u201D The Kapitan\u2019s voice was steady, but as Shan swiveled
    his camera drone to alight on the Legionnaire\u2019s massive bulk turning slowly
    planetward he fancied he saw the slightest tremor, a flicker in the burners maybe,
    an invisible apprehension bleeding through the night, staining their resolve.
    Maneuvering his agile frigate into formation between the other two Raiders, he
    awaited the word from Central.\n\nTwenty, maybe thirty seconds passed before the
    Kapitan\u2019s voice came once more over the comm.\n\n\u201COkay, we\u2019ve got
    two unmonitored belts in-system, Planets II and VII. None of the patrolled belts
    have reported sightings yet, so we\u2019re going in for a look. Zeta Wing is en
    route to Planet VII. Align yourselves for gang warp, gentlemen. Planet II, Belt
    1.\u201D\n\nAs time and space coiled into a spiraling tunnel around them, Shan
    promised himself that should he ever become a Legionnaire, he\u2019d stay away
    from those awful group names. \u201CGentlemen.\u201D \u201CFellas.\u201D \u201CBoys.\u201D
    So unprofessional. So unbecoming the discipline and rigour that had made the Angel
    Cartel what it was \u2013 or, rather, had been before the Alliance moved into
    Curse.\n\nThe thought flared up in his head, overriding the nagging trepidation
    that had been playing at the corners of his mind. The usurpers who had spread
    over their domain like a cancer would this day pay for their presumption. Muttering
    a curse under his breath, Shan emerged out of warp.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nAs
    the warp engines died down and the fluid regulation system in his pod performed
    its deceleration compensation, that pleasing backwards flow of liquid over his
    body mingling with the ship\u2019s gentle vibration, he saw the great checkered
    curve of the asteroid belt slide into view beneath him. Seconds later, his scanner
    picked up the hostiles.\n\nThere were two of them, both in Apocalypse-class battleships,
    eighty klicks away, twenty klicks from each other. Too far to get a lock. Simultaneously,
    the three Raiders began preemptory evasive maneuvers, waiting for the Kapitan\u2019s
    word.\n\nThe seconds ticked by heavily as the smaller vessels glid back and forth
    while the Kapitan and his Depredator wingman fumbled for a lock on the intruders.
    Suddenly a feral snarl came hissing through the comm.\n\n\u201CDamn! They\u2019ve
    locked me. What kind of...\u201D\n\nThe words were abruptly stopped as a twisted
    pillar of light blinked into existence between one of the Apocs and the Kapitan\u2019s
    ship. A great translucent globe came briefly into view around the craft, shimmering
    faintly before dissipating along with the enemy\u2019s beam. In perfect rhythm,
    another gout of laser fire emerged from the other battleship, bathing the Legionnaire
    once more in shield-wash. In a few seconds, a macabre staccato of laser fire had
    established itself, all of it centered on the Kapitan.\n\n\u201CGo! Go! Full attack!\u201D
    shouted the fat man in the big ship, his calm veneer now fully evaporated under
    the intense enemy bombardment. His curses now reserved for his incompetent Legionnaire,
    Shan slammed on his afterburners and thrust, rigid with fear, towards the distant
    ships firing those terrible, beautiful beams.\n\nFifty klicks, then forty. An
    explosion sounded behind him as one of his Raider companions was ripped cleanly
    in two by a stray beam, sending a fiery shower of metal parts arcing into the
    black. Thirty klicks. No time to back out now, Shan. Do your part. Trust the Cartel.\n\nAt
    twenty-five klicks, just as the battleships were taking form before him, he heard
    it: that sound, dreaded by every pilot ever to take to the spacelanes, the dreet-dreet-dreet-dreet
    of his sensors informing the auto-targeting systems that his vessel had just been
    locked. Like staring down the barrel of a cannon, thought Shan just as a distant
    boom sounded behind him, marking the destruction of another comrade.\n\nAnd as
    Shan Arvonak, Angel Raider, came into firing range and saw his Howitzers\u2019
    bullets glance harmlessly off the ship he had targeted, saw the awesome bulk of
    the Apocalypse turn to face him like a giant gold-plated snake seconds before
    the light enveloped him, turning his ship into a golden ball of hell\u2019s fire,
    two sudden realizations smacked into his skull, staggering in their clarity.\n\nHe,
    not his enemy, would die this day. And Curse space was no longer what it used
    to be."
