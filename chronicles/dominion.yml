- body: "And on the first day, Aren awoke. He felt quite serene. There was air, and
    light wreathed in smoke, but no gravity. He blinked a few times and tried to orient
    himself. The incense floated in front of him, its tip giving off a bright glow
    that was covered in a globe of gray fog. There was just enough ambient light in
    the room for Aren to see the walls around him, and that faint brightness, combined
    with the fog and the tip of light from the incense, made him feel as if he were
    watching the first tendrils of a sunrise.\n\nHe\u2019d been onboard the chapel
    for longer than he could remember. Years, likely. Time took on a different meaning
    when you were divorced from most of its effects, away from the material world.
    There was the diurnal cycle, certainly\u2014the chapel was in orbit around a planet\u2014but
    Aren\u2019s own version of a full day, which was a few hours longer than a complete
    rotation, had long since overridden it. He had stopped experiencing time as discrete,
    parceled units, and now saw it as one unbroken stream, running from the constantly
    moving now toward that misty end in the distance. A lot of his perceptions had
    changed, here in the celestial chapel.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t alone, and was thankful
    for it; being alone up here would unquestionably have driven him mad. The other
    monks tended to their duties same as he did, albeit at different hours\u2014 everyone
    had their own version of a full day. The only time they were sure to meet was
    during one of the two communal litanies in the prayer room. The arrangement gave
    him all the privacy he needed between himself and God, while ensuring he retained
    the lifeline of a quiet but supportive community. Aside from reciting the day\u2019s
    prayers, he would often not speak a word for weeks. It helped. He\u2019d had a
    lot of thinking to do, over the years, and it had run into dead ends more often
    than he could count. He\u2019d needed all the time God had seen fit to grant him.
    He extinguished the incense\u2014it was the only fire allowed onboard, and was
    never to be left unguarded\u2014then pushed away from the wall and floated through
    the exit.\n\nHe entered a corridor lined with Egonics immersion chambers. Each
    construct, several times his size, combined extensive databases of Scripture\u2014audio
    recitals, holograph images of extant manuscripts, even various sensory replications
    of holy sites\u2014with a fully enclosed capsule whose dark interior came replete
    with any number of virtual interfaces. It would react to its occupant\u2019s every
    move, look, blink, twitch, breath, and brain wave, providing him with organized
    masses of data with which to contemplate the original true word.\n\nAren gently
    brushed his fingers over them as he passed by, enjoying the small bumps and ridges
    on their elongated surfaces. Reality and time became very much internal concepts
    when one was a monk in orbit, and, just as with the daily prayer sessions, it
    helped to ground oneself from time to time. It kept the mind from straying too
    far off the true path. When he\u2019d first come here, his thoughts had been a
    muddle. It had taken him long, so very long, to regain even the capacity for thinking
    clearly. He knew he\u2019d had what those in secular circles elsewhere in the
    cluster persisted in calling a breakdown, but what in the empire was called\u2014if
    you were a holder of any stature, at least\u2014a crisis of faith.\n\nHe floated
    into the common area, where the other monks were enraptured in their work. He
    knew them all by name and they knew him; there was no need for greetings. Aren
    grabbed hold of a handle in the wall, steadied himself, and watched quietly. He
    hadn\u2019t even needed to stop here, but he wanted to experience this little
    world in motion. He had come to feel quite a lot of affection for his fellow men,
    tinged as it was with regret over wasted time.\n\nThe work onboard the space station
    involved human oversight of semiautomated experiments, most of which included
    some manner of biological component. The Amarr Empire was vast, its citizens making
    a home out of practically every manner of environment to be found in the cluster,
    and it was in constant search for ways to fulfill their base needs. Sustainable
    crops. Clean water. Faith.\n\nJoining the floating chapel involved some degree
    of training for the hardships of space, but did not require a heavily scientific
    background. It did demand the capacity to focus\u2014just focus, even for years\u2014on
    the same repetitive tasks, until one had imbued them with so much purpose and
    force of habit that one could no more err in them than one could err in breathing.
    It had occurred to Aren on more than one occasion that the process of rebuilding
    his relationship with God had occurred along a rather similar path.\n\nThe problem,
    one of three that had broken Aren\u2019s will in the distant past and eventually
    forced him to confront a number of unpleasant truths, was that while the Amarr
    Empire was easily the most devout, faithful, and spiritual of the four major factions
    in New Eden, it was also the hungriest. They were expansionists, and it was incumbent
    on their people to create wealth, conquer new territories, subjugate the people
    who lived in those territories, and play a highly complex political game that
    started with the slaves and ran all the way up through the commoners, the holders,
    the heirs, and even the empress herself. \n\nThere were grand structures in place,
    both physical and spiritual, to sustain and feed a complex balance of power between
    all forces in the empire, and holders such as Aren played a pivotal part in maintaining
    it. He had been dissatisfied with this arrangement for a long time, but as with
    many before him, he had believed he could improve the system from inside, and
    had worked without rest for entirely too long with entirely too little to show
    for it: some improvements to his own holdings, a few token concessions from the
    house he served, and nothing more.\n\nAn exhausted wreck, Aren had suffered a
    crisis of faith, renounced his title, given his possessions to charity, shut off
    all communications with friends, family, and allies, and retired to the chapel
    in the sky. A place of quiet contemplation, where their tasks would keep them
    occupied and, more to the point, sequestered and silent, while they considered
    their place in God\u2019s hierarchy. A place offered only to holders, partly because
    commoners were considered to need nothing more than the planet-bound temples in
    the places where they lived, and partly because holders in crisis still wielded
    considerable political power and were considered best kept at arm\u2019s length.\n\nThere
    was no communications equipment onboard except for emergency transmitters, and
    even if a monk lost his mind and used them to call for his evacuation, it was
    well known that a ship would arrive, staff would make inspections, and then the
    ship would leave again without taking on passengers. If necessary, the staff might
    also leave behind extra supplies of sedatives, or, in extreme cases, administer
    a concoction of nanobots that\u2019d travel up the subject\u2019s bloodstream
    and into his brain, where they\u2019d do a little reconfiguring of his hypothalamus.
    Anyone of sound mind who wished to leave could wait for the shipping vessels that
    passed by every so often to bring supplies and other needed goods.\n\nAren allowed
    himself to hover there for a few moments longer, then pushed off and floated out
    of the room. He took a few slow turns along the way\u2014there were no swift movements
    here, not unless you wanted to turn your inner ear into a gyroscope\u2014and eventually
    progressed to a quiet part of the station that held little of any nominal interest:
    items in longterm storage, unused or broken equipment, processed and sealed waste
    materials from various experiments. Refuse. Sometimes it was good to get away
    from people entirely. With the way the Amarr Empire was structured, you could
    barely ever be alone. If you weren\u2019t playing politics, or meeting dignitaries,
    or answering the requests of commoners, you were, even if engaged in private prayer,
    always surrounded by the slaves.\n\nAren floated up\u2014or what he decided was
    up, at least\u2014 to a small cubbyhole on the other end of the room. There was
    a window there that looked out onto inky blackness, and there were harnessed storage
    containers that formed a semienclosed space reminiscent of an attic he\u2019d
    often visited during his childhood. He reached in between two of the containers
    and pulled out one of his most prized possessions: a dog-eared paper copy of the
    Pax Amarria. He had Egonics access to all its texts in holographic form at his
    whim, and while all monks were strongly encouraged to avoid the temptation of
    physical possessions\u2014not just out of sanctity, but to avoid reminders of
    their past lives\u2014this was one he knew he couldn\u2019t be without.\n\nHe
    opened it to a random page and began to read, but his mind kept coming back around
    to the idea of privacy, and all those quiet slaves who had been so browbeaten
    and afraid that they were easily ignored.\n\nHe had professed to believe in slavery.
    The empire had been built on that foundation, and the degree to which its continuation
    was ingrained in the collective psyche was second only to faith in God himself.
    To be against slavery was to be against the Amarr Empire. Some discomfort was
    patiently tolerated\u2014not of the slaves themselves, who didn\u2019t warrant
    that amount of concern, but of the those poor holders whose duties involved dealing
    with the slaves and watching their inevitable suffering whenever a rebellion broke
    out. It tested the spirit, but it worked, and it was necessary. Slaves were not
    to be abused; they held value and were the reason the empire had been able to
    expand to such an extent.\n\nThe slow realization that slavery horrified and disgusted
    him to his very core had completely upended Aren\u2019s life. Not only had he
    lost his taste for the rigid hierarchy professed by the faith, both of this life
    and the next, but he began to feel that the very existence of slavery was an affront
    to any just and decent God, not to mention all his followers. It was anathema
    to a civilized, religious society of any kind.\n\nAt the time, he couldn\u2019t
    possibly express this. In fact, he\u2019d tried to deny it for much longer than
    he cared to admit. But eventually he couldn\u2019t stand it: not one more day
    where he\u2019d strike someone out of a ledger because they\u2019d died, away
    from their homeland, nor yet another night when he\u2019d tally the endless man
    hours worked on the fields, down in the mines, and in the distant depths of the
    asteroid refineries, for no reward other than the lauded glory of the Almighty.\n\nAren
    sighed, rubbed his eyes, and looked out the window. He hadn\u2019t seen his own
    family in a long time, and whatever hours he\u2019d worked here he could no longer
    count. He\u2019d arrived at what he felt was a bitter truth, and his stay up here
    had managed to make it bitter still, full of further doubts and worries. He was
    tired now. Calm, and peaceful at last, but tired.\n\nHe tucked the book in between
    the containers, touched his fingers to the cold glass of the window, then floated
    away as the condensation from his fingerprints slowly faded into nothing. He headed
    for the prayer room. Not the one he\u2019d left\u2014that had simply been an empty
    space in which he sometimes lit incense\u2014but the proper hall of assembly.\n\nIt
    was full of stars. Every surface that wasn\u2019t glass was gilded, ranging from
    a darker, coppery hue in the naves, all the way to a pure, unadulterated shine
    in the sanctuary at the end of the hall. Overhead the glass was paneled in subtle
    polygonal ways, as if it were an empty kaleidoscope.\n\nDepending on where he
    chose to position himself, Aren could look up and see different parts of distant
    space, magnified as if they were right in his own constellation. It was an astonishing
    effect, made all the more potent by its subtlety. The monks were not told about
    it, and did not discuss it with newcomers; it was left up to every arrival to
    discover. Only after the collective had heard the gasp of surprise did they acknowledge
    the fact that the onlooker was looking at distant stars.\n\nThe reason was never
    discussed, but anyone belonging to the Amarr Empire would understand it in a heartbeat.
    Here are our borders, it said. The empire is much larger than you imagined, and
    this grand, wondrous expanse is yours to think of, to maintain, and to grow.\n\nThe
    first time he\u2019d seen it, he\u2019d been crestfallen. The idea of the empire
    expanding throughout the cluster felt like a cancerous infection to him. It was
    already the most expansive of any living faction, and he feared its hunger, its
    need to dominate the world. He\u2019d wanted it to pull back, look inward, reexamine
    old values, and fix itself.\n\nAs he sat in the nave he remembered that feeling,
    and how long he\u2019d kept it in his heart. It was an angry and dissatisfied
    one, but not invalid or unjustified. He had simply come to terms\u2014slowly,
    begrudgingly\u2014with what it should have been directed at all along.\n\nHe stroked
    a hand over the golden pew, and gave the stars one last, long look. It was time
    to leave.\n\nAren let himself float out of the assembly, and headed toward the
    dark room.\n\nEvery Amarr place of gathering, every house of worship, every chapel,
    church, and cathedral had one room just like this, and it was usually the first
    one you passed upon entering. There were times when you needed an absolute absence
    of distraction, an inviolable time and space reserved only for you and the Almighty.
    No burning incense, no whisper or murmur of monks at work. No stars.\n\nIt would
    have no windows and no lighting, and its walls would be thick. It would let in
    air, because you could not always know how long you needed to be in there, but
    the air would be funneled in from secret and labyrinthine channels that would
    not allow a single vibration of sound to be carried with it. If the door was open,
    you entered. If it was not, you would not knock, and you would not wait around.
    The door was open, and Aren entered.\n\nAfter the door had closed behind him,
    he closed his eyes and waited. Shapes made of light and colors revolved in front
    of him. His ears picked up the rustle of his clothes, the sighs of his breathing.
    His skin itched.\n\nHe sat still. Eventually the shapes faded. So did the sounds,
    which graduated to his heartbeat, then a high-pitched whine, and finally nothing.
    He had been gradually relaxing his muscles, and they started giving him the wonderfully
    soothing paradox of a leaden, heavy feel even as he floated in weightlessness.\n\nHe
    opened his eyes to such utter darkness that it went beyond the concept of light;
    and he listened fiercely for any sound, any sound at all.\n\nThere was nothing.
    He was in a void, rendered formless except for the shape of his very thoughts.\n\nWith
    those thoughts he spoke to God.\n\nHe had come to this place, all that time ago,
    burdened with awful truths. He belonged to an empire that professed love for all
    its people, but bound them in a rigid hierarchy, enslaved its strangers, and thirsted
    always for more, more, more. Once he had finally opened up to his feelings, he
    had done so in force and rejected equivocations. The faith and the Lord and the
    flock all disgusted him. No excuses could be made for the way the Amarr Empire
    was run.\n\nA hierarchy rooted in belief was obviously flawed because it couldn\u2019t
    be questioned nor taken apart and rebuilt with ease when it wasn\u2019t working
    efficiently. A society kept running by slavery allowed itself to discriminate
    against its own people at a fundamental level of human rights. An empire in constant
    expansion was impossible to treat as a peaceable entity, particularly when that
    expansion came at the cost of other societies. These three facts had accreted
    on his soul until their weight had finally broken him.\n\nHe had believed himself
    an outsider, and he had not been sure if he had lost his faith, or whether the
    faith was impossible to truthfully sustain if it demanded that he accept the world
    it resulted in. He had fled, which was a cowardly act, but his mind had been in
    disarray and his body weakened to the point of collapse; there had barely been
    anything left of him at all, let alone the will to openly rebel.\n\nHis time on
    the station had helped, first to settle his nerves and let his body heal, then
    to slowly begin examining his thoughts in a calmer, increasingly rational state,
    and finally to gain perspective on the empire and all it stood for. He had come
    to firmly believe that you could not understand certain parts of life unless you
    had been given the opportunity to stand outside them.\n\nWhat he saw every time
    he looked at the planet below him, with all the people living there, was a kingdom
    of hope, aspiration, and stark, unflinching realism. There were hundreds of planets
    like this one, and while all of them might be governed\u2014or at least guided\u2014by
    ideals, those ideals were implemented by flawed, fallible human beings. No matter
    whether they called themselves Gallente, Caldari, Amarr, or Minmatar, or even
    if they belonged to one of the pirate factions scuttling around on the outskirts
    of space, they had ideals, and they tried to live by them, because otherwise their
    societies would fall apart.\n\nBelief might put the hierarchy beyond question,
    but it also gave its people something they could aspire to. Yes, for a few lost
    souls the faith merely added another layer of deceit and intrigue to shroud themselves
    in, but for most people, it gave them ideals and a sense that they could serve
    a truly greater good. If there was nothing else to aspire to, people would find
    something. They would look for whatever they thought would bring them the most
    happiness, and without faith, they would turn to material wealth and inevitably
    ruin themselves in the process. The Caldari had created hierarchies without faith,
    and the corruption that ensued had eventually caused a blooddrenched revolution.\n\nSlavery
    was unfair, brutal, and horrible. There was no getting around that. But what Aren
    had gradually come to realize was that it existed practically everywhere. Not
    in the oversimplified, sentimental sense that all work was drudgery and that the
    poor were doomed to be downtrodden, but in a very real, systematic, insidious
    fashion. Every society in New Eden had a class of people who were forced to do
    the menial\u2014 or demeaning\u2014jobs, and who were punished if they did not.
    There were various terms for these kinds of social conditions, but most of them
    obscured the fact that the people suffering under them had no choice in the matter
    and never would.\n\nThe Amarr were the only ones who had dared to be honest and
    gone to the lengths of codifying the situation, so that some lines of mistreatment
    would not be crossed. Slaves in the empire would get health care far beyond that
    of the Gallente poor dying in the streets of the Federation, and it was forbidden
    to let a slave\u2019s well-being suffer beyond what was necessary for their work.
    Efforts were made to keep families together whenever possible. Slaves could request
    training in various vocations and could aspire to a better life, but the empire
    was honest about what limits were placed on them, and did not maintain some mockery
    of freedom where in reality there was no freedom to be had. \n\nYou might remain
    a slave, but if you worked hard enough and smart enough, your children or their
    children could eventually become free, and at that point, their newly granted
    freedom would be unquestionable: No hidden barriers, no empty promises, no withholding
    of rights. There was a necessity to force people into hard labor, because otherwise
    a great deal of the citizens would suffer, so the empire did it, openly and without
    hesitation, and then provided a clear-cut way out for those who earned that right.
    None of the others did the same, or could with full sincerity ever guarantee freedom
    for those on the lowest rung of the ladder. The Amarr Empire was honest, even
    as that honesty painted it as the villain of civilization.\n\nAnd if it had to
    be done\u2014if society had to have structure, and if that structure had to force
    a class of people into servitude\u2014then not only were these the best ways to
    do it, but there was no longer any excuse for letting the rest of the world go
    on unaffected. The empire needed land for its citizens, and it needed more people\u2014who,
    yes, would become slaves\u2014to work that land in whatever way was needed to
    ensure food, housing, and safety for themselves and everyone else.\n\nOf course
    it was a complicated argument. Of course it couldn\u2019t be simplified if all
    you cared about was philosophy and pure ethics. This was real, and it took heed
    of real people, their proclivities, problems, and inevitable clashes. It was,
    to Aren, the most human attempt at trying to live a good life as an entire society.\n\nIt
    wasn\u2019t right. It wasn\u2019t just. But it was as close to those values as
    anyone could get, and if it had to be done, in order to provide deep spirituality,
    firm structure, and food for the hungry, then this was the least worst way to
    do it.\n\nSo Aren spoke to God, and asked forgiveness. He floated in that void
    beyond the darkness, listening and looking for confirmation.\n\nTime passed. He
    felt no hunger or tiredness. His conviction, so hard won, did not waver.\n\nAnd
    eventually Aren left that room, and retired to his quarters. He would request
    passage on the next supply ship that God saw fit to send. He would rejoin the
    empire, instead of looking down on it from the darkness. He had won the war with
    himself. He loved the world, the Lord of its creation, and every living being
    in it."
