    configuration was new to him. A beautiful one, though it lacked the smooth subtlety
    of the Kaulas patterns, the ones from before the revolution. The Thukker as a
    whole had tended toward violent motifs after the great save, its people too drunk
    on their own rage to remember they were free, and every creation from its cultural
    womb since then had in some way borne fury\u2019s jagged stamp.\n\nHe set the
    object on the table. Before him was a wall, three quarters window, a tinted expanse
    of transnano stretching several meters to both sides and displaying the beginnings
    of a sunset upon the quarter beyond. Underneath the window was the small table,
    its contents cast in deep sun yellow, and at it he sat, his mood darkening with
    each passing minute.\n\nHe stood up, made his way to the desk in the opposite
    corner of the room and sat down at it. On the desk, a modcom was chirping.\n\n\"Shakor,\"
    he said.\n\n\"Emissary Shakor, this is Central,\" sounded the machine. \"Your
    afternoon appointment just arrived at the compound. Are you ready to receive him?\"\n\n\"Is
    this Sergeant Ermika speaking?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Your name isn\u2019t Central.\"\n\n\"Beg
    pardon, sir?\"\n\n\"I said your name isn\u2019t Central.\"\n\nThere was a brief
    pause, then a small nasal exhalation on the other end. \"Thank you, sir. Forgot.\"\n\n\"No
    harm done, Sergeant. Let him in.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nShakor leaned back. Resting
    his elbows on the chair\u2019s metal arms, he locked his fingers together across
    his stomach, tilted his head back against the top of the headrest and let out
    a long breath. He rubbed his eyebrows smooth with two hard strokes. Then he stood
    up, straightened the front of his shirt with his hands and walked back over to
    the window. He was standing there, pensive, when the door buzzer sounded.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nSound
    of someone entering, then a voice. \"Admiral Morata is here to see you, sir.\"\n\n\"Very
    well.\" Shakor turned half in the direction of the door and waited. There was
    a shuffling of footsteps, followed by brief silence.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Your
    Honor,\" came a voice.\n\n\"Hello, Hakram,\" replied Shakor warmly. \"No need
    for formalities, least of all when they no longer apply.\" He cocked his head
    now in the other man\u2019s direction, as if sniffing something out with his mind\u2019s
    eye. \"At ease, soldier,\" he said presently.\n\nHakram Morata, Vice Admiral of
    the Republic Fleet, veteran of hundreds of battles, stiffened a bit, then relaxed.
    He shook his head, slowly. \"How do you always know?\"\n\n\"Blind luck,\" said
    Shakor. \"Have a seat.\"\n\nThe two men made their way over to the small table
    and sat down at each end of it. A cool draft played through the sparse chamber
    as the door slid closed.\n\n\"I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve heard,\" said the
    Vice Admiral, removing his cap and straightening his carefully creased dark olive
    trousers. \"About Yun.\" He studied Shakor.\n\n\"I heard something,\" said Shakor.\n\n\"It\u2019s
    true.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt. Tonight, was it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hakram. \"A
    little under three hours from now.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Shakor cleared his throat.
    \"How that boy has grown.\"\n\nHe stood up and went to a carved wooden cabinet
    set into the wall, from which he gingerly retrieved a glass bottle filled with
    an opaque liquid of darkest brown. He unstoppered it. \"Care for a drop?\" he
    asked, somewhat perfunctorily, as he began to pour the liquid into two small glasses.\n\nHakram
    smiled. \"You know me.\"\n\n\"That I do,\" said Shakor, handing him one of the
    glasses. A rich aroma filled their corner of the large chamber. \"To ours.\"\n\n\"To
    ours.\"\n\nThey drank. Shakor sat down again.\n\n\"So. What can I do for you today,
    Hakram?\"\n\nThere was a studied silence, and then Hakram spoke. \"Well, sir,
    I want to ask you to consider some of the things Keitan is going to talk about
    tonight.\"\n\n\"A-ha.\" Shakor\u2019s brow creased. \"Which things, in particular?\"\n\n\"Well,
    he is going to cover a fair few subjects. For one, he\u2019s going to urge you
    to come back.\" Shakor sat very still and did not react.\n\nHakram\u2019s eyes
    fixed on the spiked orb sitting upon the table. He picked it up. \"You\u2019re
    really in a unique position to do the things that need doing, sir,\" he said,
    quietly.\n\n\"I\u2019m not in a position to do anything,\" replied Shakor. \"I\u2019m
    tired of the things that need doing. I\u2019ve been a member of this carnival
    for too long. I\u2019m tired of collateral damage and lives on my conscience.
    Tired of getting tangled in the political underbrush.\"\n\n\"Tangled?\" Hakram
    put the orb down. \"But you dealt with the Elders, sir. You worked with the Thukkers.
    You circumvented every protocol there is.\"\n\n\"Yes, at the cost of a good woman\u2019s
    political career and the stability of our government. Those aren\u2019t dues paid
    lightly.\"\n\n\"But you did what needed to be done,\" Hakram said. \"You shook
    things up enough for them to be set right again. Why finish with the job half
    done? There is a groundswell of support for you, at the public level as well as
    within the entire structure of government.\"\n\nShakor laughed. It was a deep
    and abrasive sound, the pounding of a punctured war drum. \"Hakram. My boy. Do
    you think public support means anything, with things the way they are?\"\n\nA
    tiny blink escaped one of Hakram\u2019s eyes, a momentary crack in his mask of
    equilibrium. He sat upright in his seat, glad, as so often before, that the old
    man was blind.\n\n\"Not the public\u2019s, necessarily, but the ministers have\u2026\"
    he began.\n\n\"The ministers? That great thunderous gaggle of short-sighted polemicists?
    Oh, yes, I\u2019m sure they love me. They\u2019ll love me until I do something
    that doesn\u2019t quite serve their interests, and then they\u2019ll hem and haw
    and harrumph and draft legislation and set their lackeys to screaming, and before
    you know it we\u2019re back to the low squabbling that keeps us stuck in the mud.\"\n\nAbruptly
    he stopped there, and smoothed his eyebrows with a sharp upward motion of both
    hands. He stood up. Hakram waited, watching him intently.\n\n\"I\u2019m not the
    person for it,\" said Shakor. He walked back over to the cabinet, found the bottle
    and returned.\n\n\"Sir\u2026\" said Hakram. Shakor quieted him with a gesture,
    then held out an open hand. He gave his glass to the old man.\n\n\"I appreciate
    your making the trip all the way out here,\" Shakor said, in a more convivial
    tone. He poured them two more drinks. \"Did you have any problems getting in?\"\n\n\"I
    was questioned a fair bit,\" said Hakram. \"Nothing too bad.\"\n\n\"They know
    what they\u2019re doing.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt, sir.\"\n\n\"If I\u2019m not mistaken,
    there should be some domes perched on the horizon there.\" Shakor pointed in the
    direction of the window. \"They\u2019re synthesizing plants from the homeworld
    over there.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said Hakram. He looked over Shakor\u2019s shoulder.
    Past the sprawl of squat metal buildings beyond the window he saw three gigantic
    skulls jutting out of the landscape, retiring rays of sun laying checkered patterns
    over their silvery pates.\n\n\"Genesis vaults, they call them. They\u2019re aiming
    to eventually have specimens of every known plant from Old Mother.\" Shakor took
    a sip of his drink.\n\n\"Impressive,\" said Hakram. \"Very impressive. Wouldn\u2019t
    have expected it from the Thukkers, to be perfectly honest.\"\n\nShakor set his
    drink on the table. \"I wouldn\u2019t have expected it from anyone,\" he said.\n\nA
    period of silence passed between the two men, leaden with quiet consequence. Shakor
    was sitting with his elbows on his knees, flat palms pressed together, leaning
    forward. Hakram was sitting back, his hat in his lap and his left ankle resting
    on his right knee.\n\nHe switched legs, dusted a bit of lint off his calf and
    said \"Maleatu\u2026 how can I get you to reconsider?\"\n\nAnd so the afternoon
    went.\n\n***\n\n\"I have a message for you,\" said Hakram. He was standing by
    the window, looking out at the flat tops of the surrounding buildings, the tiny
    motes of windowlight like insect eyes in featureless faces.\n\nShakor raised his
    eyebrows and lifted his head slightly in the younger man\u2019s direction. \"Oh?\"
    he said.\n\nHakram came back to his chair and seated himself. \"You spoke of collateral
    damage earlier. About making sacrifices and never knowing whether they had any
    meaning.\"\n\nShakor nodded.\n\n\"Do you remember a decision of that sort that
    you made, twenty-six years ago, when you were fighting in Ammatar space?\"\n\nShakor
    remained quiet, his face impassive.\n\n\"When the rest of the militia heads asked
    you to leave the front because your presence was bringing down too much heat on
    their heads?\"\n\nShakor gave a slow nod, barely perceptible.\n\n\"When, despite
    their insistent cajoling and threatening, you stayed an extra two days in order
    to be able to gather crucial intel that would, it turned out, end up saving the
    lives of millions?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Shakor. \"Very theatrical. You have
    my admiration. Get to the point.\"\n\n\"My message is from one of those commanders.
    Do you remember Silbraur Makusta?\"\n\n\"Of course. He\u2019s a high-ranking member
    of the Justice Department.\"\n\n\"Yes, but back then he led a group called the
    South Rixarn Army. It was one of the smaller militia groups active on the Derelik
    fringe back then.\"\n\nShakor\u2019s eyebrows lowered and his jaw clenched. \"I
    remember the SRA,\" he said.\n\n\"Close-knit group, largely family. Highly specialized.
    Came from a\u2026\"\n\n\"Hakram.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Just give me the message.\"\n\n\"Yes,
    sir. Senior Counsel Makusta heard through a common acquaintance in Fleet brass
    that I was going to go to the Sanctuaries to try and convince you to come back.
    When he did, he had this message delivered to me and said that it was to be given
    to you verbatim.\"\n\n\"I assume you\u2019ve memorized it.\"\n\n\"You know me.\"\n\n\"Let\u2019s
    hear it.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" Hakram began, then hesitated.\n\n\"Let\u2019s hear
    it, Admiral,\" said Shakor.\n\n\"He wants you to know that every single one of
    them would have willingly chosen their fate, had they known the stakes.\"\n\nThere
    was a long pause.\n\n\"Very well, Admiral,\" said Shakor. \"Thank you for coming.\"\n\n***\n\nAs
    the mantle of dusk continued its gentle slide over the moon\u2019s dry skin and
    its inhabitants began to lay themselves to rest, his modcom sounded again.\n\n\"This
    is Shakor.\"\n\n\"Emissary, Ambassador Keitan Yun has requested to speak with
    you.\"\n\nHe spun the orb in his hand for a few moments. How jagged it was.\n\n\"Put
    him through.\""
