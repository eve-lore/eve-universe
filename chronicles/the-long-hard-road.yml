    following is excerpted from a journalistic report by Oisin Theseus for the Solomond
    Institute for Human Progress\u2019s semiannual digest. Reproduced with permission.*\n\nMy
    inquiries into Del\u2019s capsuleer training have met with nothing but polite
    rebuffs. Yesterday, walking around the main capsule training facilities, I snuck
    a look inside a half-open door and, before they politely slammed it in my face,
    caught a glimpse of a vast titanium expanse filled with row upon row of closed
    tanks, about ten feet tall, gleaming metallic under harsh fluorescence.\n\nNothing
    further of note happened until this morning, when I saw a procession of pasty-faced
    young cadets being taken out of the grounds and carted into a medical vehicle.
    Some of them were on stretchers. Others were being led past the cobbled steps
    of the front courtyard, empty eyes staring into nowhere. At one point one of them
    broke free of his minders and took off down the sidewalk, emitting a high-pitched
    whine of terror. One of the medics managed to tackle him before he threw himself
    into the road, but only barely. The spot of blood where his head crashed into
    the sidewalk is still there, darkening in the midday sun.\n\nThey let me see Del
    after that, for the first time in over a week. He was lying on his bunk with dark
    goggles over his eyes and a small IV module connected to his arm. His skin was
    almost translucent and his breathing was shallow. \u201CA solid week in the dep
    tank will do that to you,\u201D he said in a low croak and smiled weakly. I asked
    him what cadets were supposed to take from an experience like that.\n\n\u201CThere\u2019s
    a thing called the mind lock,\u201D he replied. \u201CI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve
    heard the horror stories. Basically, when you\u2019re hooked into a capsule and
    made to meld directly with a starship, you need to have been trained to let your
    proprioception go completely.\u201D\n\n\u201CProprioception,\u201D I said. \u201CDon\u2019t
    hear that one too often.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou know what it means, though?\u201D\n\n\u201CYeah,\u201D
    I said. \u201CAwareness of your own body, right? Placement of your limbs, that
    kind of thing.\u201D\n\n\u201CExactly,\u201D said Del. He rubbed the bridge of
    his nose, then lifted his goggles over his forehead. He winced as the light of
    the room hit his eyes. \u201CIt\u2019s like your body\u2019s spatial compass.
    Have you ever had one of those dreams where you\u2019re doing something and you
    suddenly get the sensation that you\u2019re falling, and you get sort of yanked
    back to life?\u201D\n\n\u201CAll the time.\u201D\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s a momentary
    proprioception failure. Your mind just loses track of where your body is. Now,
    what happens when you get hooked into the capsule is that the mind link interface
    replaces your proprioception. The ship\u2019s hull replaces your own body outline.
    Its shape becomes your shape. And if your mind isn\u2019t a hundred percent used
    to this intrusion, it gets confused. Our innate body compass is so strong that
    it needs to be sublimated entirely before it can be replaced. That\u2019s what
    the sensory deprivation\u2019s about. If your prio gets scrambled, your mind enters
    into this sort of closed loop, oscillating between body images. People can pull
    out of it with certain focus techniques, but they need to be trained really hard
    for a really long time. Usually people just go unconscious and that\u2019s it.
    When they wake up, complete irreversible catatonia.\u201D\n\n\u201CBut why? Why
    does that happen?\u201D I asked.\n\n\u201CSome quirk of our biochemistry,\u201D
    he said. \u201CThey haven\u2019t figured out why it happens yet, just how to train
    people to prevent it. And even still, there\u2019s never any guarantee it won\u2019t
    happen.\u201D\n\n\u201CSobering thought,\u201D I said.\n\n\u201CWell,\u201D he
    replied, fixing his bloodshot eyes on me and breaking into a grin. \u201CNobody
    said this immortality thing was gonna be easy.\u201D"
