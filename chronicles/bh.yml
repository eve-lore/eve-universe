    in the ignition sequence, Hammerhead softly whispered a quick prayer. For a few
    glorious seconds the Oscillator Capacitor Unit hummed to life.\n\nIt all went
    downhill from there.\n\nSuddenly a groaning sound struck his eardrums. Sighing,
    he moved closer to the generator in search of the sound\u2019s origin.\n\n\u201CDamn
    this infernal machine!\u201D he growled. Apparently the generator was producing
    the sound. Probably not getting enough power. Then, a high pitched whine followed
    by a grinding sound which came to a crescendo and stopped abruptly. With all these
    faults, he thought to himself, the Secure Commerce Commission will never approve
    of this as a trade commodity. The scene vanished as he turned off the simulation
    and reached for his pack of smokes.\n\nHammerhead gazed over at his ever-growing
    inbox while he sparked up. \"Star gates offline in Pator, Faulty sentry gun code
    through Arida, Camera Drones flaking out... it never ends,\" he mused as the smoke
    from his cigarette drifted into the air.\n\nTrying to get back on track, he brought
    up the simulation once more. As he was again running his investigation into why
    the component constantly broke down at 2500 GHz he thought to himself, \u201CI
    wonder if I can fit one of these on my Heron... sure would make traveling in less
    scrupulous areas safer.\u201D Focusing on his diagnostic read-outs, he just couldn\u2019t
    understand why the component wasn\u2019t receiving enough power. All previous
    tests had looked promising.\n\nHe decided to call it a day on the analysis - after
    all, there were plenty of other projects to be getting on with. For one, he still
    had to finish the new neural connector user interface along with his colleague
    Tom.\n\nHammerhead dealt with many branches of CONCORD in his day-to-day duties.
    The Secure Commerce Commission, like many other CONCORD branches, was rife with
    red tape and bureaucracy, and extremely stringent when it came to authorizing
    new products as official trade commodities. With such restrictions on the way
    products were released, he had to stick to a strict timeline that told him when
    such products could be out on the street.\n\nHe opened a sub-space comms channel
    with Traveler and waited for the transmission to go through.\n\n\"What's the word,
    Hammer? Do we have a winner?\" Traveler was a Research and Development agent at
    Ishukone who was doing work on various projects for pilots. Hammerhead liked working
    with the R&D agents. They always had new toys for him to play with and they were
    never in much of a hurry due to the fact they got paid by the hour.\n\n\"Sorry,
    Traveler. I've been running some more simulations and the results just aren't
    coming back like I hoped. I expect this project to take at least another three
    solar cycles. The parameters are just wrong and the power supplement is fluctuating
    continuously instead of streaming smoothly,\u201D Hammerhead replied with a sigh.\n\n\"While
    I\u2019ve got you on the line, I think I've figured out a way to enhance Particle
    Accelerator efficiency by 20%, but I'm going to need your help getting the SCC
    to categorize them as marketable.\"\n\nHammer sighed to himself and lit another
    cigarette. It was Monday morning, the start of what looked to be another very
    long week."
