    AGENCY\n\nJuly 2, YC 104\n\nIn a stunning announcement the Aidonis Foundation
    has revealed the recipient of this year's Aidonis Statue, the symbol of inter-stellar
    peace and harmony. Presented to individuals prominent in promoting galactic peace
    and co-operation, the nomination of Heideran VII, the Amarr Emperor, has taken
    many people by surprise.\n\nThe Aidonis Foundation is named after it's founder,
    the former president of the Gallente Federation Aidonis Elabon. To many, Aidonis
    is the greatest president the Federation has ever known. In his time the young
    and energetic president took the lead in bringing the empires together when to
    many it seemed the world was destined for bitter warfare for the foreseeable future.
    Under Aidonis\u2019s leadership the empires met at the historic Yoiul Conference,
    and he was one of the prime catalysts for the creation of CONCORD and its consequent
    brokering of the peace accord that ended the long war between the Gallente and
    the Caldari (though the final peace was only signed some years later, after his
    death). Upon his death his will called for a Foundation to be set up in his name,
    which was responsible for rewarding those persons that most upheld Aidonis vision
    for peace and prosperity in the world of EVE. In the spirit of friendship advocated
    by the former president, the committee that handles the nomination is populated
    by people from every race and culture, equally taking the views of everyone into
    account.\n\nHeideran VII is the first Amarr Emperor to receive the award and the
    decision has turned out to be controversial. There is no denying the fact that
    under Heideran's leadership the Amarr Empire has become much more amiable in it's
    relations to the other empires. Relations between the empires have never been
    better and seem only poised to get even better in the near future and many contribute
    this fact directly to Heideran VII. In fact, those that have expressed outrage
    over the decision have grudgingly admitted that Heideran is a great leader that
    is undoubtedly one of the main reasons for the tranquil world we now live in.
    Their only gripe is with the Amarrian society itself, such as practices of slavery
    and other breaches of human rights.\n\nThese issues, while unquestionably important
    to any philanthropist, cannot deter from the overall picture: that if it wasn't
    for Heideran's personal interest in seeking compromises every time a potential
    political powder keg threatened to explode in the face of the world community
    we would now be living in a world of constant strife and warfare, with untold
    suffering that would encompass. Indeed, the praises and thanks that have rained
    in from every corner of the world of EVE since the announcement was made far outnumber
    the few critics. Heideran VII is the symbol of the peace and prosperity we have
    all come to love and cherish.\n"
