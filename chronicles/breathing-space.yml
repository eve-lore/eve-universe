    Secretary Ramini Vos sat in silent contemplation before the communications panel.
    Thousands of lights and buttons sparkled before him as they tracked a complex
    flow of information; the conversations of a hundred people all tracked in a digital
    language he understood more intuitively than his native Vherokior.\n\nThe Arek'Jaalan
    project had become a 24-hour operation in recent months. Initially, only a handful
    of capsuleers used the Eifyr & Co. networks that he oversaw, maybe a dozen in
    the first few weeks. Nowadays, the capsuleer channel hovered around fifty at all
    times, peaking to double that during the big meetings. Information requests from
    the public had increased even more aggressively, with Eifyr staff - lead in part
    by Vos - now handling upwards of 1,000 unique inquiries a day.\n\nThe most common
    requests were for the basics; what the Arek'Jaalan project was about, and what
    its goals were. These were easily enough explained by the project mission statement,
    a document Vos had relied heavily upon as the requests began to pile up.\n\nThe
    Arek\u2019Jaalan Project was founded to act as a cross-organizational research
    body and common ground for capsuleers to share information about the Sleeper civilization
    and related matters. Our goals are to research these matters, document our findings,
    and then educate the wider capsuleer populace on our work.\n\nOf course, while
    those few words were enough to sate the fleeting and shallow hunger of small time
    reporters (who comprised the vast majority of the requests Vos handled) they left
    out a few important details, to his mind. Unsavory things, perhaps, but as true
    as anything in the document he'd sent out over 800 times already this week.\n\nThe
    whole \"apolitical\" approach was the most obvious omission, Vos mused. Arek'Jaalan
    had struggled to keep the politics out of the science so far. Most likely, the
    intent behind the mission statement was to help this flagging cause, by defining
    the project in purely scientific terms. Not a bad strategy, Vos reasoned, and
    yet one that left questions open about Arek'Jaalan's political stance. Answering
    them required a little more work on his part.\n\nAmongst his many responsibilities,
    the Chief Secretary had the unenviable job of being the primary contact for countless
    backwater planetary governments, both local and foreign. With little in the way
    of success, Vos would have to explain to Amarr officials how a capsuleer project
    backed by Minmatar Republic assets was \"entirely apolitical in nature\". In another
    meeting, often scheduled only hours apart, Vos would be assuring local Minmatar
    governors that despite Arek'Jaalan's refusal to make a political stand, no Republic
    interests (or citizens) would come to any harm through their work. After many
    long months of futile diplomacy, Vos had become increasingly bored with the politics
    of the empires and their unending feuds.\n\nThe Chief Secretary was at hour fifteen
    of a day riddled with such meetings, and as his eyes began to close, and his mind
    began to drift, he would imagine that all these tiny points of light in the comms
    panel before him were actually stars in a universe that he alone was tasked to
    rule over. In these slow moments, he would drift away from Eram, and instead,
    oversee this universe from an uncomfortable metal chair, positioned near the one
    window looking out of his cramped and overheated office.\n\nOn this evening, Vos
    was having a particularly vivid dream in which he, as master of the universe,
    was contending with a troublesome supernova that threatened to dwarf a little
    cluster of stars he\u2019d grown quite fond of, having spent considerable time
    already optimizing their orbits. After many unsuccessful attempts at draining
    the nuclear fuel, he\u2019d been toying with the idea of a well-placed black hole.\n\nThe
    light from the dying star continued to grow, however, and as the tension of his
    fantasies began to mount, Vos (as he would so often do) retreated back the other
    way towards reality, just in time to notice a little supernova of his own.\n\nA
    rapidly growing light on the comms panel told him that someone was taking over
    an entire network hub, which meant either they were about to host a very large
    meeting, or wanted a whole section of the network to themselves. If that wasn\u2019t
    enough to irk Vos, a man who had flown off the handle for much less, these same
    people were requesting the \u201Cimmediate presence\u201D of his superior, Hilen
    Tukoss, the leader of this little research movement Vos had become swept up in.
    \ \n\nThe Chief Secretary took a moment to rub what he imagined was an exhausted
    expression from his face, and opened a private channel to the man in question.
    By the officially posted schedule, Tukoss had only been asleep for around three
    hours. This was easily the worst part of the job.\n\nTukoss answered the call
    promptly \u2013  perhaps instinctively, Vos suspected, as the good leader\u2019s
    head was inclined horizontally across what looked like some very comfortable pillows,
    and his eyes were firmly shut.\n\nVos hesitated. \u201CAre you with us, Tukoss?\u201D
    he offered, after careful consideration.\n\n\u201CWhat could you possibly want?\u201D
    came a voice from the other side. Tukoss seemed to be sinking deeper into the
    pillows with every breath.\n\n\u201CSomeone\u2019s taken the main comms hub all
    to themselves. Obviously it\u2019s one of those people you gave a clearance key
    to,\u201D Vos started, expertly (in his mind) laying the blame for this disruption
    at Tukoss\u2019s feet.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s just two people in there right now.
    They\u2019ve placed a lockout on the whole hub, scheduled a meeting in ten minutes,
    and made strong requests for your attendance.\u201D\n\nAgainst his better judgment,
    Vos continued.\n\n\u201CI really must protest the audacity, sir, of these people
    coming on to our own networks and making demands like this. Eifyr is not a round-the-clock
    information service, nor are we a conference call center. This is really getting
    quite far from how we normally do things.\u201D\n\nTaking a moment to gather his
    thoughts on some new communications protocols, Vos came to realize that Tukoss
    was now staring at him with a haggard gaze that said \u201Cnot now.\u201D Putting
    aside ideas about meeting request forms, he instead set his mind to wondering
    how long Tukoss had been staring.\n\n\u201CThank you, Chief Secretary. Give me
    five minutes.\u201D\n\nVos nodded a silent reply.\n\n\u201CAnd try to give the
    capsuleers a break, too.\u201D\n\n\u201COh, I doubt these ones are capsuleers,
    Tukoss,\u201D he replied, expertly (in his mind) dodging the issue of granting
    the capsuleers any kind of lenience. \u201CThey had capsuleer IDs, of course,
    but not freelance. Their subnet is masked, which means they\u2019re most likely
    operating outside corporate bounds by being here.\u201D\n\nTukoss sprang upright
    in his bed and leaned into the screen.\n\n\u201CWhy didn\u2019t you tell me this
    immediately?\u201D\n\nVos smiled. \u201CWell, with the company we keep these days,
    how am I supposed to tell one visitor from another? Perhaps if we instituted those
    minor tweaks I proposed last week, we could better\u2014\u201C\n\n\u201CSet that
    hub to limited access, and put the archivists and moderators on standby. I have
    a feeling our guests will want them out of the way.\u201D\n\nVos stifled a sigh,
    and with much greater effort, thoughts of all-consuming black holes.\n\n\u201CAs
    you wish, sir.\u201D\n\n***\n\n \n\n\u201CGreetings Mister Tukoss. Thank you for
    coming at such short notice.\u201D\n\n\u201CNo problem, although my Chief Secretary
    wants your head, of course.\u201D\n\n\u201CWell, you can tell Mister Vos that
    he did his job superbly, and just as expected. We weren\u2019t kept waiting long.\u201D\n\n\u201CWe?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes,
    of course. Let me introduce my little team, as best I can anyhow. Our anonymity
    is still required, I\u2019m afraid.\u201D\n\n\u201CI understand.\u201D\n\n\u201CGood.
    You are speaking with a Senator of the Federation. Also present in this channel
    is the operative who acquired the information I\u2019m about to share with you,
    but I will do the speaking for both of us.\u201D\n\n\u201CI see.\u201D\n\n\u201CIn
    addition to the two of us, later on I would like to invite a member of the Krusual
    tribe to this channel. He will be asked to validate the data we provide, so that
    you can be sure it is genuine, and we are who we claim to be.\u201D\n\n\u201CThat
    shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201D\n\n\u201CThe Krusual is associated with your
    project; your Chief Electronics Officer, in fact. Our assumption, which we\u2019d
    like assurance on, is that if he deems the data trustworthy, then you will share
    his judgment.\u201D\n\n\u201CYes. Very well.\u201D\n\n\u201CGood. Let\u2019s talk
    about things in simple terms then, before we start the transfer. Firstly, we\u2019ve
    come to understand that sometime in the future you want to build research libraries
    in deadspace pockets. These will be used to house research undertaken by your
    capsuleer team. Your plan will be to start in with the Minmatar Republic in Eram,
    and branch out to the other empires' space from there. Is this information correct?\u201D\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s
    more or less correct, and I don\u2019t really mind that you have this information.
    It\u2019s no great secret. I\u2019d ask, though, that you don\u2019t go spreading
    it around before we\u2019re ready. This is a sensitive issue and the timing is
    important.\u201D\n\n\u201CWe couldn\u2019t agree more, Mister Tukoss. We came
    to offer some help with that, as a matter of fact. We have news that might inspire
    you to act sooner, rather than later.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat did you have in mind?\u201D\n\n\u201CWe
    have also acquired information on some of the research projects being undertaken
    by the capsuleers in your project. I am sure you realize that some of it will
    draw the kind of attention you truly do not want, and we are not talking about
    mere bad press here, I hope you realize. We\u2019re talking about powerful enemies
    capable of invisibly undermining your every effort.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou mentioned
    offering some help?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes, well, the final piece of information we
    acquired is that sometime soon, the empires will be making a great deal more ripples
    in the pond than your comparatively tiny group could ever hope to in its current
    state. This is an opportunity to make some bold movements on your outpost building
    projects, without drawing the sort of attention I mentioned earlier.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat
    sort of ripples are they going to make?\u201D\n\n\u201CI hope we can trust you
    with these specifics, Mister Tukoss. This information was so well protected that
    for all we know there are less than ten people in the entire cluster who are aware
    of it. We\u2019re telling you in the hopes that you\u2019ll act on it in a specific
    way, and not in any other form. One could get obscenely rich from this information,
    for example.\u201D\n\n\u201CWith respect, Senator, I\u2019d trade my life earnings
    to know the things you do.\u201D\n\n\u201CFlattery and deflection is it? I suppose
    this is your way of agreeing?\u201D\n\n\u201CI\u2019m more interested in gaining
    knowledge than profiting from it. I would think that was clear by now?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes,
    that is certainly the reputation you cultivate. Anyhow, the specifics are this:
    Acting under the pretense of an arms race, the empires are about to release a
    number of new Tech II modules and capsule upgrades. The technology behind these
    developments is Sleeper in origin, and most of it was developed from material
    identified during the Vitrauze Agreement as practically worthless. If the origin
    of these modules and improvements were ever to become public knowledge, this agreement
    would need to be rewritten, something everyone would rather avoid.\u201D\n\n\u201CMost
    interesting, Senator. Thank you for sharing this. I think I see how we can factor
    in here, too. Perhaps though, before going any further, now would be a good time
    to exchange the data and verify everything. If you can do that, and everything
    checks out, then I can promise you we will start pushing on the first site immediately.\u201D\n\n\u201CExcellent.
    We\u2019ll pass it along shortly.\u201D\n\n\u201CWas there anything else you can
    tell me, then? I had some more questions.\u201D\n\n\u201CWe\u2019re sure you do,
    Mister Tukoss. Sadly, we\u2019ve already offered as much as we can, and risked
    a great deal in doing so.\u201D\n\n\u201CI\u2019ll draw my own conclusions, then.\u201D\n\n\u201CWe
    expect you will. Best of luck with the project, Mister Tukoss, and do keep in
    mind that once this matter is settled, you\u2019ll likely be drawing your own
    share of attention too. We suggest you prepare well in the meantime.\u201D\n"
