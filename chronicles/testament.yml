    Region, Ibani System,*<br>\n*Ibani VI, Fortress Teakh tak-Teakh,*<br>\n*YC110.06.10*\n\n\u201CThe
    Order of St. Tetrimon welcomes Her Royal Highness Jamyl Sarum home. God\u2019s
    children rejoice as His light returns home, and the light shall bring death and
    despair on His enemies.\u201D\n\nGrand Master Groven Horm finished speaking, entered
    two priority commands and turned off his terminal. He sat back from his desk and
    contemplated the future that was now unfolding in the heart of the Amarr Empire.
    He looked over at the narrow windows of his work room, noting the weak light of
    distant Ibani filtering through the layers of glass and air that helped to keep
    the heat of the room from wasting out into the frigid realm of the sixth planet.
    It was the middle of the day here at Teakh tak-Teakh.\n\nHorm got up and walked
    over to the nearest window. He stood there, gazing out at the wind-blown banks
    of snow that stretched from the foot of the mountains here, to the distant peaks
    of the next great range to the south. As always, when he contemplated this world,
    his thoughts wandered to the ironies of the Order\u2019s exile here. A grim smile
    played about his lips until his reverie was interrupted by the sound of raised
    voices in the corridor beyond his chambers.\n\nThe Grand Master steeled himself,
    returned to his desk and sat in his chair. The voices had quieted and Horm turned
    his terminal back on. He glanced at his intel and news feeds, reassuring himself
    that the situation in the Empire was contained. There was a firm double knock
    at the door.\n\n\u201CEnter,\u201D said Grand Master Horm.\n\n\\***\n\nKhemon
    Dulsur an-Tetrimon, Seneschal of the Order and Master of the Mother Chapter, had
    been in the main hangar bay overseeing preparations for the Order\u2019s combat
    ships here to lift off and join the main Tetrimon fleet assembling over Ibani
    VI. The Grand Master had been incommunicado since news of the Minmatar invasion
    but Khemon had understood that Horm was likely deep in discussions with the Khanid
    and Amarr commands. As Seneschal, he was quite prepared and empowered to take
    the initiative absent any instructions from the Grand Master. The other Chapter
    Masters had been in full agreement with his provisional plans and were even now
    preparing their own flotillas with a view to the combined Order fleet making rendezvous
    in the Amafi system.\n\nDulsur had been about to make a brief call to his wife
    when the news of Jamyl Sarum\u2019s appearance over Mekhios ripped through the
    cavernous hangar like wildfire. In moments, the shouting was turning to cheering
    as the destruction of the Minmatar Fleet at the hands of Sarum became known. His
    own instinctive shock and rage at what could only be a blasphemy turned to amazement
    as he accessed the intel feed on his hand terminal. Using some kind of unknown
    weapons technology, Jamyl Sarum had destroyed the enemy fleet over Mekhios and
    was even now rallying the Imperial Navy to strike at the remaining Minmatar fleets.
    The priority now was to destroy the enemy fleet operating in Kor-Azor Region,
    precisely the region of the Empire closest at hand to the Order\u2019s forces.\n\nExulting
    in the prospect of joining battle against the subhumans alongside the Imperial
    Navy, Dulsur was about to begin hurrying the preparations anew when the hangar
    bay\u2019s announcement system blared its priority message warning. He stopped
    in his tracks and turned to the nearest speaker array.\n\n\u201CThe Order of St.
    Tetrimon welcomes Her Royal Highness Jamyl Sarum home. God\u2019s children rejoice
    as His light returns home, and the light shall bring death and despair on His
    enemies.\u201D\n\nThe voice was clearly the Grand Master\u2019s and Dulsur winced
    at such an effusive welcome to a heretic who had apparently cheated on her sacred
    duty. Yet this was no doubt the price for the Order being permitted to join in
    the defense of Holy Amarr. They had swallowed worse indignities before now.\n\nWhen
    the announcement system broadcast the \u2018stand down\u2019 signal, his immediate
    reaction was that it was some error. When he saw the signal flashing on a nearby
    screen, he checked his terminal and was astounded to see the stand down order
    confirmed in the name of the Grand Master. Now the shock and rage returned and
    his throat seemed to close as he struggled to master his emotions.\n\nBy now,
    the hangar was in chaos as everyone looked to their comrades in confusion and
    anger. Dulsur glanced at his five personal guards, hard men and women, devout
    even by the standards of the Order. He could see the cold rage that was dominating
    his thoughts mirrored on their faces. Dulsur gestured to them like a man bringing
    a boarding axe down and left the hangar bay with his guards forming a wake behind
    him.\n\n\\***\n\nTo get to the Grand Master\u2019s chambers they could have taken
    an elevator and made a relatively short walk along the corridors of the upper
    donjon. Dulsur chose to climb and stride through the many stairways and passages
    required to walk from the hangar to the donjon. Though his anger urged haste on
    him, knowing that his inner turmoil should not take him over had led him to make
    the longer walk. By the time he and his guard approached the entry to the Grand
    Master\u2019s work room, he was in full control of himself.\n\nStanding sentinel
    at the door were two of the Grand Master\u2019s guard, including Udo, the Paladin
    Senioris of the Order. Dulsur feared no-one in single combat but Udo was among
    a select few that the Seneschal deeply respected as a formidable warrior capable
    of besting anyone on his day, despite his advanced years. Udo had shifted his
    stance to meet the advancing knights, his guard partner moving to support his
    offhand a pace behind him.\n\n\u201CLord Seneschal, if you have business with
    the Grand Master it must await his pleasure.\u201D The Senioris respectfully inclined
    his head.\n\n\u201CSenioris, please give the Grand Master notice that I wish to
    speak with him and allow me entry.\u201D Dulsur was in no mood for protocol and
    delay but there was no reason to speak poorly here.\n\nThe old paladin shook his
    head. \u201CForgive me but I cannot. The Grand Master has instructed me to guard
    the privacy of his chambers during this emergency. He will see no-one and receive
    no notices.\u201D\n\nDulsur was about to reply when one of his own guards pushed
    forward and shouted an oath in Udo\u2019s face. \u201CDamn you, the Empire is
    in flames and we sit on this ball of ice doing nothing. The Seneschal will be
    seen!\u201D Udo\u2019s stance shifted again, his hands readying for action but
    he remained impassive in the face of the insult.\n\nDulsur pulled his man back,
    marking who it was and shouted on his own account. \u201CBe silent! Know your
    place and get out of my sight!\u201D His guard, Joakhim, reddened and looked as
    if he would question this order. Dulsur raised his hand to his own weapon and
    repeated in a low, deadly tone, \u201CGet out of my sight.\u201D The man bowed
    his head and retreated back down the corridor.\n\nThe Seneschal turned back to
    the Grand Master\u2019s personal guards. \u201CWhat is my office, Udo?\u201D\n\n\u201CYou
    are the Seneschal of the Order, Lord Dulsur.\u201D\n\n\u201CIndeed, and what is
    my rank?\u201D\n\n\u201CYou are Chapter Master, here at the Mother Chapter, Lord
    Dulsur.\u201D\n\n\u201CThen on your cognizance of my office and rank, I invoke
    my privilege to enter the presence of the Grand Master on a matter of utmost peril.\u201D\n\nThe
    Paladin Senioris considered these words and again inclined his head. \u201CI am
    sworn to the Order, yours is the right but these others may not enter with you.\u201D\n\nDulsur
    sensed his remaining guards bristle at this but nodded and held up his hand in
    a gesture of dismissal to his retainers. Udo\u2019s partner returned to station
    as the Senioris knocked at the door to the Grand Master\u2019s work room.\n\n\u201CEnter,\u201D
    said Grand Master Horm.\n\n\\***\n\nGroven Horm watched as Udo showed Khemon Dulsur
    an-Tetrimon into his chambers and stood at the door.\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s all
    right, Udo. The Seneschal and I will speak privately.\u201D\n\nThe Senioris nodded
    and closed the door behind him as he left. Horm waited as his Seneschal walked
    over and stood before the ornate wooden desk that dominated the otherwise austere
    work room. A moment passed and it was evident the younger man would not speak
    first. Horm shook his head slightly.\n\n\u201CKhemon. Please, sit and give me
    your thoughts. I see them near bursting forth as it is, you may as well speak
    your piece.\u201D\n\nDulsur nodded and sat in one of the scattering of chairs
    readily available for private conference here. He still did not speak for a moment
    and Horm understood that he was fighting for self-control.\n\n\u201CGrand Master,
    I am confused by your actions. Surely yours is a wisdom that escapes me but I
    would respectfully ask for explanation.\u201D\n\n\u201CKhemon, we are two fellows
    in the Order here. There is no need for ceremony, speak freely and in fraternity.\u201D\n\nDulsur
    nodded. \u201CVery well. Groven, what is the meaning of all this? You welcome
    home either a heretic who has denied her sacred oaths or worse, now that I think
    it, an imposter and deceiver. Yes, it seems she has saved the Empire from ruin
    at Mekhios. The reports continue to confirm this,\u201D he tapped his hand terminal.
    \u201CI took your message for a piece of diplomatic coin to buy our passage and
    assurance of allied status in the Empire but then\u2026\u201D\n\n\u201CThen, I
    issued the stand down order. I understand your confusion. I fear that I will not
    be able to allay your concerns in full. My son, my dear friend and comrade, you
    are of the line of our noble exemplar. You may very well sit where I sit one day.
    I hope and pray it so. Yet there are things that I cannot simply tell you that
    you may understand. I have to ask you to keep faith. To have faith.\u201D\n\n\u201CIs
    this all you can say to me, Groven? You invoke faith as if I am no more than an
    acolyte fresh from the ranks of the novices? You pray in aid St. Tetrimon and
    my own blood? What is this between a Grand Master and his Seneschal? Is this how
    you will explain it to the other Chapter Masters?\u201D\n\nGrand Master Horm smiled
    sadly. \u201CYes, Khemon, this is exactly how I will explain it to the others.
    Do not think I take you lightly or believe that I abuse you or injure faith in
    this matter.\u201D Horm paused a moment then spoke in a firmer tone.\n\n\u201CI
    am the Grand Master, and I tell you this, the Empire is saved and will be made
    stronger than it was before today. A great heresy is even now being undone, not
    founded. We will see a new princeps upon the throne and I tell you that this will
    be the one who has saved the Empire. We shall do nothing to imperil this. Nothing.\u201D\n\nKhemon
    Dulsur an-Tetrimon sat stunned at this, clearly the throes of his anger had left
    him and been replaced by wonder. After a moment he stood and bowed to Horm.\n\n\u201CI
    hear your command, Grand Master, and I obey.\u201D\n\nHorm watched, his sad smile
    returned, as the man who had come to be as a son to him left the room. He closed
    his eyes and sat for a moment before returning to his window. The eyes that now
    looked out at the ice and snow of Ibani VI were bright with moisture.\n\n\\***\n\n*Fortress
    Teakh tak-Teakh,*<br>\n*YC111.01.08*<br>\n\n\u201CGrand Master Groven Horm, you
    have been brought before this Council of the Chapters to answer for your judgment
    in the matter of the Order\u2019s doctrinal attitude to the rule of the one enthroned
    as Empress Jamyl I, previously known as Jamyl Sarum.\n\n\u201CFurther, your instructions
    as to doctrine have been accompanied by direction of the Order\u2019s policies
    with regard to the Amarr Empire, Khanid Kingdom and Ammatar Mandate. These policies
    also entailed an absolute restriction on activity that would aid Holy Amarr\u2019s
    war with the rebel provinces and the infidel Federation.\n\n\u201CThis Council
    charges that you have injured faith and broken the compact of this Order of St.
    Tetrimon. Your failure to supply any arguments of reason in aid of your call to
    faithfulness in these matters, even despite the gravity of recent events, gives
    this Council grounds to consider stripping you of your great office of Grand Master.
    Can you answer this charge?\u201D\n\nKhemon Dulsur an-Tetrimon laid his hand terminal
    to one side and looked the Grand Master in the eye. Horm was sitting at a table
    that had been placed so as to be at the center of a line that might be drawn from
    one end of the half-circle formed by the Council\u2019s meeting table to the other.
    The Grand Master was looking his age but cut a dignified figure that nevertheless
    wore his martial green, copper-trimmed robes of office lightly. Those robes echoed
    the notes of green and copper incorporated into the numerous chapter gonfalons
    hanging from the walls of the council chamber.\n\nHorm wore on his face that sad
    smile Dulsur had grown accustomed to in the months since the Battle of Mekhios.
    The Seneschal nodded slightly to his erstwhile mentor and waited for the other
    to speak.\n\n\u201CAh, my brothers and sisters, do you truly believe that faith
    must be justified at the time of its greatest testing? Have I been so neglectful
    that these are the straits the Order is in? To lose sight of what we stand for,
    even today when the truth has so long been at bay?\u201D\n\n\u201CGroven, you
    are in peril of your position and future here.\u201D The speaker was Chapter Master
    Aelis Zhovoar from Sakht, a silver-haired woman of great charismatic force. \u201CThis
    is more of the same talk you have leaned on since the heretic took the throne.\u201D\n\n\u201CHow
    is it you call the Empress of Holy Amarr a heretic? You are aware of the supernatural
    signs. All the other Royal Heirs bowed to the divine will. The Theology Council
    confirmed it and, yes, this counts for little in our reckoning but did not the
    Apostles also pledge fealty?\u201D\n\n\u201CThe Apostles can do no other or they
    join us in exile. We long ago accepted that the Apostles must remain at the heart
    of Holy Amarr while we stand vigil without. But this means that they are not free
    to speak their hearts. It is of no moment that they pledged fealty in the face
    of the deceiver\u2019s might.\u201D This was Chapter Master Okkarin an-Ardishapur,
    an ancient presence who had long been a thorn in Horm\u2019s flesh, even from
    his fastness hidden deep in Querious.\n\n\u201CAm I to understand, then, that
    this Council arrogates to itself the determination of what constitutes signification
    of the divine will? What then of the judgment of our protector, the King?\u201D
    Horm\u2019s tone now was acid with irony, no great love here for Garkeh Khanid,
    despite his patronage of the Order.\n\nShaking his head in dismay, Dulsur responded
    before any of the others. \u201CThe position of the King is not in question at
    this meeting. How the thawing of relations between Kingdom and Empire affects
    this Order will no doubt concern us at another time. But not now. Let me also
    forestall you on the point of the arch-heretic Karsoth. Yes, you have been vindicated
    on the issue of his fall and the revelation that a vile nest of Blooders had penetrated
    so deeply into the Empire. Many mysteries have been clarified. Not least how it
    was that an Emperor was assassinated within the precincts of the Imperial Palace.\n\n\u201CThis
    is all beside the point. We are all aware of what has followed and what gives
    grave cause for doubting the hand of the divine is truly at work through the person
    of Jamyl Sarum. Is it truly the act of a just and holy sovereign to intrude on
    the most basic rights temporal and religious of her loyal Holders? The so-called
    \u2018emancipation\u2019 is an abomination that has allowed untold numbers of
    slaves to escape from the dominion of Amarr and into the arms of the rebels. Not
    only that, bad enough as it is, how has she treated those who stood upon their
    God given rights?\u201D\n\n\u201CLike an empress,\u201D interjected Horm.\n\n\u201CLike
    a mad empress would! This is to trample on the rights of the Holders to oversee
    the Reclaiming within their fiefs, according to their obligations and those of
    their lieges to them, and so on. The True Faith has rested on the bonds of fealty
    and faith owed to both high and low for millennia. Now this heretic upon the throne
    would destroy that!\u201D\n\nHorm chuckled and shook his head. \u201CHave I taught
    you nothing of our history? Of the history of the Empire and our people? The system
    you believe to have survived until this past couple of weeks was brought down
    centuries ago. The Moral Reforms achieved that and we alone preserve the true
    memory of it in practice and in faith. But you are confusing memory with reality.
    You allow the illusion maintained by the very ones you disdain as in error to
    cloud your vision.\u201D\n\n\u201CEnough! Do you know what was done in her name
    but yesterday? You do know it. We all know it. To free subhumans to join the rebels,
    noble Holder houses were bombarded from orbit. Bombarded, murdered, declared slaves
    along with their families and loyal retainers. This done in the name of God only
    knows what base evil moves her. And you have no answer to the charges but more
    talk of faith in a future that only you can see. It is not enough.\u201D\n\n\u201CAye,\u201D
    spoke Okkarin an-Ardishapur. \u201CIt is not enough.\u201D\n\n\u201CIt is not
    enough, Groven,\u201D said Aelis Zhovoar shaking her head sadly.\n\nHorm looked
    around the table as more voices joined the chorus. \u201CIt is not enough,\u201D
    they all said. He nodded and allowed himself to slump back in his chair, deep
    exhaustion mingling with strange relief.\n\n\u201CGroven Horm, this Council of
    the Chapters finds you have injured faith and broken the compact of this Order
    of St. Tetrimon. We therefore strip from you the office and rank of Grand Master.
    You are reduced to a brother penitent. Who on this Council dissents?\u201D Dulsur
    looked around the table. There was the absolute silence, the total stillness,
    of all holding their breath. \u201CVery well, it is so found and ordered.\u201D\n\nBrother
    Groven Horm nodded once and closed his eyes.\n\n\\***\n\n*Fortress Teakh tak-Teakh,*<br>\n*YC117.08.21*<br>\n\nGrand
    Master Khemon Dulsur an-Tetrimon climbed the spiral staircase of the Penitent\u2019s
    Tower slowly, deep in thought as his mind worked through the implications of the
    news from Amarr. The Empire was in turmoil but the situation did not seem critical.
    There had been no follow up attacks and he had merely placed the Order\u2019s
    fleets on the highest state of readiness. Now he was on his way to consult a man
    who had once been his mentor and master, and now, after the passage of some years,
    had become an oracular advisor of sorts.\n\nDulsur reached the highest level of
    penitent cells and turned into the corridor. A wan light streamed through the
    narrow window at the end of the passage. Noon here on Ibani VI. The old man would
    be sitting by his window. That was good, Dulsur knew. He knocked at the door to
    the end cell. A courtesy.\n\n\u201CPlease enter,\u201D said Brother Groven, his
    voice muffled by the thick cell door.\n\nAs Dulsur had expected, the older man
    was sitting by the window, gazing out at the blue-white expanse stretching away
    from these mountains to the far southern peaks at the horizon. The cell was very
    austerely furnished with cot, plain desk and two chairs. All normal, a penitent
    would regularly be visited by a confessor or chaplain. The shelf of the desk had
    some books in it and this was also normal. The only startling feature of the small
    room was a bookcase well stocked with works of several kinds. This was a luxury
    that Dulsur had allowed Groven Horm in view of his service.\n\n\u201CHow are you
    today, Groven?\u201D\n\n\u201CNo better, Khemon. Perhaps worse. I can no longer
    tell, I am afraid.\u201D\n\nDulsur hesitated at that. His news might be too much
    for the old man. Yet he sorely needed the insights of a man who had foretold much
    that had happened in the last seven years.\n\n\u201CGroven, the Empress is dead.\u201D\n\nGroven
    Horm had seemed to shrink these last few years, age and isolation taking its toll,
    but at this news he seemed to collapse within his penitent\u2019s robe.\n\n\u201CHow?\u201D
    whispered Horm.\n\n\u201CI have told you of the so-called \u2018Drifters\u2019.
    The new threat from Anoikis. They are responsible. A swift strike on the Empress\u2019s
    ship. They destroyed an Avatar-class with her aboard it. There were no survivors.\u201D\n\n\u201CNone?\u201D
    asked Horm, turning to look up at Dulsur.\n\n\u201CNone have been reported and
    the Empress is most certainly dead.\u201D Dulsur sat in the empty chair. \u201CThere
    have been no further attacks. The situation appears to be under control and the
    Empire seems to be in no immediate danger.\u201D\n\n\u201CNo immediate danger,\u201D
    repeated Horm in tones of wonder.\n\n\u201CGroven, I know that this is shocking
    to you. I know that you had always placed great hope in the reign of Jamyl. Hope
    that I still do not understand but have come to respect.\u201D\n\n\u201CHow can
    you respect it when you still believe it to be in error, my son?\u201D\n\n\u201CGroven,
    please, this is no time for our argument. I need your wisdom.\u201D\n\n\u201CTruly?\u201D
    Horm had turned his eyes on Dulsur\u2019s and the Grand Master noted they still
    had that old force.\n\n\u201CTruly. Half a decade in your shoes has taught me
    enough to value your counsel, Groven. Please believe that.\u201D\n\n\u201CI believe
    it, Khemon. But I can only ask you a question. How deeply have you read of your
    family\u2019s works?\u201D\n\n\u201CMy family? I do not understand you. You mean
    our inspiration? St. Tetrimon?\u201D Dulsur was beginning to wonder if the old
    man was in shock and babbling.\n\n\u201CYour entire line, Khemon. All those who
    have carried the noble name of Tetrimon. How far have you read into their writings?\u201D\n\n\u201CI
    have read enough of their history. Their doings and achievements. Perhaps a little
    of their works on Scripture, the Apocryphon.\u201D\n\n\u201CHave you read the
    commentaries of Tetrimon the Fourth on the Apocryphon?\u201D\n\n\u201CNo,\u201D
    Dulsur thought he had probably glanced at them as a novice but this was not reading
    them.\n\n\u201CI believe that the only counsel I can give you today is to read
    them. His \u2018Testament\u2019 is unquestionably the mature expression of his
    ideas. Here now, you can have my copy.\u201D Horm reached across to his desk and
    picked up a volume lying flat on the top.\n\nAccepting the book silently from
    the old man, Dulsur stared at his mentor a moment before looking at the volume
    in his hands. The cover had the words \u2018The Final Testament of Tetrimon IV\u2019
    lightly embossed on the front. He opened it, noting how well-used this copy was.
    The frontispiece had a passage from the Apocryphon quoted in full.\n\n*My word
    lies within all,*<br>\n*All it requires is the breath of faith,*<br>\n*To ignite
    the fire,*<br>\n*So the lost can find their way,*<br>\n*So the fallen can rise,*<br>\n*To
    take their place as my chosen,*<br>\n*For you are all my creation,*<br>\n*And
    are all equal in my kingdom.*<br>\n\nDulsur shook his head slightly and thumbed
    through the book. It was heavily annotated in a hand that he knew to be Groven
    Horm\u2019s. Dulsur looked up.\n\n\u201CI cannot take this. This is your study
    copy, isn\u2019t it?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes, indeed. But I have no need of it now.
    You should have it. I want you to have it. Also, it is the answer to your request
    for counsel. You should read the book.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou can tell me nothing
    more?\u201D Dulsur felt vast disappointment. It was clear the old man\u2019s mind
    was overwhelmed by the news of Jamyl\u2019s death.\n\n\u201CI fear not.\u201D
    Horm hesitated, he seemed to want to say something more, then collapsed back in
    his chair again. \u201CI am tired, Khemon.\u201D\n\n\u201COf course, I will let
    you rest.\u201D Dulsur stood up and opened the cell door.\n\n\u201CKhemon,\u201D
    Horm whispered.\n\nThe Grand Master turned in the doorway and waited.\n\n\u201CI
    am glad it is you, Khemon. Be true, my son.\u201D\n\nDulsur nodded, not trusting
    himself to speak and left the cell with bright eyes.\n\nLater, in the night, Grand
    Master Khemon Dulsur an-Tetrimon received word that Brother Groven Horm had been
    discovered dead by his evening confessor. He had apparently died peacefully in
    his sleep.\n\n\\***\n\n*Khanid Region, Molea System,*<br>\n*Royal Khanid Navy
    Border Post MoNak1,*<br>\n*YC117.09.21*<br>\n\nThey had docked at the border post
    almost an hour ago and Khemon Dulsur was becoming impatient. The journey he had
    just made was significantly longer than the journey from the Throne Worlds. He
    knew his irritation was unfair to the person who had requested this meeting but
    it was a way of displacing his unease at the situation. Much as the Order had
    long lived at the sufferance of Garkeh Khanid, sitting at a table in a Khanid
    Navy installation was rather too pointed a reminder of this for Dulsur\u2019s
    taste.\n\nDulsur glanced at the Khanid officer sitting a little way down the oval
    conference table that filled a room for which it had clearly not been designed.
    Colonel General Soshan Fayez had struck Dulsur as a hard but shrewd man upon meeting
    him in the hangar bay of the border post. Dulsur had also noted the Khanid ancestry
    of the soldier and the Uhlans insignia on his uniform. An experienced, elite soldier.
    Garkeh not missing a trick in his messaging.\n\n\u201CGeneral Fayez, do you have
    any word of your other visitors?\u201D\n\n\u201CI believe their ship has just
    docked. They should be joining us momentarily, Grand Master.\u201D\n\nDulsur nodded
    and resolved to show no further emotion for however long \u2018momentarily\u2019
    might actually be. As it turned out, a few minutes later a chime sounded at the
    door and the General got up to welcome the delegation from Amarr.\n\nInto the
    room came a tall, handsome man of advancing years but clearly hale, and striking
    Dulsur immediately as a person of some perspicacity. From his ornate yet dignified
    robes, it was clear that this must be High Chaplain Kalefa Sufrin an-Kador of
    the Emperor Family. Two others accompanied Sufrin, a man wearing similar but much
    less ornate robes and a woman wearing a military uniform that Dulsur recognized
    as that of the Imperial Guard.\n\nDulsur stood up and walked half-way around the
    table to meet the High Chaplain, who had swiftly advanced with his hands extended.
    They clasped hands, Dulsur somewhat taken aback by the warmth of the gesture from
    Sufrin.\n\n\u201CGeneral Fayez,\u201D the High Chaplain turned to the Khanid officer.
    \u201CThe other Heirs saw no need to have representatives present, nor would I
    have agreed to it. I see no reason why His Majesty should benefit from your attendance
    at my meeting with the Grand Master.\u201D\n\nDulsur started at the words \u2018the
    other Heirs\u2019 but all the same caught the flush that darkened Fayez\u2019s
    features. The Khanid officer hesitated then nodded and left the room. High Chaplain
    Kalefa Sufrin an-Kador watched him go before turning back to Dulsur.\n\n\u201CThat
    was perhaps a rather superfluous act,\u201D Sufrin waved at the ceiling of the
    room, smiling wryly, and Dulsur immediately took his meaning according as it did
    with his own assumptions. \u201CHowever, a man in my position must insist on the
    appearances, even if the reality is not quite as we would wish it. Shall we sit?\u201D\n\nDulsur
    nodded curtly and returned to his seat. As he lowered himself into the chair,
    he noted that Sufrin had followed him and sat almost next to him at the table.
    Dulsur\u2019s questioning glance evoked another smile from the High Chaplain.\n\n\u201CI
    would rather not have us bellowing at one another across this absurdly large table,
    Grand Master.\u201D\n\n\u201CI suppose that could be tiring after a while, though
    I hope our talk will not take too long, High Chaplain.\u201D\n\n\u201CI do not
    think it will but let me first thank you for making the trip from Ibani, I realize
    that your office is one with many demands on your time. I am sorry that I am perhaps
    adding to them.\u201D\n\n\u201CAll courtesies aside, your own time has surely
    been fully occupied these last few weeks, not least yesterday. I admit to being
    curious as to what is so important that we must meet in person here.\u201D Dulsur
    waved vaguely around the room. \u201CBut one point first, I marked your words
    to Fayez. You said \u2018the other Heirs\u2019 when speaking of Garkeh Khanid.
    What does that mean?\u201D\n\n\u201CAh, there you come very much to the point,
    Grand Master. Very much to the point. Put simply it means that the right of Garkeh
    Khanid to lay a claim to the Throne of Holy Amarr will be recognized as valid
    by the Privy Council and Theology Council. This was agreed in certain discussions
    I was party to yesterday. I have no doubt it will be formally agreed by the councils
    and proclaimed within days.\u201D\n\nDulsur was thunderstruck at this but managed
    to contain his astonishment. He nodded slowly and decided to attack.\n\n\u201CI
    see that the capacity of the pretender houses for blasphemy and heresy is undiminished
    even when it comes to their very own unholy interpolations into Scripture.\u201D\n\nSufrin
    was clearly pained by these words and looked at his two companions. The man remained
    impassive. The woman smiled and shrugged. Sufrin nodded and turned back to Dulsur.\n\n\u201CGrand
    Master, your Order figured heavily in the informal discussions between the Royal
    Houses and those others of us with some, let us say, influence in this matter.
    This was no idle fancy or bizarre gambit by any one house. It\u2019s true that
    there was disagreement but in the end the compromise was reached and you have
    your part to play in it.\u201D\n\n\u201CWe have our part to play in it? Do you
    actually have any idea what part the paladins of my Order would like to play in
    it, High Chaplain?\u201D\n\n\u201CI can well imagine,\u201D replied Sufrin drily.
    \u201CBe that as it may, little in this affair is palatable to anyone except perhaps
    our present host.\u201D Sufrin reached inside his robes and drew out a datapad.
    He glanced at it before sliding it along the table until it lay in reach of Dulsur.
    \u201CThis will explain everything.\u201D\n\nDulsur looked at the slim, book-sized
    object without making any move to touch it. \u201CWhat is this?\u201D\n\n\u201CThat
    is the Final Will and Testament of Her Imperial Majesty Jamyl I. Unredacted. It
    is a most important document and writing it may yet prove to be the most important
    act of our late lamented Empress.\u201D\n\nGrand Master Khemon Dulsur an-Tetrimon
    reached out and picked up the datapad, thumbing it on as he did. He read the contents
    in silence from beginning to end while the High Chaplain waited patiently. Finally
    he looked up, almost dazed, and turned the datapad off.\n\n\u201CYou bear witness
    to this as her rightful testament?\u201D Dulsur asked, his voice hoarse.\n\n\u201CI
    do and so does Pomik Haromi. Is there any more we need to discuss?\u201D\n\n\u201CNot
    here. I must return to Ibani and call a Council of the Chapters.\u201D\n\nThe
    High Chaplain nodded and stood up. \u201CThen you will play your part?\u201D\n\n\u201COn
    my own oath we will play our part. The Chapters will require persuasion.\u201D\n\n\u201CI
    have confidence that you will persuade them, Grand Master.\u201D\n\n\\***\n\n*Khanid
    Region, Molea System,*<br>\n*Apocalypse-class battleship,*<br>\n*OStT No Other
    Lord,*<br>\n*YC117.09.21*\n\nGrand Master Khemon Dulsur an-Tetrimon sat in his
    cabin thinking about the implications of what he had read in Jamyl Sarum\u2019s
    last testament. He still had the datapad in his hand and suddenly realized that
    unconsciously he\u2019d been gripping it tightly enough to hurt ever since leaving
    the meeting on the border post.\n\nDulsur stood up and went over to his cabin\u2019s
    reading desk. He carefully placed the datapad on the desk and picked up the book
    that was sitting there. Horm\u2019s copy of Tetrimon IV\u2019s \u2018Testament\u2019.
    Dulsur had carried it with him in memory of his mentor ever since the old man\u2019s
    death. He stroked the cover where the title was embossed before opening it and
    reading the frontispiece.\n\nHere in the privacy of his cabin, Dulsur was suddenly
    overcome with emotion and had to sit on his bed, holding the old book.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m
    sorry,\u201D whispered Khemon Dulsur an-Tetrimon.\n\nThe Grand Master opened the
    book again and began to read.\n\n~~~"
