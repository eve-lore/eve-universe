    call us \u201CKilm'ach.\u201D *The Lost.* We are the demons of their Scriptures.The
    Beast made real. We scare them, and they hate us for it. Or perhaps we simply
    remind them too much of the past. Of the heritage they\u2019ve forsaken and the
    people they betrayed. More likely, though, the Ammatar who live here hate us because
    we came to take their planet.\n\nWhatever the map says, New Eden ends at the borders
    of the great empire. Outside of the hisec systems, civilization does not exist.
    Not the way most people would like to believe anyway. Out here, you see the true
    face of humanity. And it is the face of madness.\n\nBy the time I arrive on Khabi
    VIII, a fringe planet in a highly contested corridor bordering Ammatar space,
    I have been in the Valklears for seven years. I\u2019ve paid for my training in
    scars and nightmares. The past is a glove-skinned awareness, barely felt. Old
    memories numbed by the fresh pain of new wounds. These days, I find the pain comforting,
    a convenient distraction. It might not be peace, but it\u2019s a good enough substitute.\n\nWe\u2019re
    moving slowly, stepping across a carpet of bodies. Tanvalin ghosts through my
    head. *This is what you do now? Kill civilians.* Through a series of small, interconnected
    rooms \u2013 scattered equipment, more dead scientists \u2013 labs by the look
    of it, and into a long, empty corridor: the perfect place to get shot. I motion
    for Neera to stay close, and together we crouch-run to the end of the corridor.
    We\u2019re halfway there when the door at the far end slides open. Neither of
    us misses a step. There\u2019s nowhere to go but forward, straight into whatever\u2019s
    waiting for us on the other side.\n\nInside, the rib-vault is twice as high as
    it is wide. Dirty light spills in through aging windows, filling the room with
    a sick, yellow glow. Cracks trace elaborate patterns across filigreed sections
    of the walls and floor, wrap around a statue, like decrepit fingers searching
    for something to strangle. Blood-red rust feeds on the faded gold surfaces. There
    is nothing quite as depressing as Amarrian architecture.\n\nWe move forward, glass
    shards from the shattered work terminals crunch under foot.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s
    beautiful,\u201D gasps Neera, either ignoring or having not seen the bodies, one
    of which is slumped at my feet, just inside the door. This must be what triggered
    it to open. *Poor bastard.*\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s a dead end. We should keep moving.\u201D\n\nBut
    Neera\u2019s not listening. She\u2019s lost in whatever place she goes to. The
    same empty look on her face from a few nights before as we sat outside enjoying
    the cool night air.\n\n\u201CWhat are we doing here?\u201D she asks. A light breeze
    tugs at her hair, dragging a rebellious strand across her harsh-boned face. Large,
    gray eyes stare through me, like distant stars shining in an ebony sky.\n\nFrom
    my puzzled look, she asks, \u201CHere. On this planet. Why are we fighting?\u201D\n\nI
    want to tell her that we have no choice, that we\u2019re just following orders.
    But the truth is that I don\u2019t care why we\u2019re fighting. And I don\u2019t
    want to stop. Because stopping means having to think. I say nothing.\n\n\u201COf
    all people, the Minmatar should understand the importance of freedom. We should
    know better. But here we are. At the end of the day we\u2019re just like everyone
    else. We take what we want and damn anyone that stands in our way.\u201D\n\n\u201CI
    don\u2019t think\u2014\u201C I start to say.\n\n\u201CNo! We\u2019re worse than
    everyone else!\u201D A flicker in her eyes. Rage maybe, or yearning. It\u2019s
    all I see in her eyes lately. \u201CAt least the Amarr have something to believe
    in. They work for the future, while the past defines everything we do. We use
    it to justify our actions. But we\u2019ll never be better than we are now, because
    we\u2019ll always be chained to what we once were.\u201D\n\n\u201CI want nothing
    to do with the past,\u201D I say, and mean it. \u201CBut what the Republic is
    doing is important. What *we\u2019re* doing is important. And as long as we keep
    doing it, the Republic will be free,\u201D I lie, wanting to make it better, to
    fix whatever\u2019s broken inside of her, and knowing that whatever I do, whatever
    I say, it\u2019s not enough.\n\nShe looks away from me then. \u201CYou\u2019re
    wrong. We\u2019ll never be free.\u201D\n\n\u201CWe\u2019ve got nothing, Sarge.\u201D
    Squawks my headset, snapping me back to the present and a room full of bodies.\n\n\u201CAlright.\u201D
    I reply. \u201CWe\u2019ll finish up here and meet you in twenty.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re
    the boss.\u201D\n\nShadows pool in the gaps between shafts of light. The darkness
    shifts, a twitch of alarm and the animal knowledge that something is watching.
    A wrong thing. Unseen, but felt on the edge of awareness. Watching. Waiting.\n\n\u201CC\u2019mon.
    We still have two more floors to check out.\u201D\n\nLeaving, we both glance back,
    each of us looking for something we\u2019ll never find.\n\nIt takes us hours to
    search the rest of the facility. We scour it room by room, but each one is the
    same. Dead bodies. No sign of the prototype. Occupation of the planet began months
    ago, and clearly, the fighting got here long before we did.\n\nI\u2019m almost
    ready to call it off when the dry cough of gunfire booms through the corridor.\n\n\u201CIn
    here!\u201D\n\nNeera\u2019s voice.\n\nI kick into a sprint, but Lesik is through
    the door first. There\u2019s another deep cough, and then a spray of gore blows
    back out into the passageway. Shredded tissue, long, wet strands of it, flies
    past my face and coats the wall opposite. Lesik, what\u2019s left of him, is dead
    before he hits the ground. I step over him, weapon tucked into the crook of my
    arm. And what I see stops me cold.\n\nNeera standing in the middle of the room.
    Daraket at her feet, wide-eyed, his hands tangled in his own viscera, the red
    of it gleaming brightly under the artificial lighting.\n\n\u201CI was hoping you\u2019d
    be first through the door. I thought that if I didn\u2019t see you, I could go
    through with it.\u201D\n\nHer words flush the adrenaline right out of me. My limbs
    suddenly feel very heavy. \u201CDrop the gun, Neera.\u201D\n\n\u201CI can make
    it better! I-I finally know what to do.\u201D\n\n\u201CDrop the gun, Neera. Please.\u201D\n\n\u201CDon\u2019t
    you want to know why I did it?\u201D \n\n\u201CThe \u2018why\u2019 doesn\u2019t
    matter. It\u2019s what you do that matters, whatever the reason. And you just
    killed two men.\u201D\n\n\u201CI freed them, chintaku.\u201D\n\n\u201CDon\u2019t
    call me that. Not anymore.\u201D\n\nShe stiffens at that. Then drops the gun and
    spreads her arms at her sides, palms open. To the casual observer it might look
    like surrender, but I know what the gesture really means. Have seen it a hundred
    times in the sparring chamber where we practice. It\u2019s a challenge. And I
    always accept. \n\nNeera is all soft technique, always has been. But she catches
    me with a backfist strike to the side of the head that seems to surprise her as
    much as it does me. She smiles then and for a moment she\u2019s the Neera of long
    ago. I smile back, in spite of myself. *This is insane.* Then draw my knife and
    drop into a combat stance. After that, things fall into a familiar rhythm. She
    moves like a liquid whirlwind. Punches slide off her as she slips in and around
    everything I throw her way. It looks effortless, but the sheen of fresh sweat
    betrays the concentration it requires.\n\nThe Sikan style she practices is all
    about redirection. Using the attacker\u2019s force against him. But I\u2019m giving
    her nothing to work with and the frustration is starting to show. She gets too
    eager and comes forward when she should be retreating. I catch her with a lateral
    chop that knocks her back, but even off-balance she falls into a leg sweep that
    catches me just above the ankle.I\u2019m back on my feet in a single motion, blocking
    and countering with adrenaline speed. We could go on like this forever, a geometric
    blur of limbs locked together for the rest of our days. Some part of me wishes
    that we would. The rest of me wonders how I\u2019m going to live without her.
    I make my decision and then wait for my chance.\n\nWhen it comes, I see it in
    the tilt of her shoulders, the subtle shift of her stance. The memory of it wired
    into muscles through countless hours of practice. I telegraph the move, knowing
    she\u2019ll see it and slide right by. Past my outstretched arm, hooking and then
    snapping my wrist, taking my weapon and then, while I\u2019m off-balance, killing
    me with it.\n\nThe moment spreads out in front of me. I lunge forward.\n\nExcept
    this time she doesn\u2019t move. The knife goes in easily. The cold knowledge
    of it shatters and pierces my heart. She pulls me close, a gasp escaping her lips
    as the knife slides deeper. I can feel the life beating out of her, warm and wet.
    She kisses me and I can taste her blood on my tongue.\n\n\u201CThank you, chintaku.\u201D
    *My love.*\n\nShe goes soft then, the weight of her sinking into my arms. I squeeze
    her tight, hoping that if I can just hold her close enough, that if I wait long
    enough, she\u2019ll open her eyes again. That everyone will stand up and together
    we\u2019ll walk outside, laughing and joking and everything will be like it was.
    As I wait, time falls away and I lose myself in grief.\n\nThe faint awareness
    of movement snaps me awake. Daraket\u2019s corpse stares accusingly at me. *You
    knew what she was. This is your fault.* Neera is lying on my chest, her arms around
    me like so many good mornings before. Suddenly, her grip tightens, and I feel
    the muscles in her neck stiffen as her head lifts itself and fixes me with gray,
    dead eyes. And a voice that isn\u2019t Neera\u2019s speaks from a face that is
    no longer hers.\n\n*\u201CWhy do you try to forget? Memories, Traveler. They\u2019re
    what make us who we are.\u201D*\n\nThe darkness swallows me."
