    planet Radonis lies deep within the Amarr Empire in the fiefdom of Ardishapur,
    one of the five royal families. Radonis is the capital of Ardishapur\u2019s domain
    and is considered one of the leading places of theological scholarship within
    the Amarr Empire.\n\nThe current head of the family and one of the Five Heirs,
    Yonis Ardishapur, had his right hand amputated at birth and replaced by a cybernetic
    silver one. It\u2019s the same for all male members of the Ardishapur family.
    For more than 700 years an imperial law has decreed that every male born into
    the Ardishapur family would have his right hand amputated at the wrist right after
    birth. The laws do not forbid them from replacing it with a cyber-hand and today
    the silver hand is the unofficial symbol of the Ardishapur family.\n\nThe circumstances
    which led to this imperial law are as bizarre as the law itself. As it happened,
    Lady Phanca, the mother of the emperor at the time, was visiting Radonis and staying
    at the Ardishapur\u2019s royal palace. Lady Phanca was a legend in her time; a
    strict, extremely ambitious woman, in many ways ruthless but still charismatic
    in her dealings with people. Many thought she had unnaturally strong influence
    on her son, the emperor, and many cases can be cited where the actions of the
    emperor can be directly linked to the wishes of his mother. The Ardishapur decree,
    as it became known as, is one of them.\n\nLady Phanca had a pet furrier, a small
    furry animal commonly found as pet among the Amarrian higher class. It was a well-known
    quirk that the otherwise severe and dispassionate lady loved her pet lavishly.
    When young Uri Ardishapur, son of the Ardishapur royal heir, killed the twittering
    creature at the dinner table, the fury of the old lady left no doubt in the minds
    of those present that the repercussions would be terrible. Persuading her son
    to pass the fore mentioned laws, Uri Ardishapur became the first of the Ardishapurs
    to lose his right hand, the hand that had slain lady Phanca\u2019s pet furrier.\n\nImperial
    laws are extremely strong within the Amarr Empire and are almost regarded as the
    written will of god. It is very rare for any of them to be changed or revoked.
    The Ardishapurs may at one time have wanted the law to be revoked, but today they
    revel in this old tradition and consider it one of their most important family
    heirlooms."
