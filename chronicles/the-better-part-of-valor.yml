    no one\u2019s gonna come down on me for this, right?\"\n\n\"Don\u2019t worry about
    a thing. The agency will cover your back legally, we\u2019ll assign a pseudonym,
    you\u2019ll be absolutely fine.\"\n\n\"Yeah. I just need to be sure there\u2019s
    absolutely no\u2026\"\n\n\"Mr. Sitsui. Remember what we talked about.\"\n\n\"I
    know, I know.\" The young man tugged absently at the dark tin figure-eight woven
    through both nostrils. The sight of his skin stretching made her nauseous.\n\n\"Okay,\"
    she said, with more finality than she felt. She fixed her gaze on the table between
    them. \"Whenever you\u2019re ready, go ahead and start from the beginning. If
    you want to reword something, just stop and say \u2018I\u2019d like to reword,
    please.\u2019 If you aren\u2019t sure you\u2019re remembering something correctly,
    it\u2019s very important that you mention that, even though you\u2019re going
    to give us the events as they transpired to the best of your recollection. All
    clear?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nShe leaned back in her chair and briefly
    thought about lighting a cigarette, then decided against it. Better to let them
    ease into it on their own. Wait until they find their feet in the story, then
    light the torch as a sign that everyone\u2019s at ease.\n\n\"Okay. So we\u2019re
    sitting there, there\u2019s about four of us...\"\n\n\"Wait. Start by telling
    me a bit about who you are. Sorry.\"\n\n\"Oh. Okay. I\u2019m Orin Sitsui. I\u2019m,
    uh, I\u2019m a materials tech for Caldari Constructions, here under service contract
    with Kaalakiota Second Command, currently on eighth year of service.\"\n\n\"All
    right, that\u2019s good. Thanks.\"\n\n\"Sure. So, yeah. Four of us, I think maybe
    five, but I\u2019m pretty sure four.\"\n\n\"This was where?\"\n\n\"In my section.
    The east ridge, level 55. My hab was in a real sweet spot, right next to the Syntact
    galleries and a row of restaurants. A small group of us who\u2019d been in training
    together, we used to always hang out there. And this time that I\u2019m talking
    about \u2013 we\u2019re all pretty new, you know, and most of us have never been
    exposed to how strict the regulations really are up here. I mean, we were told
    in training but I guess they didn\u2019t do a good enough job of hammering it
    in or something, because almost everyone I knew would have a story within like
    a week. One guy got trapped in the laundry room after hours and had to be rescued
    by maintenance drones. One guy wore a wristpiece that covered up a part of his
    ID derm and got zapped by his own doorway. Everybody was adjusting, you know?\"\n\nShe
    nodded, bunching up her toes inside her shoes. That cigarette was calling her.\n\n\"So,
    right. We\u2019re sitting in one of the places near my hab on a Wednesday afternoon,
    and we\u2019ve just finished a long bout of shifts so we\u2019re looking at four
    days off. We\u2019re drinking, you know, getting fast on cheap stimstickers \u2013
    yeah, legal ones, of course \u2013 and just having a good time, and then there\u2019s
    a commotion. Turns out there\u2019s a capsuleer coming through. Now, this was
    before the big boom, so eggers were ultra-rare. None of us had ever laid eyes
    on one.\n\n\"Turned out there wasn\u2019t much to see. He was really short. Dark
    hair, nondescript face. Civire, I\u2019m pretty sure. He had a contingent of Home
    Guard guys with him, real nasty pieces of work. You constantly heard about the
    Home Guard guys on the station. Infantry grunts, right? Signed up for war. Getting
    put on space station guard duty, for these guys, was like being told to cook and
    eat your own face. One of the guys in our section had a brother who was a Home
    Guard recruiter, and he said the guys who got assigned to the space stations were
    all being punished for insubordination, even if they did end up leading squadrons
    of the contract grunts. He said they joked that being a Station Sergeant was a
    demotion from Private.\n\n\"I really should have known better, I guess. Should
    have, I don\u2019t know, I should have put two and two together. But whatever.\"\n\nShe
    took the cigarette case from her pocket and nimbly fished one out, then placed
    it between her lips and lit it. Distantly he stared at the cherry of her flame
    for a few seconds.\n\n\"Would you like to take a break?\" she said. \"There\u2019s
    no rush. If this is hard for you to tell, we can wait a bit.\" She blew a column
    of smoke into the air-conditioned swirl above them.\n\n\"Nah,\" he said, leaning
    back in the chair and putting his hands on his knees. \"Nah, I\u2019m fine.\"
    He resumed his story.\n\n\"So I\u2019m quite lifted, you know? I got four days
    off, I\u2019m getting pretty loose off the stim-alcohol mix, and Janeira\u2019s
    on the other side of the table giving me all the right signals. And at one point
    I look over, and I make eye contact with one of the Home Guard guys.\n\n\"This
    guy had the weirdest look. He was staring right at me when I looked over, but
    still it felt like he couldn\u2019t see me somehow. At first I thought it was
    \u2018cause of my skin, since there aren\u2019t many halfbreeds like me running
    around on the upper decks. But then I realized it was because of the way I was
    sitting. I was sitting on the back of my chair with my feet on the seat, and station
    regs frown upon that, you see. I felt ridiculous suddenly, like a kid in a lunchroom
    who was about to catch a whack from the minder. And, I don\u2019t know, maybe
    that was exactly what made me do it, but out of nowhere I looked back at him and
    then pursed my lips in a little kiss.\n\n\"And just as I do it his eyes sort of
    widen a little bit, and Janeira notices me doing it and looks back, and when she
    sees who I just did it to she goes into this barely-subdued fit of laughter, and
    then the other people at the table catch on, and all the while the guy\u2019s
    just standing there, glaring back at me with the meanest god damn expression you
    ever saw. I felt this weird combination of fear and elation, like I was playing
    this danger game and it could go either way, you know, and I think I acted it
    too. But it was all for show, really. As soon as I made that air-kiss, something
    deep inside of me just went \u2018oh man, you did it now,\u2019 and this creeping
    sense of dread set in.\n\n\"So after staring at me for a few more seconds the
    guy breaks his gaze and goes back to looking around, guarding the egger guy, and
    the egger by this point is talking with another guy who\u2019s arrived at the
    table. Things are quiet for a few minutes, and I kind of stop worrying about that
    glare and start thinking I lucked out, you know, got away with it. And then suddenly
    there\u2019s this mad shuffle of movement, and the egger stands up and kind of
    stumbles back, and the guy he was talking to is just kind of sitting in his chair
    shaking, and something black and round falls from his hand, under the table.\n\n\"Took
    me a while to notice that the grunt who\u2019d been staring at me was holding
    out a little pistol-shaped thing in the guy\u2019s direction. He had this intense
    look of concentration on his face, but hateful too, like he was gonna end this
    guy right then and there. A couple of seconds pass and the guy\u2019s just sitting
    there, jiggling and foaming at the mouth, and all the grunts are just kind of
    staring, and I mean, us too, everybody in there is just staring at this guy get
    slowly roasted.\n\n\"Then all of a sudden the soldier stops and the guy just slumps
    forward on the table. The Home Guard guys go into this big huffing kind of secure-the-perimeter
    dance and one of them leads the egger away. We\u2019re just sitting there slack-jawed,
    looking at the whole thing unfold, right? And then I notice that, sure enough,
    the one who\u2019d been staring at me is making a beeline for our table, and my
    feeling of dread just comes powering back. We\u2019re all kind of rattled by the
    scene, so as he approaches we\u2019re sort of half-standing up. My friend was
    about to say something to him, but he just walks right up to me and grabs my arm.
    He\u2019s pretty flustered, like he doesn\u2019t know himself exactly what he\u2019s
    gonna do next, but there\u2019s this anger in his eyes, this absolute insane rage,
    you know?\n\n\"So he grabs my arm and I instinctively resist, right? I don\u2019t
    know what he wants with me, so I kinda pull my arm back and it makes him lose
    his balance momentarily. I start to say something, but just as I\u2019m starting
    the sentence he whirls around and just smacks \u2013 he\u2019s carrying this compact
    bullpup piece with a chromed handle-end , right, and he just smacks it right into
    the bridge of my nose.\n\n\"Now, I\u2019m no fighter. I grew up in a KK creche,
    never been in a scrap in my life, never had much interest in any of the fighting
    sports. So I guess up until that moment I had a pretty dim idea of what could
    happen and how bad it could be. Man, it was bad. First thing, my eyes just open
    up. I mean a full force torrent. I couldn\u2019t see anything. There was this
    disgusting crack, and I fell back down on the chair with this slick heat spreading
    all over my mouth and down my neck. I wanted to say or do something, but I was
    way too shocked to do anything but sit there and blink and sputter.\n\n\"Jaseira
    told me later that the guy took another look at everyone around the table, just
    sort of coldly took stock of the situation and then decided it was well within
    bounds to do it again, so he did. Twice. The second one made me black out, thankfully.\"\n\nShe
    regarded him with what she hoped was a compassionate look. He was tugging at his
    nose contraption again.\n\n\"I was too scared to register a complaint but I found
    out a couple days later that Jaseira had gone and done it anyway, behind my back.
    She was way more angry about the whole thing than I was. I guess maybe she felt
    partly responsible because she\u2019d laughed at the guy too.\n\n\"Anyway, we
    never saw him again. I got some kind of standardized letter of apology from their
    station commander a couple weeks later, but it didn\u2019t say anything about
    what they\u2019d done with him or whether they\u2019d even done anything at all.\"\n\n\"You\u2019re
    positive it was him?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yeah. I wouldn\u2019t have called you guys
    otherwise. I\u2019m not stupid. I know things have a way of getting out despite
    best intentions, and I know this isn\u2019t gonna make me very popular with the
    guy or his cronies. I just need the money. I\u2019m splitting.\"\n\n\"A few of
    you are, huh?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Just doesn\u2019t feel right around here anymore. I
    mean, we worked for the glory of the State before there was a big man at the top.
    We worked for the State because of what it represents. And there\u2019s one guy
    up there now with everything under his heel. What happened to the needs of the
    many outweighing the gains of the one? I mean, I like what he\u2019s doing, some
    of it anyway. The mood here is more optimstic than I\u2019ve ever seen it, and
    there\u2019s this really strong sense of purpose, but I just, I don\u2019t know.
    I guess I got my reservations about what kind of foundation it\u2019s all built
    on.\"\n\n\"Where are you gonna go?\"\n\n\"I\u2019d rather not talk about that,
    if it\u2019s all the same.\" He looked at her for a few seconds, then gave a rueful
    little half-smile.\n\n\"Okay,\" she said, giving the signal for the recorder to
    be shut off. \"Okay, well, I think we have everything we need. Your compensation
    should be in your account already. Thanks for your candor, Mr. Sitsui.\"\n\nIt
    was evening in the office-box of Executive Editor Harben Mullar, and outside its
    two small windows the studio assistants were busily disassembling the day\u2019s
    sets, tools whizzing and clicking under the artificial light. She was standing
    in front of his desk. Her finished piece was lying upon it.\n\n\"The story was
    corroborated by three of the four other witnesses. The girl has been relocated
    to a different part of the region. I wasn\u2019t able to get a hold of her.\"\n\nMullar
    didn\u2019t look at her. He drummed his fingers on the table. \"Okay,\" he said.\n\n\"Sitsui
    himself says he doesn\u2019t think the attack was racially motivated, but I think
    the story will speak for itself.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s funny. He has
    this ancient reconstructive wire-mesh thing in his nose. Vherokior tech from hundreds
    of years back. I asked him why he didn\u2019t just get it regrown. Said he needed
    the reminder to not do stupid things. All very dramatic.\"\n\nMullar nodded. Bi-di-dim,bi-di-dim,
    went his fingers on the table.\n\n\"Everything checks out. Heth was with the Home
    Guard at the time, and he\u2019d been assigned to the station in question just
    three weeks earlier. He was dismissed four months after the incident. The official
    reason was budget cuts, but this wasn\u2019t an isolated incident and I doubt
    his superiors could ignore that type of thing for very long.\"\n\nMullar ceased
    his tapping and leaned back in his chair. He sighed. \"I know it all checks out,\"
    he said. \"It\u2019s a good piece, Rekka.\"\n\nHis tone had a terribly familiar
    ring to it. She looked at him for a long while.\n\n\"No way, Harb,\" she began.\n\n\"Yup.
    Just got a call from Agency Central. They\u2019re redlighting the piece.\"\n\n\"No
    way, Harb,\" she said.\n\n\"Yup. Indefinite standby. Directive came from right
    up top.\"\n\n\"But it\u2019s a good piece. It\u2019s inbounds. It\u2019s not a
    bullet.\" Her voice was rising. \"I thought we agreed, we\u2019re just illustrating\u2026
    \"\n\n\"We agreed, Rekka, but you know as well as I do that if AC decides we can\u2019t
    run it, then we can\u2019t run it. It\u2019s out of my hands.\"\n\n\"Did they
    give a reason, at least? Or is it the usual need-to-know bullshit?\"\n\nMullar
    fished a cigarette out of his case. \"Take tomorrow off,\" he said, screwing it
    between his lips. \"There\u2019ll be time to talk after the weekend.\"\n\nShe
    stood there, staring at him. For a while she stared, as he clicked open a small
    lighter and briefly bathed the end of his cigarette in blue flame. He looked at
    her with resigned firmness and blew a plume of smoke into the space between them.\n\nShe
    turned on her heel and walked out.\n\nThe door shut on the office of Harben Mullar,
    and as it did the studio\u2019s lights winked out, one by one by one.\n"
