    the early days of the Caldari State, the eight corporate police forces of the
    Chief Executive Panel have played an important role in Caldari society. Figures
    of great public attention, reviled and worshiped in equal measure (often by the
    same person), these eight private militaries collectively match the official Caldari
    Army in numbers and far exceed it in training.\n\nWhat are these forces, how do
    they operate, and how did they come to be?\n\n### Necessity and Invention\n\nSome
    years after the dust of the Caldari-Gallente War had settled and the eight corporations
    of the Chief Executive Panel were getting acclimated to running an independent
    Caldari State, the issue of defense spending was raised at a national budget meeting.
    The Kaalakiota Corporation and the Sukuuvestaa Corporation were by this point
    well established as bitter competitors for the top of the revenue pile, and the
    subject spawned a heated debate between the two corporations\u2019 CEOs.\n\nThe
    passage of time had done little to diminish the Kaalakiota leadership\u2019s wartime
    alertness; they had long been advocates of increased military spending, particularly
    towards protection of assets in the homeland. The Sukuuvestaa, meanwhile, wanted
    the available funds diverted towards land partitioning on newly settled planets,
    reasoning that the creation of new assets was every bit as important as the protection
    of existing ones. That Kaalakiota dealt primarily in arms at the time, and Sukuuvestaa
    primarily in real estate, were topics not raised at the meeting.\n\nDue to the
    rivalry between the two the discussion soon escalated far beyond its purview,
    and what began as a simple debate swiftly turned into a heated argument rife with
    overtones of power struggle. The remaining executives of the CEP, uncomfortable
    with this potential disruption in the works, voted to momentarily shelve the topic.\n\nKaalakiota
    was not happy. Shortly after the meeting, they announced that the corporation
    would be bringing its own financial resources to bear in forming an independent
    internal security force, \"tasked with maintaining peace and order on all Kaalakiota
    holdings.\" This organization they called Home Guard, a name taken by the corporate-political
    community as a pointed reference to the dispute between the two leaders. Sukuuvestaa
    responded in kind by releasing a statement curtly announcing their intention to
    create their own military arm. In a direct jab at Kaalakiota, they named their
    force the \"Peace and Order Unit.\" The other mega-corporations, not to be outdone,
    soon followed suit. Within the year, all eight members of the Chief Executive
    Panel had either announced or begun formation of their own internal security forces.\n\n###
    Smoke and Mirrors\n\nFrom this bed of bluster sprouted the eight organizations
    known today as the Chief Executive Panel\u2019s faces of power. Equal parts propaganda
    tool and police force, the corporate forces are in many ways the most direct outward
    representation of their parent corporations\u2019 power, affluence, style and
    cultural significance. Seeking to capitalize on the relentless propaganda battle
    between the powers that be, Caldari entertainment interests have in recent years
    made very lucrative deals with these forces, hurling their desired images into
    the cultural zeitgeist in return for a slice of the profit pie.\n\nAvoiding direct
    competition in favor of finding their own niche, each of the eight has diversified
    into their own particular area. Spacelane Patrol, CBD\u2019s corporate force,
    is continually portrayed as a cadre of brash hotshots who travel from one corner
    of the universe to another on missions that usually involve much purposeful strutting
    around exotic locales. The Lai Dai Protection Service, meanwhile, are regularly
    shown to be a group of dashingly handsome tactical geniuses who devise complex
    original stratagems at the drop of a hat, usually under circumstances of extreme
    duress. Kaalakiota were the first to make this type of entertainment deal and
    have arguably been the most successful: Home Guard\u2019s image is second to none,
    not just among the corporate corps establishment but also in the popular cultures
    of all four empires.\n\nThe glossy tropes of the public relations holoreels and
    the beige glamour of stylized war worship stand in stark contrast to the reality
    of these agencies, but most people have only a muddy awareness of the dichotomy.
    A man can be rudely treated by a brusque and superior Ishukone Watch officer and
    silently curse him for hours, but as soon as he gets home that evening he is just
    as likely to prop his feet up and enjoy a rousing serial where the Ishukone Watch\u2019s
    superior technology and cunning allows it to root out Gurista spies and double-cross
    them into revealing their hideout. So pervasive is the propaganda that it is highly
    doubtful this man ever draws a parallel between the real thing and the image;
    the connection he draws, instead, is between the image and the mother corporation
    it represents.\n\nInternal Security, the Nugoeihuvi Corporation\u2019s force,
    poses a curious irony in this regard. Though the Nugoeihuvi conglomerate\u2019s
    main preoccupation is the entertainment industry, they have consistently failed
    to change the prevalent cultural image of their troops as a pack of rough-and-tumble
    thugs culled from the Caldari underworld, given to the grossest abuses and atrocities.
    It\u2019s very rare for elements of the Caldari State to find the rumor mill outgrinding
    them in their efforts at propaganda, but that\u2019s what\u2019s happening to
    Nugoeihuvi. (In reality, for the record, Nugoeihuvi\u2019s soldiers are not any
    more or less savage than those of the other corporate forces, though broadly speaking
    they have been noted to harbor a slightly greater proclivity toward drink and
    drugs.)\n\n### Cloak and Dagger\n\nOf course, the strong public relations utility
    of these forces does not mean that the good men and women that serve within them
    are mere puppets on a stage (though there exists, of course, a contingent of people
    willing to proclaim just that). It is an integral thing, for obvious practical
    reasons, that these militaries be proven without the shadow of a doubt to have
    aptitude in their profession. For this purpose a training summit is held each
    year at an undisclosed location, where the corporate forces lock horns in a series
    of combat- and survival-related challenges. This is the Haadoken Summit, and it
    is an event of great significance in Caldari culture.\n\nSince nominally none
    of the corporations want the results to get out, the proceedings carry a veneer
    of secrecy. Betting on the event is strictly illegal, but it nonetheless creates
    underground gambling revenue far exceeding that of any official State sporting
    or entertainment event. Despite ledger upon ledger of regulations and reprimands,
    information about the results is invariably leaked by someone in the winner\u2019s
    camp, and so it is in this crucible of competition that the holoreels, the slogans,
    the commercials and the claims are either gloriously validated or revealed as
    nothing but empty spectacle.\n\nThough nobody is ever declared deceased during
    the proceedings, it is a matter of public record that at least a dozen die each
    year and many more are injured (the families of the fallen receive standardized
    letters of condolence claiming their loved one has died in a training accident).
    Being essentially a contest between corporate ideologies played out in a quasi-military
    arena, the event touches many nerves in the Caldari soul, and its various obstacles
    and scenarios have been immortalized in countless holoreels and serials. The winners
    of the last three Haadoken summits have been the Ishukone Watch, whose level of
    training and tactical skill appears to be currently unmatched within the corporate
    forces.\n\n### Bread and Butter\n\nThese agencies also perform the more mundane
    duties of a mega-corporation\u2019s internal security force. They ceaselessly
    patrol the perimeters of their territories; they conduct counterstrikes against
    pirates and terrorists; and they are responsible for security on every ship, outpost,
    station, moon and planetside facility owned by their mother corporations. They
    are also granted legal authority to act as police proxies within corporate jurisdiction,
    though in all cases where regional police have a presence their authority supersedes
    that of the corporate police.\n\nCorporate forces are often criticized for their
    policework. Some of the more common accusations are gruff and uncaring demeanor,
    propensity for unnecessary violence, and lack of response time (particularly to
    non-acute, non-violent crimes). There is a simple reason for this: among the corporate
    forces, policework \u2013 which invariably involves dealing with the great unwashed
    masses \u2013 is seen as a lower-rung duty, a job for those unfit to serve in
    more of a military capacity.\n\nWorst of all is policework on space stations,
    which tend to be overcrowded with travellers from a staggering multitude of places,
    each possessing a different set of legal rights based on his nationality and organizational
    affiliation, and each of which is cranky and in a rush and probably sweating.
    Additionally, corporate interstellar law dictates that stations\u2019 rental offices
    and other commercial zones be segmented into a patchwork of diplomatic units,
    each with its own rules and regulations. Policework on stations therefore tends
    to be an affair fraught with jurisdictional pratfalls and covered in a tangled
    underbrush of red tape.\n\nTo their credit, corporate forces do have a well-deserved
    reputation for responding swiftly and decisively when circumstances truly call
    for it. If things get very bad very fast \u2013 if there is a hostage situation,
    if there is a large brawl, if there is some sort of large-scale accident or disaster
    \u2013 the corps will be there, fast, and they\u2019ll attack the problem with
    everything they\u2019ve got. People may grumble about rudeness and laziness and
    bureaucracy, but regardless they rest content in the knowledge that if a true
    crisis presents itself, they\u2019re in good hands.\n\n### Steel and Plasma\n\nAltercations
    between the corporate forces exist on record, but in almost every case they have
    been small incidents based on misunderstanding, with warning shots the only ordnance
    released. A notable exception is an incident known as the Ingalles incident, where
    soldiers belonging to the Wiyrkomi Peace Corps opened fire on a Hyasyoda convoy
    being escorted by the Hyasyoda\u2019s agency, the Corporate Police Force.\n\nThe
    Hyasyoda detail had received advance clearance for entry into the outpost, a high-tier
    classified Wiyrkomi research node buried in the shadow of a Citadel moon. They
    were to escort the CEO of a subsidiary of Hyasyoda\u2019s, Santra Alloys, to a
    meeting with a high-ranking Wiyrkomi scientist. The arrangement was legitimate
    (if unusual), but the Wiyrkomi Peace Corps saw incongruity in the direct meeting
    of a CEO and a scientist.\n\nThey stopped the convoy and conducted a heavy-handed
    interrogation. Due to a fatal combination of bad intel and jittery nerves, they
    then ended up attacking it, killing four people and destroying the reputation
    of their police force for years to come. (To this day, the Wiyrkomi Peace Corps
    are something of a laughing stock among the corporate forces, and to compound
    things they consistently place near the bottom of the yearly summit\u2019s scoreboards.)\n\n###
    Today and Tomorrow\n\nIt is unclear at this moment whether Tibus Heth, the Caldari
    State\u2019s newly instated Executor, has any specific plans for the corporate
    forces. It is considered likely, however, that he will try to gain control of
    them and use them for his ends if hostilities with the Gallente Federation escalate
    any further. Doing so will be easier said than done, as these organizations retain
    a great deal of power in the name of their public appeal, to say nothing of their
    competent and well-equipped soldiery. The allegiances of the complex network of
    sponsors, affiliates and marketers they associate with, however, are wholly unknown.\n\nDuring
    the invasion of Caldari Prime, all eight forces lent manpower to various aspects
    of the operation, from tactical strikes to civilian relocation, and the squadrons
    who participated have now mostly come back. Some scarred by atrocity, others whetted
    and ready for more, they are returning to their compatriots bearing tales of woe
    and grandeur on the blasted front. Where their loyalties will fall \u2013 and
    what sort of influence they\u2019ll spread \u2013 is anybody\u2019s guess.\n\nIf
    and when the time comes for Heth to begin making inroads, it remains to be seen
    what the CEOs of the Chief Executive Panel will do to hold on to these flagbearers
    of their outward image. One thing is certain, at any rate: whoever commands these
    forces controls a good deal more than just a group of men with guns. "
