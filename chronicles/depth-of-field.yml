    noise was getting louder, and the air was running out.\n\n\"What the hell was
    that thing?\" Now that there was nowhere to go, Karin couldn't stop herself from
    pacing.\n\nIt had torn through her ship's hull like it was tinfoil, exploding
    out into the vacuum. She'd seen it on the camera feed, bursting through the reinforced
    bulkheads of the central hold, and finally understood why Dagan had wanted a camera
    trained on a goddamn inert drone.\n\nGod, he was probably dead, too.\n\nOf course,
    he could come back. The rest of them weren't that lucky.\n\n\"You're so damn calm
    all of a sudden. You're gonna die, too, you know.\" Neral was quiet, leaning against
    the wall where Karin had arranged her. Her eyes were closed, but her breathing
    was shallow, her face sheet-pale.\n\n\"It seems quite likely, yes.\"\n\n\"Fucking
    Dagan,\" Karin muttered. \"I'm so sick of eggers.\"\n\n\"You'll be free of them
    soon enough, hmm?\"\n\n\"The hell is wrong with you?\"\n\n\"I've done what I had
    to do. There's nothing left.\"\n\nThe clang of metal on metal reverberated through
    the ship, over and over. Something was beating against the wall of their little
    harbor, and knowing what it was wasn't making her any more comfortable.\n\nIt
    was getting louder. She'd swear it was almost through the bulkhead.\n\n\"You need
    to know--\" Neral gasped. \"You need to know that they'll be coming for you now.
    They'll all be coming for you.\"\n\n\"Who? Who--\" Karin's words cut off, eyes
    widening as she saw Neral's gun. \"Are you crazy? You can't shoot that in here!\"\n\n\"Can.\"
    And the report filled the room.\n\nKarin slowly, cautiously opened her eyes. She
    looked over at where Neral had been sitting, then quickly looked away. She turned
    her face away from the ruin that had been Neral, and faced instead her own destruction.\n\nIt
    was almost through the door. It was--\n\n\"Hello! Anyone alive in there?\"\n\nCONCORD?\n\nHad
    she known?\n\n3.\n\nKarin dragged Neral along the hallway, her progress painfully
    slow. She'd found the woman with a chunk of shrapnel in her gut, and Karin couldn't
    just leave her lying there. Her ship was collapsing around her, nothing she could
    do about it, but she'd be damned if she was going to let her ethics go the same
    way.\n\nAnd now she was trapped in the twisted wreck of her ship with a dying
    woman.\n\nA dying woman and that noise.\n\nThe terrifying shriek of tortured metal
    and the groaning vibrations of the hull as it collapsed were bad enough, but it
    was the steady, metallic banging against the thinnest bulkhead of her accidental
    prison that was really freaking her out.\n\nShe really wanted to be thinking about
    something else.\n\nHer mind caught on a story from her childhood, of monsters
    in the depths of her homeworld's seas\u2014\n\nNo, that wasn't any better.\n\n--
    arms reaching out to strangle whole vessels, down under the weight of fathoms
    of water, death as certain as--\n\n\"Tahaki Karin,\" she thought, \"you snap out
    of it this instant.\"\n\nShe contemplated the bristling heap of metal shards ahead,
    bent and broken support beams and plates barricading what should have been a hallway.\n\nShe
    set Neral down gently, tried to slow her breathing. Normal. Do a mental inventory:
    What do you have on you?\n\nWrench, hammer, screwdriver, pliers--\n\nLeverage.\n\nShe
    could get some of the debris off one of the interior walls, find a way around,
    get them to a pod--\n\n--live through this.\n\n2.\n\nWhen everyone\u2019s eyes
    were glued to the security feed, watching Dagan\u2019s precious drone burst free
    from the ribs of their ship, it was Communications Officer Neral\u2019s voice
    they heard over the com.\n\nShe sounded just as calm telling them to abandon ship
    as she always had announcing an incoming transmission.\n\nIt made it all the more
    surreal when Karin discovered Neral bleeding out in the ship\u2019s corridor.\n\nShe\u2019d
    suffered a massive stomach wound, and judging by the trail she\u2019d left she\u2019d
    barely been able to pull herself over to the wall.\n\nKarin crouched by Neral\u2019s
    shoulder, reaching out to check her pulse, and nearly fell over when a sticky
    hand grabbed her arm.\n\nNeral\u2019s eyes opened, bright with fever. \"Dagan\u2026
    drone. Got to warn. My sisters. How?\"\n\n\"Hey,\" Karin said. \"Hey, it\u2019s
    okay, we\u2019ll get you out of this.\"\n\n\"Wasn\u2019t supposed to. Never expected.
    To get out.\" Neral laughed, short and horrifying, a thick wetness in her voice.
    \" Will now.\"\n\nNeral grabbed desperately at Karin\u2019s arms. \"They\u2019ll
    be coming after you now. They\u2019ll all be coming for you. Tell my sister\u2014\"\n\n\"You
    can tell her yourself,\" Karin said. \"I\u2019m going to lift you now, but it\u2019ll
    hurt. Brace yourself.\"\n\n1.\n\nDagan was on the line with her when the sirens
    started going off.\n\n\"Damn it,\" he said. \"This is far too soon. I thought
    that thing was thoroughly offline.\"\n\n\"The drone? It was! I checked it over
    when you brought it onboard.\"\n\nHe switched her view to the security feed. It
    was powering up weapons.\n\n\"I'm getting out of here. You'll probably want to
    evacuate, too,\" Dagan said, as her door slid shut and she heard the locks engage.
    \"Shame you won't make it.\"\n\nArrogant bastard, she thought, and headed for
    the ventilation ducts."
