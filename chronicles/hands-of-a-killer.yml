    are not the hands of a killer.\"\n\nAnd they weren\u2019t. Manicured to mechanical
    perfection, the nails polished immaculately, cut short at exactly two millimeters
    past the tip of the finger. Fingers that were slender, as far as male fingers
    can be. The wrinkles at the joints stood out, the only ones of their kind to be
    found on these hands. The skin itself was pale but smooth, like silk. Golden lines
    occasionally sparked underneath it like archaically patterned circuitry, as if
    to accentuate his choice of words. As he toyed absent-mindedly with the object
    he was holding, glimpses of his palms revealed that they too were soft, betraying
    a life free of the coarser obligations. He spoke again.\n\n\"Yet, we both know
    that I am. I have seen lives ended at the hands of enraged cattle, good people\u2019s
    shells stripped apart by inelegant tools of destruction. I have in turn killed
    this cattle, throwing their lifeless husks to the hungry void. I have fought enemies
    sheltered by walls they thought would keep them safe. I have imagined their screams
    in my mind. My lasers danced across their unshielded armor-stripped hulls exposing
    empty interiors to space and I smiled as they died.\"\n\n\"This is what you\u2019ll
    face. Madmen locked inside capsules, squandering lives as if they were nothing.
    When you are up there you are a tool, nothing more. A slave to the will of a pilot,
    bound to a man immortal until his mind can no longer be cloned.\"\n\n\"Mankind
    has taken to the stars and destruction has followed in its wake. Demigods patrol
    the lifeless expanse above, and they don\u2019t care about you. We are pilots.
    We control your destiny. When you are gone, we will live and we know this.\"\n\n\"These
    are not the hands of a killer,\" he said, looking squarely into the eyes of the
    young man across from him, \"but this is the face of one.\"\n\n\"Think carefully
    before you answer. If you decide to rise above your world and begin life among
    the stars, you will be nothing. You will be a drone in the hive of an insane Queen,
    existing solely to provide the ship with needs, links in a chain too complicated
    for you to understand. You will live this ungrateful life until the day you too
    will be floating, frozen, between distant suns.\"\n\nThe words were true, Daren
    knew that much. But his long-standing dream, of rising through the ranks aboard
    a battleship-class vessel - perhaps making it to Engineer, or even Chief Engineer
    - was all-consuming. He could not resist. The workers at the ground-docks had
    pointed him to a capsule-cleared pilot only after three months of harsh, unremitting
    labour. A conspiracy of fate and hard work had permitted him to meet with this
    Amarrian, who had needed but a brief look at him to know his aspirations.\n\nTaking
    a deep breath, Daren nodded and spoke the words that would condemn him: \"I understand.\"\n\nIn
    a fluid gesture, the pilot across from him slid the datapad he was holding across
    the table.\n\n\"Press your thumb on the pad and slide your IDImplant over the
    dotted line. Transfer will be booked. Keep the pad with you, it\u2019s your pass
    to my docks. Report to the quartermaster there; he will roster you in, arrange
    a bunk for you and explain to you your duties. Work hard and you\u2019ll be rewarded.
    There\u2019s no place for slackers on my decks.\"\n\n\"Now, if you\u2019ll excuse
    me, I have business deals to conclude.\"\n\nNodding his agreement, the young man
    left the table. Stunned, he made his way out of the establishment, holding the
    datapad tightly, as if his life depended on it.\n\nFour months later, Daren Athaksis
    was confirmed as one of six-thousand three-hundred and fourteen reported casualties
    resulting from the destruction of the Apocalypse-class battleship \"Dam-Imud.\"
    His post was filled within three days. His family was not notified."
