    name of Tyma Raitaru will forever be associated with the term freelance research.
    Raitaru, a Caldari by birth, pioneered what has today become a popular profession
    among rogue scientists and scholars around the world of EVE - that of the knowledge
    nomad, selling his work to the highest bidder.\n\nRaitaru began his career working
    in the R&D department at a company owned by the Ishukone Corporation. He became
    increasingly frustrated about the fact that Ishukone took all his work and inventions
    and made them their own, giving scant credit to the creator. In the end he left
    and set up his own laboratory under his sole control. There he struggled for some
    years, constantly on the brink of financial ruin. It was only when he turned his
    focus toward the most practical of all inventions - that of weaponry - that his
    career really took off. Forty years ago Raitaru offered the blueprints for the
    Achilles missile for sale on the open market. \n\nThe Achilles missile was at
    that time the best missile available and every empire and every faction wanted
    it. The Achilles missile didn\u2019t employ any revolutionary new technology,
    but instead it combined many solid concepts and designs to make it extremely reliable
    and powerful for a small price. In the design of Achilles Raitaru combined the
    innovative approach of the researcher with the practical mindset of the craftsman.
    Ever since, those that have followed in Raitaru\u2019s footsteps have been most
    successful when they take existing technologies and products and combine them
    to invent some superior product. Most of today\u2019s freelance researchers work
    predominantly in the fields of weapons and ship equipment, and they frequently
    operate out of space stations or lone research outposts.\n"
