    vast Amarr plantations on Syrikos V have used slaves as workforce for centuries.
    Scores of Ealurians, Minmatars, Ni-Kunnis and criminals or political dissenters
    of Amarrian origin have worked, bred and died by the millions through the ages.\n\nThe
    droves of slaves needed to work the fields coupled with the high mortality rate
    means that elaborate methods of keeping the slaves in check, such as Vitoc, are
    not cost efficient enough to warrant their usage. Instead, the Amarrians employ
    slaver, sometimes referred to as slave-dog.\n\nSlaver is a native animal of Syrikos
    V and has been bred by the Amarrians from the time they first settled the planet
    more than a millennium ago. It\u2019s a vertebrate with four elongated feet and
    a slender, fur-clad body. A fully grown slaver can stand more than a meter tall
    from its shoulder-blades to the soles of its front legs. But the most noticeable
    feature of the slaver are its massive jaws and teeth, constantly slobbering in
    anticipation for something to chew on - hence the old name of the slaver before
    its role as slave keeper: Drooler. The slaver can run very fast and is able to
    jump vast distances, making this carnivorous beast a deadly foe against unarmed
    humans.\n\nSlavers are extremely vicious and blood-thirsty, but they can be tamed
    as long as the training starts while they\u2019re still small cubs. The slavers
    are allowed to roam free outside the barbed parameters of the acres of the plantations.
    The agile slavers are quick to see or smell slaves that have ventured outside
    the fences and few can escape the slavers quick, merciless attacks. A preferred
    tactic of the slaver is to attack from above; for this it often lurks in high
    places, even trees, or by simply jumping many meters into the air and landing
    on their unsuspecting prey.\n\nThe favorable experience of employing the slaver
    as a guard animal has led to it being exported from Syrikos V to most other Amarrian
    agricultural planets and even some industrial and mining ones as well. In recent
    years, the slaver has become fashionable among Amarrians as pet for those willing
    to risk its often murderous nature; slavers can become extremely loyal and devoted
    to their owners if handled with care."
