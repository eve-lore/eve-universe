    of the numerous operations jointly run and organized by the empires is the InterBus.
    The InterBus is a transportation organization responsible for ferrying people
    between space stations. The company was formed three decades ago with the intent
    to support and facilitate passenger transportation in space. At that time such
    a company was sorely needed, but the huge initial cost of entering the field made
    it hard for private companies to move into the field. Today, this has changed;
    there are now a number of independent companies engaged in ferrying people between
    space stations, the biggest of them is the Gallente-run OmniBus company.\n\nBut
    InterBus still enjoys the largest market share by a fair margin, something the
    private companies are not all that happy about; grumbling about unhealthy state-intrusion
    that makes competition very lopsided. The InterBus may be child of its time but
    it still serves a vital role - that is to link even the smallest and most remote
    stations into their vast network. As stated in InterBus\u2019 charter:\n\n*\"...Interbus
    must offer service to all stations, placed in solar-systems that have a stargate
    leading to a solar-system that is a part of the program. Exempt to this rule are
    systems that exceed a graph distance of 13 jumps from the Interbus headquarters...\"*\n\nIn
    order to do this efficiently InterBus has had to tread a fine line between serving
    their governments faithfully while at the same time establishing trust with all
    the motley assortment of stations appearing all over the place. The board of the
    InterBus has successfully managed to stay clear of any quarrels and conflicts
    that regularly emerge between the empires or other factions. The result is that
    even if InterBus isn\u2019t exactly welcomed with open arms everywhere, they\u2019re
    still perceived as useful and neutral enough to be allowed to operate.\n\nThe
    InterBus system, spanning almost the whole of the known world, is both a cheap,
    reliable transportation method for those without access to other space ships and
    a safety net for all space travelers that get in trouble - many careless explorers
    or unlucky merchants would never have made it home if it weren\u2019t for the
    service of the InterBus."
