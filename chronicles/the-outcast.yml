    poignant tale of the Outcast is a stark reminder that no one people in the pocket
    universe of New Eden are without sin or blame. Even the Minmatar, beleaguered
    underdogs of the four great nations and subjects of many a Gallente charity drive
    or human rights protest, have their own shameful taint, which they above all are
    reluctant to admit or acknowledge.\n\nStill deeply rooted in tribal folklore and
    steeped in tradition, the Minmatar often attract scorn for the seemingly barbaric
    rituals they cling on to; the Voluval, that most integral of ceremonies, chief
    among them. While it is clearly the most influential and important ritual to a
    young Matari, it carries with it a terrible burden often swept under the carpet
    by shamans and spokesmen of the tribal faith. After all, if the fact that those
    who would fight most fiercely for freedom, would also readily oppress a fragment
    of their own populace, became known to the public at large \u2013 it would surely
    cut the legs out from under any lucrative charity effort.\n\nThe broken shield,
    the pale eye, the Slaver\u2019s fang. These dread markings, while thankfully rare,
    are an inevitable by-product of the unpredictable genetic lottery involved in
    the marking ritual. Some force a Voluval subject into a self-imposed lifetime
    vow of silence under the penalty of having his tongue cut out by his kin should
    he or she ever break it \u2013 others, like the dreaded pale eye, condemn the
    unfortunate young tribesman to exile, though exile is usually the path chosen
    by those cursed by a foul tattoo regardless of the penalty it carries. What precisely
    happens to these tormented children of rage is known by few, and spoken of by
    fewer \u2013 even the liberal Gallenteans, always eager for a good cause to leap
    upon like lampreys and saturate their media with, have never heard of Vo\u2019shun.\n\nVo\u2019shun,
    or \u2018Hidden Hope\u2019, lies on the devastated homeworld of the extinct Starkmanir
    tribe, once called Starkman Prime but now largely forgotten. It is a sprawling
    complex of rust and girder, a veritable shanty-town of interconnected, self-contained
    habitat modules built in a man-made geological feature known as Sorrow\u2019s
    Gash \u2013 man-made, because four hundred years prior, an Amarr orbital bombardment
    fleet gored this hundred mile canyon in the face of Starkman Prime\u2019s largest
    continent with their ravening tachyon siege lasers. There, among smouldering sulphur
    volcanoes, surfing a fractured tectonic plate, dwells the only sanctuary the Outcast
    can call home.\n\nThere is but one law in Vo\u2019shun: no one is turned away.
    Ruled entirely by tribal law adapted and modified from Minmatar folklore, the
    colony is a mishmash of utter savagery and social enlightenment the Republic quietly
    envies. Murder is more than common, suicide is rampant, but above all the people
    of Vo\u2019shun know freedom. Those stained with the Slaver\u2019s fang can sing
    war songs rather than be condemned to a lifetime of silence; those marked with
    the pale eye can live among kin.\n\nThe Sisters of Eve attempt regular clandestine
    aid shipments to Hidden Hope, which exists in a state of near-poverty. Due to
    Starkman Prime\u2019s location in the Arzad system \u2013 a disputed border zone
    between the Minmatar and the Amarr \u2013 many of these shipments are interdicted,
    which in turn forces the Outcast to turn to piracy. While the Amarr Navy is brutally
    efficient at curbing Outcast raids, the only reasons the Empire has not allowed
    slave raiders to invade Vo\u2019shun, is an eagerly perpetuated and not altogether
    false rumour that the colony is rife with communicable diseases that render its
    populace unsuitable for enslavement \u2013 and, unbeknownst to the bedraggled
    citizens of Hidden Hope, a curious edict put into law by Idonis Ardishapur himself,
    whose royal family has domain over Starkman Prime. Enacted shortly after Ardishapur
    scouts stumbled upon Vo\u2019shun a mere decade ago, the edict, not widely publicized
    or even understood by imperial lawyers \u2013 yet tacitly enforced nonetheless
    \u2013 states unconditionally that no further harm shall directly befall this
    shattered world.\n\nThis edict\u2019s name: Khadrea\u2019s Law."
