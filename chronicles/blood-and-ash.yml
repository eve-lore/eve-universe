    watched as Imperial Major Shayiskhun stooped and trailed his fingers through the
    cooling remains of the funeral pyre. The Major straightened and solemnly rubbed
    the ashes he\u2019d collected into a cut on his forearm. The eyes of the assembled
    Kameiras were bright with emotion and pride as the Amarr officer took part in
    a ceremony so sacred to them, yet so frowned on by the Imperial command. Shayiskhun
    had become an officer in the Kameira corps as a Cardinal Lieutenant, and like
    any Amarr officer new to commanding the Kameiras, he had been appalled by the
    sight of soldiers in the Imperial Army rubbing the ashes of the fallen into their
    wounds. Some officers never got over their distaste for the ritual. Most quickly
    learned to tolerate and even appreciate it as a critical means of maintaining
    morale and unity in Kameira units.\n\nMajor Shayiskhun was that rarity, an officer
    of the ancient Amarr bloodline who took part in the ceremony itself. In a way,
    Hemah mused to himself, Shayiskhun did the fallen even more honor than the Kameiras
    themselves. It was one thing for the Imperial authorities to turn a blind eye
    to the Minmatar slave troops performing profane funeral rites, but quite another
    if an Amarr officer took part. Shayiskhun, though, was a hero, and his troops
    famed throughout the military. The regulars called them \u201CShayiskhun\u2019s
    Avengers.\u201D The Kameiras called themselves \u201CSons of Shayiskhun\u201D
    and left it at that.\n\nHemah thought back to the first battle after Shayiskhun
    had taken command of Hemah\u2019s platoon. It had been a hard one, for them all.\n\n<div
    align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\n\u201CSecond Hemah!
    Take two men and secure building C32!\u201D Lieutenant Shayiskhun shouted over
    the deafening roar of the battle, a sound of intermingled vehicle noise, weapons
    fire, explosions, and the screaming of dropships flying to and fro. In fact, to
    call it a \u201Csound\u201D would be a pathetic understatement \u2014 rather,
    it was a mailed glove of noise and vibration that crushed the senses in its grip.
    It was battle. War.\n\nHemah raised his hand in acknowledgement and signed to
    Rinah and Omaristos in their unit\u2019s battle language. The three men got up
    into a running crouch and moved down the street toward building C32, which had
    once been three stories high but now showed the empty windows of only one floor,
    the jagged teeth of the upper floors protruding at one corner. \n\nImmediately,
    out of the background noise of the battle, the sound of small arms fire erupted,
    sharp and deadly close. The ground around them showed impacts as the incoming
    weapon fire tracked them. Hemah, in the lead, signed quickly and dove for cover
    in the remains of the adjacent building, flattened to nothing only the day before.
    Rinah and Omaristos leapt after him into the shelter of a bank of rubble, checking
    themselves for wounds as soon as they were in cover.\n\nHemah looked around. The
    leveled block showed no immediate dangers, and the buildings to the rear were
    under friendly control. The enemy was somewhere ahead. At least that much was
    simple. Their objective, C32, seemed quiet, but something told him enemies were
    present. Waiting. He studied the walls and saw that blast damage had weakened
    a large section of the side of the building. That would be their entrance. Omaristos
    carried a force charge launcher, the so-called \u201Cbubble gun,\u201D capable
    of clearing minefields, field obstacles, and much else besides. Hemah signed,
    and the big warrior, huge even for a Kameira \u2014 surely a purebred Brutor \u2014unslung
    the launcher and crept along the bank of rubble.\n\nReaching a convenient break,
    Omaristos raised himself to a kneeling position, shouldered the launcher, and
    took aim. An instant after the kick of the launcher firing, a shimmering field
    of force two meters across snapped into existence for a split second, before winking
    out. Out of a cloud of dust and debris pushed into the air by the force field,
    a hole appeared in the side of the building. Omaristos immediately leapt up, slinging
    the launcher and drawing his short combat glaive in one movement as he ran for
    the opening. Hemah and Rinah had followed him to the firing position at a crouch
    and were running behind him with weapons at the ready. Hemah had his own glaive
    in one hand and his ionic pistol in the other; Rinah favored his shotgun with
    the heavy-studded choke.\n\nBursting through the settling dust cloud, Hemah was
    just in time to see Omaristos thrown to the side by a grenade blast. Without stopping
    to check on his comrade, Hemah charged at the doorway, glaive held low, and gutted
    the rebel soldier crouching there as the man tried to bring a laser carbine to
    bear. Kicking the corpse to one side, Hemah backed into the doorjamb and brought
    out one of his own grenades: a monofilament special. He primed and tossed the
    grenade back down the corridor before turning back into the entry room and pinging
    Rinah, who was checking on their big comrade.\n\nRinah looked up, anger etched
    on his face, and shook his head, his long braids swinging about his ears. The
    combat medic chopped out some battle language and turned back to the corpse of
    their comrade, quickly removing useful items. The monofilament grenade detonated
    as Hemah absorbed what Rinah had signed. A frag splinter painted with neurotoxin
    had taken Omaristos in the face. He hadn\u2019t stood a chance. Hemah was lucky
    to have avoided the blast.\n\nHemah pinged Rinah again and, crouching low, went
    through the doorway, knowing the medic would be following. The air was just clearing
    from the devastation caused by hundreds of monofilament wire pieces scything through
    the air. Hemah rushed forward with pistol and glaive, leaping over the remains
    of the rebels at the end of the corridor and into the next room. \n\nHe spotted
    movement and fired a 3-shot burst of ionized lithium in its direction, then dove
    again for cover. Rinah followed and his shotgun roared death over that quarter
    of the room. \n\nHemah saw that Rinah moved forward, and left cover to parallel
    him. A wounded rebel had been crawling to a window. The rebel had been clipped
    by Hemah\u2019s fire, and the back of his head was blasted open by Rinah\u2019s
    heavy shot load. They checked the next two rooms quickly, but they were empty.
    Building C32 was secure.\nAnd Omaristos was dead.\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nHemah
    thought back on that battle and its aftermath as he watched man after man step
    up to the pyre and take on the ashes of the fallen. After that day\u2019s fighting,
    the rebels who had followed the Fifty Tyrants threw down their arms in hope of
    mercy. They received only the mercy of a quick execution for their surrender.
    The planetary capital had been taken by storm because it was too valuable a resource
    to destroy. A randomly-selected provincial city was not so fortunate. Its inhabitants
    were given a day to evacuate before it was bombarded into white-hot slag by Revelation-class
    dreadnoughts. The Fifty Tyrants, at least those dozen who had not already been
    killed or committed suicide, were tortured to death in front of the planet\u2019s
    loyal holders. The Empire always made sure to teach by example in such cases.\n\nCardinal
    Lieutenant Shayiskhun had led his men to such good effect that an entire city
    district had been secured by nightfall. Omaristos had not been the only Kameira
    to fall that day. Fully a third of Shayiskhun\u2019s platoon had been killed,
    and the entire corps presence in the city had lost a quarter of its strength.
    The Tyrants had received a lot of help from someone, perhaps from one of the Empire\u2019s
    rivals for dominance of the stars.\n\nBut they had not prevailed, and the Kameiras
    honored their fallen as after any battle. Shayiskhun had seen his first ash ceremony
    after another officer\u2019s unit had returned from a skirmish. This time his
    own men had fallen, and the Kameiras of his platoon noted with gruff approval
    a change in the attitude of the young officer that night.\n\nHemah was brought
    back to the present with a jolt as the man next to him moved forward to the pyre.
    Today\u2019s battle had not been like the Battle of the Fifty Tyrants. The Sons
    of Shayiskhun had been sent to clear out a heretic nest in the depths of the space
    station they happened to be using as a transit base. It was a matter of convenience
    rather than needing Kameiras to do the job. But the heretics had been dangerous
    enough, and a sniper had claimed two of them. \n\nOne of the fallen was Rinah.\n\nHemah
    stepped up to the pyre as the previous man stepped away, and looked down at the
    ashes a moment, remembering once again. Omaristos had been his friend in Junior
    Subigo, after they\u2019d gone through the final human endurance program treatments
    in the cr\xE8che. His death had been a hard blow. Rinah here, well, Rinah had
    got him through Senior Subigo. The man had already become a medical adept by then.
    Rinah had healed a break in Hemah\u2019s leg that would probably have led to his
    death during an extended live combat trial out in the wilds of their training
    planet. This death was another blow.\n\nHemah stooped as the major had and, cupping
    his fingers, scooped up the ash and rubbed it into his bare chest. He\u2019d taken
    no wound today, so he had sliced open a stretch of skin over his breastbone. He
    took on the ashes of Rinah and of Amilpur, the other fallen Kameira, just as he\u2019d
    taken on the ashes of Omaristos so long ago. They were with him forever now, his
    comrades. Their loss was heavy, but the Sons of Shayiskhun would endure and continue
    to conquer in the Empire\u2019s name.\n"
