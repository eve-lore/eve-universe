    Kovalis stepped out of his ready room still fiddling with the seal-tight fastener
    on his capsule suit. He looked at his watch then remembered he wasn't wearing
    one. After all, he was in his capsule suit. For a capsuleer, Zakari was both old-fashioned
    and somewhat absent-minded, particularly outside the element that was, if not
    exactly natural, the one he\u02BCd made his own: the ultraconnected, fluid-filled
    world of the capsule. By an act of will he brought up the time readout in its
    customary corner of his inner vision. Just past noon, plenty of time.\n\nZakari\u02BCs
    ready room was close by the secure hangar bay that his ship rested in and he passed
    through the internal lock to the bay a few minutes later. There she was, the Katydid,
    his ship and his real home. The Cheetah class frigate was still swaddled by service
    gantries but her lines were clear enough. The ship\u02BCs weathered but distinctive
    Thukker colors made a contrast with the advanced connectors and special equipment
    being run into and alongside her. Zakari shook his head slightly and stepped down
    from the lock entrance to the hangar floor.\n\nThe Cheetah class frigates were
    developed by the Thukker tribe, Zakari\u02BCs own people, as a flexible platform
    for covert operations, reconnaissance, and exploration duties. The Katydid was
    currently rigged as a deep-space exploration vessel. Zakari could see a few technicians
    huddled around the consoles that controlled the tuning of the scanner probe packages.
    Right in the middle of them was Taya Akira, one of the Sanctuary School\u02BCs
    experts on unstable, yet traversable, wormholes. Zakari smiled to himself and
    walked over to the island of consoles.\n\n\u201CStill arguing about how narrow
    a range of resonance frequencies in exahertz the probes should be tuned to or
    whatever it is?\u201D asked Zakari as he caught Taya Akira\u02BCs eye. The young
    Sisters of EVE scientist rolled her eyes and waved him away. Zakari smiled and
    watched her a moment longer before strolling toward the ship. He didn\u02BCt need
    to know the fine details; he launched the probes and set their search patterns.
    He had a good eye for narrowing in on probe hits but setting up these custom-scanning
    packages was not his field at all.\n\nThe Katydid\u02BCs engineering section was
    accessible via a gantry and he decided to go in that way. Inside, he nodded to
    his flight engineer, Jubal Hrada, a taciturn man of vast experience drawn from
    working on many different ships in the Vo-Lakat caravan\u02BCs exploration fleet.\n\n\u201CHow\u02BCs
    it going, Jubal?\u201D\n\n\u201CShe\u02BCll fly, Zakari.\u201D\n\nZakari nodded
    and left the engineer to it. Jubal Hrada had lost a lot of family when the Lakat-Hro
    Great Caravan disappeared back during the unstable wormholes incident of YC111.
    In a sense, everyone in the Vo-Lakat caravan, an offshoot of the larger nomadic
    fleet, had lost family. Jubal's loss was a lot closer to home though. He'd still
    been Lakat-Hro at the time, just jobbing with the Vo-Lakat. His wife and children
    went missing with all the rest when the Lakat-Hro fleet disappeared in the SL-YBS
    system at the same time its star suffered a \"main sequence anomaly.\"\n\nZakari
    had been to SL-YBS with the other searchers and seen what was left of the first
    planet. He was of the considered opinion that \"main sequence anomaly\" was putting
    what had happened pretty mildly. The disappearance of the mother caravan in that
    star system was only the beginning of a great upheaval for the Vo-Lakat. The caravan
    took in the scattered surviving members of the Lakat-Hro as a matter of course.\n\nLeaving
    engineering, Zakari went up to the crew area to make sure everything was in order.
    The ship had been modified a lot over the years and was equipped to carry specialist
    expedition teams alongside the small ship\u2019s crew.\n\nThe crew proper amounted
    to Jubal and whoever shipped with them as a tech for the mission. A woman named
    Ava Sosek had come out to the Sanctuary with them on this job. She was an astrometrics
    tech and very experienced in the data analysis side of that work. Zakari and his
    automated systems took care of the rest of the ship\u2019s business. The capsule
    interface typically cut out crew requirements onboard frigates, unless skilled
    personnel were required for a specific sortie.\n\nThe Sisters were covering the
    expedition team side of things, as well as providing a wormhole-mapping specialist.
    Which was where Taya came in. Zakari glanced down the corridor leading to the
    sleeping quarters. He smiled wryly and continued forward. He especially wanted
    to check the survey command center in the prow.\n\nThe Katydid was an old mark
    of the Cheetah class and Zakari had piloted it in service of the Vo-Lakat exploratory
    corps for several years. The prow of the Katydid contained a lot of custom sensor
    equipment but its standout feature was the enlarged command center. You had to
    reach it through a crawl-way, but there was room in there for two.\n\nThe main
    purpose of the center was coordination of survey and exploration missions, particularly
    those involving expedition teams. As far as Zakari knew, Taya would be up here
    on her own, just as she had been on the last five runs. The Sanctuary scientist
    and her team operated on the basis that she was in charge as far as Zakari could
    tell.\n\nZakari looked around the cramped space, checked the diagnostics on the
    armored shutters closed over the sapphire glass viewports. He shook his head.
    Being a capsuleer could have some strange psychological effects including a paradoxical
    hybrid of agoraphobia and claustrophobia. Zakari suspected he had a mild case
    of it. Zakari glanced at the crawl-way light\u2014it was out, nobody coming up\u2014and
    set off back down towardsthe ship\u2019s core.\n\nZakari quickly made his way
    to the crew embarkation lock, cycled through, and rode the gantry elevator down
    to the hangar floor. He looked over at the consoles again, saw Taya and the technicians
    were still hard at it, and walked back across.\n\n\u201CThe Katydid\u2019s ready
    to fly, Taya. I\u2019ll be going under and loading up in ten minutes.\u201D\n\nTaya
    Akira looked up blankly, nodded shortly after visibly replaying his words in her
    mind, and bent back to her work. Zakari shrugged to himself and headed for the
    hangar\u2019s capsule gantry.\n\n\\***\n\n__The Sanctuary School, X-7OMU II M7,\nCheetah
    class frigate Katydid,\nYC112.07.07__\n\nLying back in the encapsulation prep
    couch, Zakari smiled to himself as he pondered the inscrutable Sister Taya. Smart
    connectors locked into his spinal implants and the skeletal couch raised him up
    into the waiting capsule where a series of handler arms gently took hold of him.
    The couch withdrew, the smart connectors pulled in most of their slack, and the
    capsule sealed itself.\n\nZakari took a breath, and then exhaled steadily, emptying
    his lungs as the capsule fluid poured in. He held his breath until the hyperoxygenated
    suspension fluid covered his head, and then inhaled deeply. His adapted throat
    and nose tissues responded to specific chemical cues in the fluid to suppress
    the usual reflexes that would resist water entering the windpipe. In a heart's
    beat he was breathing the fluid as calmly and easily as he would breathe air.\n\nWhen
    the capsule's internal monitors confirmed that all was well with Zakari's vitals
    after the respiratory transition, the gantry's handling mechanisms lifted the
    great egg-shaped fusion of man and machine up and toward the waiting capsule port
    of the Katydid. The large port behind the bulky \"sail\" of the ship accepted
    the capsule and the ship's internal handlers took over, guiding the precious cargo
    inside. Behind it multiple bulkheads sealed off and the outer port closed as a
    heavily armored door swung home and locked itself into place with internal bolts.\n\nZakari
    became one with the ship, in a way that nobody but another capsuleer could truly
    appreciate; his body sense fell away and the ship sense came over him. The capsule
    had completed its connection routines and was now enclosed in a sheath of armor
    within this most central of chambers.\n\nZakari's biological systems were now
    profoundly connected and integrated with the Katydid. In a sense, a very real
    sense, Zakari Kovalis was now a Cheetah class covert operations frigate called
    the Katydid.\n\nZakari sent the ready signal and opened a channel to speak to
    Sister Taya Akira. Or rather, Zakari's will to speak to the Sanctuary scientist
    was translated into the Katydid's comms connecting with Taya's aural implant and
    converting his thoughts into words that she seemed to hear as if from an earphone.\n\n\u201CReady
    to go, Sister Taya. Finished up with the scanner packages yet?\u201D\n\n\u201CWe\u2019re
    done here. The team is boarding now. Mission parameters are unchanged. Launch
    at your discretion, Captain Kovalis.\u201D\n\n\u201CUnderstood.\u201D\n\nZakari
    watched through his ship sensors as the Sanctuary expedition team filed into the
    crew area and made ready for launch. Taya was on her way to the prow command center,
    which was typical, as much as he didn\u2019t like her being in the crawlspace
    during launch. He decided to wait until she was in the command center before launching.\n\nWhen
    Taya had settled into her station, Zakari fired up the engines, increasing power
    to the deflection fields to lift the ship as low pulses of main engine power propelled
    the ship forward and out to the exit channel. Navigating freely now, the Katydid
    headed for the primary exit port, pinging a formal departure handshake to one
    of the station\u2019s flight controllers in passing.\n\nThe frigate powered out
    of the station and immediately began to align on a heading to a specific location
    within the X-7OMU system. Katydid entered warp moments after lining up with the
    target coordinates and accelerated to several AU per second for a short coast
    before decelerating. The ship dropped out of warp after barely a minute of faster-than-light
    travel.\n\nZakari launched a full spread of scanner probes while putting the ship
    into a random alignment away from the previous line of travel. He activated the
    ship\u2019s cloaking device as soon as the probes were launched and set to work
    coordinating the probes in a pattern designed to locate unstable wormholes as
    quickly as possible.\n\n\u201CProbes are away. We are under cloak. Scanning sequence
    begins now,\u201D sent Zakari to Taya Akira.\n\n\u201CUnderstood. Probe packages
    are performing as expected. Specific wormhole resonances are being filtered.\u201D\n\n\u201CI
    have a hit at volume coordinates on your tracking readout. Narrowing down for
    signature lock.\u201D\n\n\u201CYour hit is a strong candidate for mission parameters.
    Entering this in the mission log as provisional candidate six.\u201D\n\nZakari\u2019s
    mouth quirked in a wry smile, even as deep in ship sense as he was. Taya was as
    keen today as on the first mission they\u2019d flown together.\n\n\u201CI read
    you. I have a green signature, warp drive locked on.\u201D\n\n\u201CTake us to
    visual range, please.\u201D\n\nZakari initiated warp to the signature location,
    bringing the Katydid to 10 km from the mouth of the wormhole the probes had detected.
    From his own readouts he could tell this was a wormhole with a signature of the
    type their mission was tasked with finding and surveying.\n\n\u201CLooks like
    a confirmed candidate to me, Sister Taya,\u201D he sent to the scientist. Through
    the comms pickups in the command center he watched as Taya studied her displays
    before nodding to herself and responding.\n\n\u201CAgreed. Logging as confirmed
    candidate six. Proceed at your discretion, Captain Kovalis.\u201D\n\n\u201CAcknowledged.
    Taking us in.\u201D\n\n\\***\n\n__Unknown Region, Candidate System Six,\nCheetah
    class frigate Katydid,\nYC112.07.08__\n\nThey'd been surveying Candidate System
    Six for the better part of twelve hours and Zakari could tell the entire crew
    was in need of a break. It was becoming apparent to all that Candidate Six was
    not the hoped for \"wormhole nexus\" system that the Sanctuary School had been
    searching for over the past several months.\n\nFor his own part, Zakari had become
    convinced that Candidate Six was a bust about an hour after they\u2019d gone through.
    Like other candidate systems it had the blue A0 class sun. Usually the innermost
    planet or two were shattered. This one had a single shattered planet orbiting
    close in, while the others were various rocky or icy but intact globes. There
    were also many signs of Sleeper activity and Talocan ruins popping up on the probe
    scan results. But that was just it\u2014there was nothing different and something
    told Zakari this was just another in a series of failed candidates.\n\nThe expedition
    team had been hard at work on their screens, and up in the prow command center,
    analyzing the data that the ship\u2019s sensors and scan probes were pouring into
    the computer systems. All to no avail other than to confirm that the system was
    another of the unusual type with wormhole connections permitting very low \u201Cmass
    packet transmission,\u201D a fancy way of saying that the things would only allow
    very small ships through. This aspect of certain hard-to-find systems on the unstable
    wormhole network was a key reason for using a ship like the Katydid.\n\nZakari
    was about to call for a shipwide rest period when Ava Sosek pinged him. The astrometrics
    tech hadn\u2019t had a lot to say so far. He took the call guessing she\u2019d
    reached similar conclusions to him and intended to say as much.\n\n\u201CZakari
    here. What\u2019s up, Ava?\u201D\n\n\u201CI\u2019ve been going over the data streams,
    Captain. It\u2019s much the same kind of thing as before but there\u2019s one
    transmission I think you should take a look at.\u201D\n\n\u201COh? Flag the isolated
    data for me then. I\u2019ll check it now. I was about to call a rest.\u201D Zakari\u2019s
    curiosity was piqued, as transmissions were not exactly unusual in these systems.
    There were plenty of Sleeper structures and drones sending out a lot of data.
    Not to mention some of the older stuff, the Talocan ruins and such, transmitted
    all sorts of crap. Well, probably not crap from Taya\u2019s point of view, he
    supposed.\n\n\u201CAlready flagged it for you. Isolated data stream VK947-YC1120706-KCS6.\u201D\n\n\u201CGot
    it.\u201D Zakari looked over the data in his virtual display and mentally did
    a double take. Marveling at Ava Sosek\u2019s sang-froid at merely suggesting he
    take a look at this transmission, Zakari contacted the tech. \u201CI see why you
    wanted me to look at this. If I\u2019m reading correctly, this is a distress beacon
    from one of the Lakat-Hro caravan\u2019s Nomad class freighters. That about right?\u201D\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s
    the size of it, Captain. It\u2019s an active signal too. Signal power is pretty
    low though. I\u2019d reckon it\u2019s at the level you\u2019d see after the beacon
    had been on for a year or so without reactor power.\u201D\n\n\u201CA year or so.
    You realize what you\u2019re saying?\u201D Zakari thought about the disappearance
    of the Lakat-Hro Great Caravan back in March YC111. A little over a year ago.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m
    just an astrometrics data tech, Captain.\u201D\n\n\u201CRight and I\u2019m just
    a pet coral squid. Have you told Jubal about this?\u201D\n\n\u201CHells no! I
    might be new on this ship but everyone in the exploration fleet knows Jubal\u2019s
    story.\u201D\n\n\u201CGood. We are going to check this out but I\u2019d rather
    not have him going off half-cocked. I need to figure out a mission change with
    Sister Taya, and then have a plan to put in front of him. What about you? Any
    connections?\u201D\n\n\u201CSome friends, very distant family and all that. Nothing
    immediate though. My folks were with the Vo-Lakat when they split off.\u201D\n\n\u201CRight.
    Well, my mob joined up from the Hrada-Oki. Looking for a better life and all that.\u201D\n\n\u201CClanner,
    eh? Hrada-Oki? Smugglers, aren\u2019t they?\u201D\n\n\u201CMostly. I won\u2019t
    deny they\u2019ve done some warm work but at least they\u2019re not the fucking
    Seykal.\u201D\n\n\u201CI hear you. This transmission though, I\u2019m pretty sure
    we can get a quick fix if you task a flight of probes on it. We\u2019ll probably
    need to use combats though.\u201D Ava was referring to combat probes, the name
    for probes capable of efficiently hunting down ships. Such was the nature of New
    Eden\u2014these were most often used for finding hostile targets, hence the name.
    Zakari thought that was about right, even for as big a ship as a Nomad class,
    and was glad of the expanded launcher and spare flight of combat probes he\u2019d
    brought along.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ll launch them now. Give their telemetry priority.
    I\u2019ll have to discuss next steps with Sister Taya.\u201D\n\n\u201CUnderstood.\u201D\n\nZakari
    took a moment to consider the implications of this discovery. When the Lakat-Hro
    Great Caravan had disappeared during the wormhole incident back in YC111, the
    assumption had been that the entire fleet had been taken out when the SL-YBS system\u2019s
    central star blasted off enough stellar material to shatter the first planet.
    Only those few who survived elsewhere and were desperately clinging on to hope
    believed otherwise. Them and the usual grab bag of kooks and conspiracy theorists
    claiming everything from Sansha\u2019s Nation kidnapping the caravan en masse
    to, well, the Lakat-Hro escaping through a wormhole. Could it really be?\n\n\u201CSister
    Taya, I have something I need to discuss with you. Can we meet up in the virtuality?\u201D
    Zakari felt that this conversation needed to be as face-to-face as possible.\n\n\u201CIs
    that necessary, Captain?\u201D Taya Akira sounded irritable, which wasn\u2019t
    surprising given she\u2019d been at it for a twelve-hour stretch.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m
    afraid so. I\u2019ll be able to go over the data Ava has put together more thoroughly.\u201D\n\n\u201CAva?
    Has she found something my team missed?\u201D\n\n\u201CYour team wasn\u2019t looking
    for what she found. I\u2019ll explain it in the virtuality.\u201D Zakari watched
    through sensors as Taya stood up and arched her back with hands at her hips.\n\n\u201CVery
    well. I\u2019ll meet you in there momentarily.\u201D\n\nZakari lost no time in
    transferring to the virtuality, allowing his ship sense to recede as his consciousness
    focused on the artifice of a virtual world, while the Katydid was taken care of
    by a kind of capsuleer\u2019s autonomic system. Sister Taya appeared in the simulation
    a second or two later.\n\n\u201COkay, Captain Kovalis, just what is so important
    and so complicated that we need to meet in here?\u201D Taya waved her hand around
    the room they appeared to be standing in. This was a handsomely equipped data
    analysis laboratory, furnished with all manner of screens and holoboards. A large
    holography table in the center of the lab dominated all of this. The two of them
    were standing on either side of its long axis.\n\n\u201CThis is a simulation of
    the main sequence anomaly experienced by the primary of SL-YBS on YC111.03.10,
    in which event the Lakat-Hro Great Caravan is believed to have been lost.\u201D
    Zakari gestured at the holography table as it sprang into life and played through
    the convulsion of the star and the mass ejection that shattered the inner planet
    of the system.\n\n\u201CYes, I\u2019m quite familiar with all of the events of
    that day. I assume you have some pertinent reason for bringing up that aspect
    in particular?\u201D\n\n\u201CYou could say that. You\u2019re now seeing a holorecording
    of the Nomad class freighter Farvoyer.\u201D Zakari indicated the slowly rotating
    representation. \u201CShe was part of the Lakat-Hro caravan\u2019s supply fleet,
    equipped as standard with a jump drive. As far as the records show, she was with
    the main body of the caravan when SL-YBS blew up.\u201D\n\n\u201CThe star did
    not blow up,\u201D said Sister Taya exasperatedly. \u201CWhat has this all got
    to do with our mission?\u201D\n\n\u201CThe Farvoyer\u2019s distress beacon is
    broadcasting from somewhere in this system. We have it narrowed down to a volume
    of space close to the outermost planet. The beacon that\u2019s transmitting is
    built into the ship.\u201D Zakari could tell that this revelation had given Taya
    pause. The Sanctuary scientist was startled for a moment but quickly hid it.\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s
    certainly interesting but there are many possible explanations for such signals.\u201D\n\n\u201CI\u2019m
    inclined to assume the simplest explanation and that is the presence of the Farvoyer,
    or at least some part of it, in this system. On that assumption, I\u2019m exercising
    my prerogative as captain to investigate the matter. I\u2019d add that I take
    the customary duty to respond to a distress call or signal very seriously, regardless
    of the fact that this signal is from a ship belonging to my tribe.\u201D\n\n\u201CVery
    well. I can see that it\u2019s useless to dispute the matter with you,\u201D sighed
    Taya Akira. She put a hand to her forehead and closed her eyes for a moment. \u201CIn
    fact, my team should probably get some rest. I would imagine you and your key
    crew would be able to handle this.\u201D\n\n\u201CExactly. My people won\u2019t
    rest until we figure out what this really is. We\u2019ll be fine though. You and
    the expedition team should get some rack time in.\u201D\n\n\u201CFine. If this
    should turn out to be something more than a sensor ghost or a wormhole-boosted
    signal echo, well, please wake me.\u201D\n\n\u201CI will,\u201D promised Zakari.\n\n\\***\n\n![Eye
    of the Needle2](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/5tO6UQqYlKgA9Nrsotgp1B/2b6c7e4ef91286222330412ce7abc1fc/eye_of_the_needle2.png)\n\n__Candidate
    System Six, vicinity of fifth planet,\nCheetah class frigate Katydid,\nYC112.07.08__\n\nThe
    Katydid banked as it maintained its close orbit around the slowly tumbling hulk
    of the Farvoyer. Zakari\u2019s simple explanation had turned out to be the right
    one. The freighter was basically intact but sensors indicated it was a cold, dead
    shell. Most of the ship\u2019s internal space was hard vacuum and the reactors
    were very definitely offline. It seemed likely that the distress beacon was running
    off the backup hydrogen batteries, as suspected given the transmission\u2019s
    power profile.\n\nThe expedition team was suited up. So was Jubal Hrada. Zakari
    hadn\u2019t even bothered to argue about that. One of Sister Taya\u2019s team
    had some experience with basic maintenance aboard frigates and was staying behind.
    It wasn\u2019t exactly ideal and it wasn\u2019t exactly necessary but Zakari felt
    it made a point of sorts. In truth, while he\u2019d more or less expected it,
    actually discovering the corpse of the Lakat-Hro jump freighter out here had been
    shocking on a deep psychological level. Everyone felt it but the Vo-Lakat crew
    members felt it all the more keenly.\n\n\u201CTaya here. We\u2019re ready to go;
    put us as close to the lock as you can and hold position.\u201D\n\n\u201CUnderstood,\u201D
    replied Zakari, breaking orbit and taking the Cheetah class frigate in to maintain
    a relative position five hundred meters from the working lock they\u2019d decided
    was best placed for a route to the huge ship\u2019s bridge as short as any of
    the others. Closer inspection of the Nomad class had revealed a lot of damage
    in the way of punctures, smashed locks and ports, and one or two really large
    tears in the fabric of the great ship\u2019s armored outer skin.\n\n\u201CGoing
    across now.\u201D Taya Akira led the expedition team out of the Katydid and they
    began to file across the gap on suit jets.\n\n\u201CI see you. Looking good.\u201D\n\n\u201CAt
    the lock, no power but the emergency manual looks okay. Going in.\u201D\n\nZakari
    watched as the team went inside the large lock and closed the outer door behind
    them. Assuming nothing had power, they\u2019d planned to make their way to the
    bridge via a series of corridors, crawl-ways, and ladder shafts.\n\n\u201CWe are
    in. As we expected, this part of the ship is clearly an engineering substation.
    We\u2019re in a repair bay. We should be able to make good progress through the
    maintenance corridors from here.\u201D\n\n\u201CUnderstood. Nothing happening
    outside. No change in Sleeper signals either. I guess the Farvoyer\u2019s not
    very interesting to them.\u201D\n\n\u201CSleeper drones react to certain activity
    and signal thresholds typically. They wouldn\u2019t bother watching this wreck
    even though I think they\u2019ve probably investigated it given the distress beacon.\u201D\n\n\u201CAnd
    we\u2019re keeping our own signature profile very low, as per mission specs. You
    think we\u2019ll be good then?\u201D\n\n\u201CI expect so. Of course we might
    set something off that attracts their attention if we\u2019re careless. If we\u2019re
    allowed to concentrate on the task at hand, that shouldn\u2019t happen though.\u201D\n\nZakari
    got the message and didn\u2019t reply, satisfying himself with monitoring the
    team\u2019s suit and sensor pack telemetry as they progressed through the hulk\u2019s
    innards. The team proceeded to the bridge without incident. Damaged as the freighter
    was externally, it seemed that it really wasn\u2019t much beyond superficial strike
    damage. The way to the bridge was straightforward enough, even if it required
    some climbing due to a lack of working elevators.\n\n\u201CRight. We\u2019re in
    the bridge. I can see an active panel. Presumably that\u2019s the distress beacon\u2019s
    interface.\u201D\n\n\u201CYes, could be any station\u2014they can all set it off\u2014but
    it\u2019s most likely security. Usually the bridge security officer has primary
    responsibility for it.\u201D\n\n\u201CEverything in here looks very orderly. You\u2019re
    probably right. Let\u2019s see. Yes, it\u2019s as you say. Looks like emergency
    power rationing protocols are keeping just this station powered after all this
    time.\u201D\n\n\u201CLet Jubal try entering the override codes. Assuming there\u2019s
    enough juice left in the batteries, you should be able to do what you need to.\u201D\n\n\u201CHe\u2019s
    taking care of it. Yes, we\u2019re in. The ship is pretty much dead. Nothing to
    contradict your scans here. Nobody home, I\u2019m afraid. Maybe that\u2019s a
    good thing. Manifest says there are no transfer shuttles left onboard. Escape
    pods are all in place though. I\u2019m thinking these people got out fairly clean.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhere
    in the hells could they go? There\u2019s nothing but snowballs and dead rock in
    this system.\u201D\n\n\u201CJubal says they left a detailed message behind. He\u2019s
    saying it contains a lot of sensor and navigational data in standard Lakat-Hro
    compressed encryption.\u201D\n\n\u201CThat so, Jubal?\u201D Zakari broke into
    the team\u2019s common channel having kept to a one-to-one with Taya until now.\n\n\u201CThey\u2019re
    alive, Zakari. Elder\u2019s living breath, they\u2019re alive and we can find
    them.\u201D The engineer sounded totally stunned to Zakari. \n\nThe capsuleer
    was hard pressed to know what to say himself. Mentally shaking himself, he switched
    back to the one-to-one with Taya.\n\n\u201CIs he right? Is there enough to work
    with to actually do that?\u201D\n\n\u201CI\u2019m looking it over in a personal
    virtual space. If we combine this data with the reference database that the Sanctuary
    has been using to locate our candidate systems then we\u2019ll probably have something.
    Actually, running this now I think we\u2019re talking about a seventh candidate
    location that\u2019s not even on the Sanctuary list.\u201D Sister Taya was clearly
    excited.\n\n\u201CIf you\u2019re telling me you\u2019ve worked out a specific
    wormhole signature for a system that it\u2019s even remotely possible is where
    some of the Lakat-Hro escaped to then we\u2019re going there. We\u2019re going
    there right now.\u201D\n\n\u201CCaptain Kovalis, I am in complete agreement. This
    is a thread through wormhole space that we absolutely have to follow.\u201D\n\n\\***\n\n*Sensors
    indicate several outer planets of various types and an inner zone of numerous
    terrestrials. The innermost pair of planets show signs of shattering similar to
    that seen in previous candidate locations. This system stands out as extremely
    capacious and probes are returning multiple wormhole signatures. Could it be lucky
    seven?*\n\n\u2014 Zakari Kovalis, Exploration Vessel Katydid,\nexcerpt from log

  he wasn't wearing one. After all, he was in his capsule suit. For a capsuleer, Zakari
