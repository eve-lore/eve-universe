    lies in the middle of a golden field. The sun, not yet high, gently warms him.
    The field has grown and not been harvested, so from where he's lying it looks
    like the long stalks of wheat are reaching for the skies.\n\nHe lifts one hand
    and reaches, too. Then he lowers it. All the while, he keeps his vision focused
    on the sky, on the distance.\n\nNot once did he cry out in pain. All that was
    done, really, took place while he was asleep, or just somewhere else. And there
    was no speaking to others; it is Not Done to share these things.\n\nSometimes
    he fingers the scar behind his ear, where they went in.\n\n***\n\nIt is a fact
    of nature that the things that grab our attention, the ones to which we react
    the strongest, are the things that shock us. Something comes at you slowly and
    deliberately, and you have time to think. Something jumps at you, and you don't.
    You can't put any of your filters in place; you just react instinctively. If the
    threat disappears as quickly as it appeared, though, all that instant mania was
    for nothing.\n\nIt is also a fact that high level organisms, having developed
    the capacity for abstract thought and imagination, can be made to feel threatened
    in a far greater variety of ways than the simple things that merely crawl around
    in the grass.\n\n***\n\n It is a symptom of madness that thoughts become uncontrollably
    disjointed. This can be encouraged.\n\n***\n\n He can't quite remember how he
    got here. There was ... a long walk, he's sure, but he remembers it as rather
    comfortable and not really the sort of thing you'd associate with extended rambling
    through the grass and the fields. Perhaps he merely dreamt it and is now waiting
    to wake up.\n\n A long wheat stalk, too heavy in the head to rise alone and so
    relying on the support of its brethren, has bent down into the void created by
    his body. He strokes it, then grasps it tightly between thumb and forefinger and
    breaks it, sticking it into his mouth and chewing languidly. There's no hurry.
    There was never any hurry.\n\n Months ago, he stole some things. It was an impulse
    decision, quite unlike him, and didn't seem like much at the time. Just some documents
    he found while working late one night, documents he grabbed and stuffed in his
    jacket. What he was going to do with them, he can't remember. Probably nothing;
    stolen on a vague notion, the idea of gain, rather than for any concrete use.
    His ideas veered from blackmail to selling to simply putting the documents back.\n\nWhen
    they came for him, he was still trying to decide. That's what hurt all the way
    through: He hadn't even done anything yet! He had taken the documents and he was
    sorry, but he wasn't a bad man. He wasn't a traitor.\n\nThey didn't believe him.\n\n***\n\n
    It is a symptom of madness that thoughts become uncontrollably disjointed. This
    can be encouraged.\n\n***\n\nThere were needles and sharp, glinting things, but
    there was very little actual pain. Everyone wore white and had theatre masks that
    showed expressionless ivory faces. He was made to sleep, often. They asked him
    the same questions again and again.\n\nIt was a short while later that the visions
    started. He would be lying there, strapped in, while a doctor - he preferred to
    think of them as \"doctors\" - slowly turned a dial back and forth. The dial had
    no numbers, only a line of varying width that snaked around its circumference.
    The doctor would stand beside the dial, so he could see how it was being turned.\n\nThey
    asked him the same questions again and again. When his answers displeased them,
    the dial would be turned.\n\n***\n\nAt a low level nothing much happens. He will
    sometimes speak to a doctor whose mask is not, in fact, a mask, but his real face.
    The ivory lips move, and the ivory voice speaks directly into his head. That doctor
    only appears when the dial is turned.\n\nAt a medium level he sees little things
    with many legs, crawling towards him.\n\nAt a high level there are no shapes,
    no distinct colors nor forms. He loses the ability to discern any concrete entities.
    His mind becomes a kaleidoscope turning at uncontrollable speeds.\n\n***\n\nThey'd
    ask him questions again and again, until he was sure he'd gone utterly mad.\n\n***\n\nA
    butterfly lands on a nearby stalk. He wonders why it drifted in. There are no
    flowers here.\n\nThe butterfly is quick, but his hand is quicker. He crushes it,
    lets it fall to the ground beside him. He smiles. He envies it, and wipes his
    hand on his face, imagining that its blood is his and that he's dying too.\n\n***\n\n
    A group of people came to see him once. They all had the same masks as the doctors,
    but their builds showed that they were younger than the regular staff. A doctor
    put his hand on the dial, which was turned off, but did nothing with it. The doctor
    then turned to the group and this is what he said:\n\n It is a symptom of madness
    that thoughts become uncontrollably disjointed. This can be encouraged.\n\nThen
    the doctor started turning the dial.\n\n***\n\nAfter some time they set him free.
    Free to wander around, dazed. No one knew what he had done, but at the same time
    everyone knew that it had been dishonorable. He couldn't get a new job, of course.
    Not even the lowliest street sweepers would talk to a dishonored man. His family
    deserted him. His friends never answered. Even complete strangers, passing him
    in the street, gave him looks, as if they could smell his rank.\n\nHis savings
    had been left intact, but he never had to dip into them, because he'd been given
    a monthly pension. That, somehow, made it even worse.\n\nIn some of his more lucid
    moments, he reflected that what was being done to him wasn't because he had committed
    a serious crime, not really. It was because he had committed one that was not
    serious, that had not been the result of a planned, thought-out criminal action,
    that had just tempted an everyday corporate man. And they couldn't have that.
    So he was being made an example of.\n\nThey had put something behind his eyes.
    That was the only way to explain it. It was like the advertisement techniques
    he'd heard of, where an image was flashed so quickly that you didn't consciously
    register it. Quafe was rumored to have used this as part of their early aggressive
    marketing campaigns.\n\nIt was quite simple, really, the way it worked. Sometimes
    when he blinked, an image was put on his optic nerve. Not every time, and sometimes
    not for hours, and even when it had started it was irregular. There was really
    no way for him to know when it would happen.\n\nThe image was of a crime scene.
    Or an accident, though he couldn't imagine what kind of mishap could cause this
    kind of mutilation. He never got to see it clearly, because the image wasn't projected
    if he kept his eyes closed. He suspected that some mechanism inside him detected
    when it was a real blink and sent the image at just the right time.\n\nThere really
    was a lot of blood. And other things.\n\nThe first time it happened, he dropped
    the bag of takeaway food he was holding. He blinked a few times, shook his head,
    then bent to pick up the bag. It happened again just as he'd grabbed hold, and
    he fell to his knees in shock and fright.\n\nIt caught him off guard every time.
    Every single time.\n\nThe scene was usually the same, though the particulars changed.
    Sometimes he was sure there was something in the middle of the carnage, something
    with a large, dark mouth and several rows of teeth. Other times there were light,
    nearly white patches on the fringes, and he wondered whether he might be looking
    at an image of the doctors and some very unfortunate patient.\n\n***\n\nOne day,
    inside a grocery store, he came upon a man he'd once known. A respected man, known
    for some peculiarities but well-liked all the same. The man ignored him, of course.
    He would have passed on, lost in his own thoughts, if he hadn't caught the sporadic
    trembling in the man's hands. He stopped, pretended to busy himself with some
    discounted wares, and shot glimpses at his old friend. He noticed that occasionally,
    when the man blinked, it was as if a slight tremor passed through his body.\n\nHe
    stood there in wonder, trying to decide whether he had really seen this and how
    he could possibly know for certain - since people wouldn't even speak to him -
    until he realized that maybe this once he could use his ostracization to his advantage.
    He walked up to his friend, said, \"Excuse me, won't be a minute,\" and, with
    two fingers, quickly parted the hair just behind his ear.\n\nThere was a scar.\n\nThe
    man froze, and stared straight ahead, as if he'd heard the sounds of a monster
    behind him and was determined not to look back and see.\n\n***\n\nThat night he'd
    cried even more than usual. Not only for the fate of his friend, but for his own
    inadequacy and shame in not having overcome the same handicap.\n\n***\n\nIt is
    a symptom of madness that thoughts become uncontrollably disjointed. This can
    be encouraged.\n\nDementia is another symptom. When the ability for coherent reason
    has failed this grossly, the reality one has created through one's senses and
    mind may become detached from objective view.\n\n***\n\nHe lifts one hand and
    reaches. Then he lowers it. All the while, he keeps his vision focused on the
    sky, on the distance.\n\n***\n\nIt is a symptom of madness that thoughts become
    uncontrollably disjointed. This can be encouraged."
