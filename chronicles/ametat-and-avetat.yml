    1 \tNow it came to pass in the third day of the first month of the tenth year
    of the rule of emperor Amash-Akura that the midday deliberations were abruptly
    brought to a halt when the day darkened in the sky.\n- 2 \tAnd the sun went black
    as night and birds fell from the sky and flowers shriveled in the field and people
    fell sick in the streets and in the houses.\n- 3 \tAnd in this moment of terrible
    distress the skies opened with a loud shriek and angels, bright as the sun was
    black, descended down to earth and their beauty soothed all the people and the
    animals alike.\n- 4 \tAnd when the angels touched the ground with their feet the
    earth shook violently and fire engulfed those daring too near the divinities.
    Their power being mighty and their presence potent the people were wise not to
    look too closely upon them.\n- 5 \tThe emperor came from his high seat with his
    retinue to meet with the angels outside the city walls. And lo and behold! The
    moment the emperor passed below the city gates the sun cleared and shone as brightly
    as ever before, all in the glory of the emperor and the heavenly angels that called
    upon him.\n- 6 \tThe angels spoke the language of God and called themselves sefrim:
    those that guard the high seats of heaven. God ordered them here to protect the
    emperor against all evils that ever beset him.\n- 7 \tThe sefrim offered unto
    the emperor a present from God as one brother to another: Ametat the Scepter and
    Avetat the Crown, showing the great pleasure God had in the earthly work of the
    emperor.\n- 8 \tAnd thus the sefrim came to serve the illustrious Amash-Akura,
    to stay by his side during the day and guard his sleep during the night. A great
    house of white stone and marble was built for the sefrim to reside in and were
    tended by the best servants the empire had to offer.\n- 9 \tFor a hundred years
    while the sefrim watched over the empire no wars or epidemics or famines ruined
    the lands and the people were content and joyous.\n- 10 \tFrom Istha in the north
    and Melekel in the south and Edras in the east and from Iphria in the west people
    came to pray before the holy sefrim and receive a blessing to take home to their
    families.\n- 11 \tThe sefrim stood tall and beautiful, clad in their white and
    amber robes, with masks of gold and silver to protect people from being struck
    dead by their angelic beauty.\n- 12 \tAnd all this time the emperor Amash-Akura
    did not age one day and was as healthy and strong as the day he came of age. The
    Scepter gave him vigor and the Crown gave him acumen and his rule was wise and
    fair.\n- 13 \tThen Molok the Deceiver sundered the lands and the people suffered
    floods and plagues conjured by him. Molok turned the people against the sefrim
    and people who once sang their praise now abhorred them.\n- 14 \tThe emperor saw
    that all was not good and summoned the sefrim and said unto them, The people are
    in great distress, what remedies doest thee have?\n- 15 \tAnd the sefrim answered,
    My Lord, the land has split against thou, thou must make war upon thy enemies
    to reclaim what is justly thine.\n- 16 \tAnd the emperor asked, Will thee aid
    us in this perilous endeavor?\n- 17 \tBut the sefrim answered, No my Lord, we
    are here only to guide and guard, it is forbidden to us to aggress upon any man.\n-
    18 \tThen be gone! The emperor said in anger, for his foes were formidable.\n-
    19 \tAnd the sefrim, not longer in the emperor\u2019s favor returned to from whence
    they came that very day. And the moment they left the sun went black and people
    cried in anguish for this was an evil omen.\n- 20 \tAnd that night God spake unto
    emperor Amash-Akura in his sleep, Thy folly is great, Amash-Akura, thou hast rejected
    those I sent to thee in thine hour of need. Thou must redeem thyself to me by
    thy own merits.\n- 21 \tAnd next day Amash-Akura had aged all his days and his
    hair was white and his skin wrinkled. But his spirit was high and his will resolute.
    God had charged him to take back his empire.\n- 22 \tFor five years Amash-Akura
    battled his enemies, wielding the Scepter and the Crown, and triumphed in the
    end. The day after Molok the Deceiver was brought before him in chains and sacrificed
    on the altar of God; the emperor died in his bedchamber, his task fulfilled.\n-
    23 \tAnd that night the sky turned red and the people were again happy that God
    was content with them and the new emperor.\n\n\n*Chapter I of the Epitoth\nin
    the Book of Scriptures*\n\nThe above text found in the holy book of the Amarrians
    the Book of Scriptures (actually several volumes). It dates more than 6000 years
    back, to the time when the Amarrians were still a fledgling nation on the planet
    Athra (later renamed Amarr Prime, once the Amarrians had conquered it completely).
    The story of the sefrim and Ametat and Avetat has fascinated scholars for ages.
    The first chapter of the Epitoth is the oldest text containing information about
    the sefrim and is also in many ways the most detailed. It describes their arrival
    and departure, as well as their appearance. In later texts the sefrim are only
    mentioned as mythical creatures and servants of the Amarr God and emperor.\n\nBut
    there are in existence fragments of texts from various sources that speak of the
    gifts the sefrim (singular form: sef), the Ametat and the Avetat, or the Scepter
    and the Crown. These fragments not only support the truth of the story (at least
    up to a point), but they also contain information regarding what happened to the
    items. The Scepter and the Crown, described as made of incredibly light-weight
    metal, yet also very strong. No surviving manuscripts give any exact info about
    their function other than they allowed the user to \u2018wield the power of God\u2019
    and \u2018harvest the knowledge of creation\u2019.\n\nThere are more facts that
    support the story. Astronomical data shows that two solar eclipses occurred in
    the space of 101 years in the same time period as the text was (accurately established)
    written in. Both of these eclipses were caused by the large planet Zorast, the
    next planet between Amarr Prime and the sun (none of the Amarr Prime moons are
    large enough to create anything more than hardly noticeable solar eclipses). The
    first of the Zorast solar eclipses created full umbra on Amarr Island, while in
    the latter the island was only in the penumbra of the eclipse. What is more, five
    years after the latter eclipse a huge asteroid hit the gaseous Zorast while the
    planet was well aligned with Amarr Prime, an event that was undoubtedly spotted
    on Amarr Island.\n\nGoing back to Ametat and Avetat, the two items remained in
    the emperor\u2019s family for four centuries, when they inexplicitly disappeared.
    In one of the last texts to mention it, a report made by the Amarr Court Chamberlain,
    it is stated that despite their age not one blemish or rust-spot is to be found
    on them. Despite numerous red herrings and fabrications through the ages, as well
    as many methodical searches, the real Scepter and the Crown have never been recovered."
