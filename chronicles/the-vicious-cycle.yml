    then it was all over. The capsule cracked open. The naked skin, exposed to direct
    sunlight, flared up. The body swelled, convulsing uncontrollably. Just as consciousness
    faded the saliva boiled on the tongue. Death came quickly thereafter. The body
    mingled with the debris of the former frigate. In the background police ships
    chased down the killer.\n\nIt all began so innocently. Two Gallentean frigates
    cruising along in Federation space. Chatting amiably. One a wide-eyed rookie;
    the other one acting the veteran part. Disaster: a war of words, followed by threats
    and insults. Then chat stopped and weapons talked. The rookie never stood a chance.
    But wait! Police ships approach. Too late to save the rookie. So they punish the
    offender. Justice is swift - an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. The veteran\u2019s
    body joins the rookie in its graceful dance around the sun.\n\nYet both live.
    This very moment they wake to life in their brand new bodies. Maybe they will
    get a chance to dance again some other time - maybe then the rookie will have
    learned some new tricks.\n\nThis is not the end. The cycle of life saved the fallen
    two from oblivion. So too their cadavers are returned to the eternal circle one
    more time. Their frozen dance interrupted as soon as the horizon swallows the
    police ships. A non-descript ship sidles up. A couple of salvage drones fleetingly
    deployed. The lifeless bodies snatched up and hurriedly returned to the ship.
    Getting caught body mining by the Gallente police means serious, serious trouble.
    Then the ship warps away, wanting out of Federation space quickly with its very
    hot cargo. Searching for a cloning facility that doesn\u2019t mind a bit of ill-gotten
    A-grade biomass on the side. Life goes on, citizen. Nothing more for you here."
