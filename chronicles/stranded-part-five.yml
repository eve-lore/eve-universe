    found him in a small, sparsely furnished room in a quiet part of the station.
    She had gotten lost on the way down. Twice had to double-back down narrow passageways
    lined with doorways identical to the one she now stood outside. On the shuttle
    over, through the checkpoints and past the graffiti soaked walls, she had thought
    about what she would say and how she would say it. But now, standing here, listening
    to the rusty shunt of the door lock disengage she wasn\u2019t so sure. She should
    leave. Go back home and pretend that none of this ever happened. But then the
    mechanism sighed and the doors pulled apart and there was nowhere to go but inside.\n\nHe
    was well-built with long hair that draped across sweat-slick olive skin pulled
    taut by the muscle underneath. Exactly as her informant had described. Well, almost.
    He hadn\u2019t mentioned the wheelchair. It looked small and awkward beneath his
    large frame. She stared a little too long, but if he noticed her discomfort he
    didn\u2019t say anything.\n\n\u201CMr. Ansacre? Berlin Ansacre?\u201D\n\nHe said
    nothing so she pressed on.\n\n\u201CMy name is Adriel Ghislaine,\u201D she said,
    just as she\u2019d practiced.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m a reporter with The Scope,\u201D
    she continued, feeling only slightly guilty about the lie. \u201CI understand
    you were on board the Thukker caravan that passed through here a few days ago.
    If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to ask you some questions.\u201D\n\n\u201CI
    do mind. But we both know that\u2019s not going to stop you.\u201D His voice was
    like bottled thunder. Even in a wheelchair, he practically crackled with pent-up
    energy.\n\nShe tried to sound desperate, which wasn\u2019t hard because by now
    she really was.\n\n\u201CI know the caravan was attacked. What I don\u2019t know
    is by whom or why. I need to know what you saw.\u201D She moved closer, touched
    him lightly on the arm. \u201CPlease, it\u2019s important.\u201D\n\nLater, she
    would remember the look of cold purpose in his eyes. How he had grabbed her arm,
    and with a single firm tug, pulled her off her feet. His left arm a blur from
    somewhere behind, locking her in his lap and the feel of the blade pressed in
    tight against her neck. Right now though, all she felt was the insect swarm of
    panic buzzing through her head.\n\n\u201CPlease. No.\u201D\n\n\u201CWho sent you?\u201D
    He hissed into her ear. \u201CHow did they find me?\u201D\n\n\u201CNo-one sent
    me. Please, oh, please... I\u2019m sorry.\u201D\n\n\u201CWho sent you!\u201D The
    knife cut into her skin.\n\n\u201CNo-one, I swear! I came alone. Please, no-one
    knows I\u2019m here.\u201D\n\nShe bit her mouth closed on the words but it was
    too late. *No-one knows I\u2019m here.* She felt the knife start to move and she
    knew she was as good as dead. But then he did something she would never have guessed.
    He let her go. She crawled across the room, a table-top vidscreen flicking to
    life then fading as she scrabbled past and onto her feet.\n\n\u201CI believe you.\u201D\n\n\u201COh,
    now you believe me?!\u201D A cocktail of adrenaline and fear and anger rinsed
    through her voice. \u201CYou couldn\u2019t have decided that before sticking a
    knife to my throat!\u201D\n\n\u201CBecause a minute ago you were lying. For a
    reporter, you\u2019re not very good at it.\u201D\n\nAdriel felt her face flush
    red, but whether it was the anger or just embarrassment at being caught in a lie,
    she wasn\u2019t sure. She *was* a reporter, after all, and it was only a matter
    of time until she would be working for The Scope. All she needed was one big story.
    This story.\n\nQuiet seeped into the room, hung there for uncomfortable seconds.\n\n\u201CStill,
    I\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve known just by looking at you.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s
    that supposed to mean?\u201D She said, momentarily forgetting the thin line of
    pain across her neck.\n\n\u201CIt means I\u2019ll tell you what I know. But, first,
    I want to hear what brought you all the way out here.\u201D\n\nShe sighed, but
    it caught in her throat. Folded her arms over her chest, put them at her sides,
    folded them again. Eventually, she settled on the edge of a wide metal shelf,
    gripping it tightly to stop her hands from shaking. A coarse fabric was bundled
    at the far end. His bed, she guessed. But she didn\u2019t care. It was as far
    from him as she could get and still be in the same room.\n\n\u201CTwo months ago
    I was contacted by a man named Malon Shircore. He claimed to be a member of a
    research team working on a top secret program-\u201C she held up a hand \u201C-yes,
    I didn\u2019t believe it either, but then he started sending me proof. Bits and
    pieces mostly. Files and research notes, a lot of which I didn\u2019t understand,
    but it was clear that his team was working on fullerene-based biological applications.
    Specifically, nanite-infused blood plasma. They even got as far as a first-generation
    prototype.\n\n\u201CInteresting, but not exactly news. Why contact you? He dissect
    one too many small animals and suddenly grow a conscience?\u201D\n\nAdriel managed
    a smile. \u201CSomething like that.\u201D\n\n\u201CHis team worked for a small
    subsidiary. They received specifications, raw materials and funding and then simply
    handed over whatever they had when the deadline was up. Sweatshop science at its
    finest.\u201D\n\nHe nodded slowly, listening.\n\n\u201CThe teams were kept small
    and isolated. No-one knew what the others were working on, but somehow Malon found
    out. And he didn\u2019t like what he\u2019d found. So much so that he contacted
    me.\u201D\n\n\u201CA little far-fetched don\u2019t you think? What could possibly
    have been important enough to risk his career, maybe even his life, by selling
    out company secrets?\n\n\u201CThis.\u201D She pulled a datapad from her jacket
    pocket, thumbed the biometric scanner and held it out to him.\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re
    going to have to get a little closer than that,\u201D he said, gesturing at the
    wheelchair.\n\n\u201CUh-uh. This time you come to me.\u201D She spoke slowly,
    trying to keep the tremor out of her voice.\n\nAdriel thought she saw him smile,
    a flicker of amusement gone as quickly as it appeared. He worked the arm panel
    and the wheelchair quietly closed the space between them, then he leaned forward
    and, never breaking eye contact, snatched the datapad from her.\n\nHe stared at
    the image for a long time. She watched as his brow furrowed, the muscles in his
    jaw tightened and relaxed, his eyes narrowed and then widened. As though his face
    couldn\u2019t decide what emotion to express first.\n\n\u201CA corpse?\u201D He
    shook his head. \u201CWhatever it is, it\u2019s not human,\u201D he said at last,
    handing the datapad back to her.\n\n\u201CNot unless someone changed the mould,\u201D
    she agreed.\n\n\u201CWhat the hell was your scientist working on?\u201D\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s
    what I was hoping you could help me with. What did they take from that ship?\u201D\n\nHe
    thought for a moment, then said, \u201CI don\u2019t know.\u201D He sounded almost
    apologetic.\n\n\u201CWait-what do you mean you don\u2019t know? You fought the
    raiders. Apparently, the only person on board that did. Why would you do that
    if you weren\u2019t trying to stop them? You had to have known something the others
    didn\u2019t.\u201D\n\n\u201CSorry to disappoint you. But I don\u2019t.\u201D\n\n\u201CUnbelievable.
    You threaten me, almost *kill* me, and all you have to say is \u2018I don\u2019t
    know\u2019. Thanks for nothing.\u201D She got up to leave.\n\n\u201CThey were
    professionals, that much I can tell you. They knew exactly what they wanted. An
    entire ship of cargo and all they took was a single crate. No bigger than a coffin-\u201D\n\nThey
    stared at one another.\n\n\u201CYou don\u2019t think...\u201D Adriel began, but
    she was already moving towards the door.\n\n\u201CI think your scientist friend
    has a lot of explaining to do.\u201D\n\n\u201CHe would,\u201D she said. \u201CIf
    he wasn\u2019t already dead.\u201D\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nShe
    got lost on her way back to the shuttle. She\u2019d been so busy thinking about
    what Berlin had said that she hadn\u2019t been paying attention to where she was
    going. And then she was so busy looking for a sign or a map or something to get
    her out of here that she didn\u2019t notice the man until she almost walked right
    into him.\n\n\u201COh, sorry,\u201D she said, and smiled meekly. It was a pretty
    smile. It had gotten her out of trouble many times before. *And into it more times
    still,* she thought sourly.\n\nHe smiled back. And then pulled a gun from his
    coat.\n\n\u201CYou\u2019ve been asking entirely the wrong kinds of questions.\u201D\n\nTwo
    short coughs. And then he was gone and she was falling.\n\nIt hurt less than she'd
    imagined. Bullet wounds look painful on the dead, she supposed, precisely because
    the body was already cold. A moment's pain frozen and stretched into eternity.
    What must it be like, she thought, to have your life anew? Would it change anything,
    or would you still be the person you always were? Would you have given up when
    you had the chance? \n\nHer fingers traced a path of blood, obscuring the datapad's
    screen. Dabs and streaks, all different shades of the same crimson. It was all
    here. Everything she had pieced together over the past weeks. She wondered if
    she should have told Berlin about the weapons. It didn\u2019t matter. She hadn't
    figured it all out yet, there hadn't been enough time, and she realized just then
    that she never would. Still, the implications were clear. And the possibilities
    terrifying.\n\nShe clutched the datapad tightly. An anchor when every part of
    her wanted to drift away, dragged into oblivion by currents beyond her control.
    Alone in the darkness she cursed the scientist for finding her, for choosing her
    to confide in. Cursed him for being a coward. No. She was the coward. The one
    who was afraid of giving up, of admitting she was scared. The one who would follow
    a story to the bitter end, in this life or any other. Adriel Ghislaine, fearless
    reporter. The tears were warm on her face and the pain tore at her insides.\n\nAnd
    then she was floating. The station's gravity control must be malfunctioning, she
    thought. The technicians would have it fixed in no time. And with that she closed
    her eyes and drifted into the darkness."
