    Ieris Hvik steered her small frigate into another loop, patiently waiting for
    the miner to disembark from Ethernity II station, a small blip on the edge of
    her radar. This particular miner promised some good yield, judging by his track
    record. He had great standings with the corporations around here \u2013 all the
    better for refining \u2013 and he was a fast and efficient miner.\n\nAt last the
    bronze colored Navitas-class frigate slid out of the station. The miner adjusted
    the course of his set, aligning it towards the asteroid belt between Ethernity
    II and Ethernity III. Few seconds later his warp drive kicked in and in a heartbeat
    he had disappeared in a bluish flash. Hvik counted to 30 before activating her
    own warp drive - no need to get the miner paranoid by getting too close on his
    tail.\n\nOnce in the asteroid belt Hvik quickly assessed the situation. She picked
    up the signal emanating from the tracking bug on the miner a few hundred kilometers
    off and adjusted her course accordingly. Once within scanning range she matched
    her speed to that of the miner. The miner was already scanning asteroids, but
    hadn\u2019t yet deployed his mining drones. This, and the fact that he was still
    heading full speed deeper into the asteroid belt, indicated that he was looking
    for some specific minerals, undoubtedly some rare ones. Hvik chuckled to herself,
    pleased with her selection. Now, all she had to do was wait and let the miner
    do her work for her.\n\nHvik had started out as a miner, but quickly found that
    she didn\u2019t have the patience for it. But before she quit she\u2019d established
    some pretty good contacts in the mining industry and was able to off-load minerals
    at good prices. So it was natural that instead of becoming a mercenary for hire
    or a pirate chasing freighters, she would focus on miners - preying on them in
    isolated areas and loot their minerals. It didn\u2019t take all that much combat
    skill as long as one refrained from attacking groups of miners. And there were
    always a lot of lone miners in the outer regions, dreaming of striking gold with
    no one to share with. Hvik was happy to oblige, the miners didn\u2019t have to
    share with her - she\u2019d take it all.\n\nHvik\u2019s console beeped, dragging
    her from her reverie. The miner was deploying his drones. Hvik stretched in her
    cocoon, setting the ship on stand-by, preparing it to haul in the load of the
    day."
