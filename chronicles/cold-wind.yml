    Wind was before and will be after, the first of the Winds to blow among the Kaalakiota
    Peaks and the one that loves things that grow strong. He saw the Raata men arrive
    and blew his welcome among the kresh trees.\n\nHe asked Wind-from-the-West about
    these men, and Wind-from-the-West told him tales of fires and blood and burning.
    But the Raata men respected the woods, the stones and the water, and Cold Wind
    felt happy to share his tales with them.\n\nHe blew for many autumns among the
    Raata. He blew for many autumns until Deteaas heard him and made a flute with
    the bamboos, and K\u2019vire heard him and made a harp from his bow, and they
    taught the other men to listen.\n\nCold Wind told them what moons bring snows
    and rains, the time of the trees and the hunt, and which herbs are good to eat.
    The Raata listened and learned, and the wisdom from the tales made them grow strong.\n\nOther
    men arrived, this time from the West, and Cold Wind once again felt happy. Yet
    these other men brought the fire Wind-from-the-West spoke of, and the blood and
    the burning. They tore stones to build walls and trees to make pikes. They killed
    all those that were different, and claimed all these lands and waters for themselves.\n\nK\u2019vire
    was fast and strong. Cold Wind taught him the words that make the bow stronger
    and make the arrow fly true. He taught him to move without sound or track, and
    to perceive the paths that are hidden.\n\nDeteaas was calm and deep. Cold Wind
    taught him the words that sing the deeds of heroes fallen in battle and instill
    fire in the heart of men. He taught him when to run and when to walk, when to
    wait and when to strike.\n\nThe pikes of the men from the West could only find
    shadows that vanished before they could land a blow. Arrows coming from nowhere
    took first this one, then another, and another. Their sky was always covered with
    dark clouds; they could see the sun and stars no more. The orders their captains
    yelled were lost in the Wind that day and night kept screaming in their ears.\n\nThe
    men from the West felt fear creep into their heart. Some left, then others followed,
    then all the rest of them.\n\nThe Raata men rejoiced and celebrated their victory,
    and sang praises to their Cold Wind. He smiled and laughed, for Winds need no
    praise from men, and said:\n\n\u201CMany are the men, and many are their stories.
    Those who have the courage among you, travel far away from the Kaalakiota Peaks,
    travel to other men and other Winds. Haakkin k\u2019len! Return when you have
    walked all the Lands, and when you have heard all the Tales.\u201D\n\nK\u2019vire
    was fast and strong; his eyes filled with distant lands, he dashed to the North.\n\nDeteaas
    was calm and deep; his dreams filled with distant tales, he walked to the East.\n\n---\n\nNo
    man was stronger than K\u2019vire; in time he forgot to walk and started to lead,
    and the northern Fuukiuye tribes followed him. None could match Deteaas\u2019
    wisdom; soon he forgot to listen and started to speak, and the eastern Oryioni
    people answered his call. When for the third time the son of the son became father,
    seventeen houses of Fuukiuye went back South, and twenty-three houses of Oryioni
    returned to the West.\n\nThey found each other under the Kaalakiota Peaks. Time
    had diluted their memory; they saw the other faces were strange, the Houses\u2019
    symbols different. Each claimed these woods and waters as true heirs.\n\nAnd both
    refused to leave.\n\nIn the first cold dawn of autumn two armies stood face to
    face, one arrowshot apart. Light snow made silence thick. Men stared men. An eagle
    cried, and two armies shouted in rage and clashed.\n\nThe Winds saw the battle
    and whispered to the men to stop. Wind-of-the-West lifted the fallen snow and
    tried to hide one army from the other, but men were already blind with anger and
    fog would not stop them slicing anything that moved. Mountain Wind brought the
    cool of the high Peaks into the heart of the fight, yet fury was boiling in every
    vein and cold would not placate them.\n\nOne third of the men fell, then another
    third. When only a fifth was still standing, Cold Wind felt his pain burn into
    fury as he had not known before.\n\n\u201CThis,\u201D he roared, \u201Cends now!\u201D\n\nBlizzard
    and ice he spewed until no hand could hold a weapon; until friend and foe lumped
    blind together, seeking protection from his rage. He blew until none could stand,
    until every man still alive was left clinging desperately to the last thread of
    warmth.\n\nWind-of-the-West lifted the fog. \u201CForgive these men,\u201D he
    said, \u201Cthey were blind, but now they will see.\u201D Storm Wind uncovered
    the sky. \u201CSpare their lives,\u201D he said, \u201Cyou have already extinguished
    their anger.\u201D\n\nCold Wind let his fury vanish and released his grip, and
    men could feel their limbs again.\n\n\u201CLook at each other,\u201D he told them.
    \u201CHow do you tell one man from the other? How do you know which man to kill?\u201D\n\nThe
    men struggled to stand up and looked at their armors; the symbols of their Houses
    were torn and broken, not visible anymore.\n\n\u201CNo two men on this field have
    the same face, but can you tell them apart now?\u201D\n\nThe men gazed at each
    other trying to distinguish brothers from enemies, yet the blood covering their
    faces made all of them alike.\n\nCold Wind whispered: \u201CRemember this. Trust
    your eyes, you will kill each other. Trust your veins, you can all go home in
    peace.\u201D\n\nThe seventeen and twenty-three houses became forty. K\u2019vire
    and Deteaas became Raata again.\n\n---\n\nFrom \u201DTwo Bloodlines, one Race:
