    I\n\n \n\nIt's after 9 PM at the terminal when I arrive. Most shuttles are switching
    out 15-minute schedules for 30-minute ones now. People draw together and wait,
    struggling to distract themselves in the seemingly endless space between. Bars,
    vending machines and VR booths fill every corner large enough to house them, offering
    up a quick, easy and overpriced escape from the intentionally gray concrete walls,
    illuminated only in the cold monotone of fluorescent lights. Pale and bloodless
    in this false glow, everyone looks like a vampire, something I would describe
    as convenient.\n\nNow begin the dead hours, when things start to calm down, if
    you could describe anything here in those terms. Jita 4-4 may be one of the busiest
    hubs in the universe, particularly for the capsuleers, but the eternal dominance
    of the circadian rhythm makes itself known even here. Fewer shuttles leaving now?
    That's the station slowing her breath. Really it's us, our collective breath,
    but in everything now is the human imprint \u2013 for better or worse.\n \n\nOne
    rule is that you can't sleep here. For me, tired of travelling through a haphazard
    network from a station out deep on the frontiers, this particular custom is unfortunate.
    You see, despite my much younger exterior, today marks a much older birthday,
    and without getting too technical about it, I haven't slept in over three days.
    I've kind of forgotten how right now, and there's that moment in the lull, that
    seductive daydream that creeps up on me when I least want it.\n\n \n\nNevertheless,
    when in State space, I will do my best to behave. This is because the massive
    roster of station attendants, security officers and \"information advisers\" will
    actually wake you and remind you, as they like to say.\n\n \n\n\u201CMa'am, I
    would like to remind you that there is no sleeping allowed in Terminal 1.\u201D\n\n
    \n\nAs if you'd actually forgotten. As if you intended to lie there asleep and
    vulnerable, while anonymous passers-by sidestepped your defenseless, lifeless
    body. As if you wanted to fall into that trap. As if you were, well...cattle.\n\n
    \n\nThey take a note, you see, and attach it to your Temporary Station ID. That's
    your first and only warning. The second time you drift off they don't say anything,
    they just start the clock. If you wake up before ten minutes is over, that's two.
    Three is either ten minutes, or a third nod-off. You think I'm kidding. You think
    there's no way they'd bother with this shit. Well, everything has its protocol,
    its hard parameters, its bottom line. Well, where are we again? Exactly.\n\n \n\nThree
    times converts those little annotations into a vagrancy charge. Offenders are
    removed roughly, quickly and without a word. Vagrants don't deserve to be read
    their rights, because by definition they effectively have none.\n\n \n\nNow, I
    remember a few decades earlier, everyone would fall into this trap. There were
    the actual vagrant types; dreary-eyed Minmatar with the signature Sooth Sayer
    drool, clearly homeless and reeking of their own shit, and then there was the
    Caldari businessman, upper management type, rules don't apply they think. Usually
    their first time here from some outer-regional post, Lonetrek or something like
    that. Even those guys, dressed in suits worth more than the yearly salary of the
    three men unceremoniously hauling their still-waking, highly confused, designer-label-clad
    asses out of here: even the mighty could be treated like the lowest. Nobody though,
    as far as I can see, has stumbled just yet.\n\n \n\nI've come here to remind myself
    of the Caldari. And that's also why I take the stims.\n\n \n\nThere's the enjoyment
    factor, sure, but it has more to do with my aversion to cold cement streets and
    the types of people who roam them until dawn. There's vampires out there, too.
    Blame the circadian rhythm, or something.\n\n \n\nAs for what I'm doing here,
    well, let's just say for now that I don't want to fall asleep. In actuality, this
    has little to do with what might await me out there, and more to do with my lack
    of Temporary Station ID.\n\n \n\nWe're all supposed to have one, you see. Otro
    Gariushi's was 19, the first civilian number available on the rotating register.
    Even he, Otro Gariushi.\n\n \n\n \n\nMy first stop is the food court. The primary
    one, that is. The one the size of four Mind Clash arenas, that dominates the entrance
    to Terminal 1. You can't miss it, in that the place simply isn't designed that
    way. It's a four by nine kilometer sprawl of gastronomical consumerism like you've
    never seen before.\n\n \n\nPeople come here just for this.\n\n \n\nEverything
    you could ever want, from the fast and nasty (there is actually a vendor, or two,
    that run by this name) Minmatar bread-soups, to the most exquisite fine-dining
    on the mezzanine.\n\n \n\nThere's nothing quite as fresh as Jita.\n\n \n\nJumpdrives
    brought about some amazing changes. They helped us reshape our world with dramatic
    speed and efficiency. Here in Jita at ground level, though, I'm reminded of the
    ways we've bent this technology towards more base means.\n\n \n\nI say this because
    I can smell another human imprint, and it's something like the salty tang of freshly
    caught fish. Maybe just a little over an hour old. Back then, full of life, swimming
    upstream towards nothing under one of any number of alien skies. I follow the
    scent and pretend to be able to discern where: which planet, which continent,
    which settlement. Perhaps somewhere in Urlen, I  consider, near one of the polar
    settlements, where the magnetic fields create these wondrously hypnotic purple
    skylines with clean, bright stars shining through the thin atmosphere. Perfect
    low-cost real-estate for entrepreneurial fisheries. Must be even cheaper now,
    I realize, given the proximity of the planet to market hubs, and the latest CONCORD
    madness allowing capsuleers to drop extractors wherever they damn please. Forgetting
    for a moment what I am, in some ways, I\xB4m back to imagining rivers of pure
    glacial water, artificially rich with the most economically favorable species
    of the month.\n\n \n\nThen I imagine that fish, driven only by blind instinct
    as it slides inexorably down towards some dark fate. I imagine an inevitably murky
    and cold end; a net, perhaps, but it's somehow not likely to be that romantic.
    These artificial rivers tend to be quite literally purpose-built to the end, with
    the flow of water eventually heading right towards the abbatoir. The Caldari have
    made it efficient to the point where you have to question their use of the word
    \"fishing.\"    \n\n \n\nWhat's important though, is that from this stream it
    finds its way to a warehouse, maybe 10 minutes or less, as these things tend to
    be built into the actual rivers as well (at least if we're sticking to the Urlen
    fisheries).\n\n \n\nAnother 20 minutes and that fish  is loaded onto the cargo
    bay of a freighter, and then perhaps swims around for a few hours inside giant
    plastic-lined bags filled with life-sustaining fluids, waiting for the launch.
    Then, most likely our fish dies somewhere in orbit, if the acceleration out of
    the atmosphere is a bit rocky. A space elevator is most likely just as inevitable
    here.\n\n \n\nAfter at least another 10 minutes, it's at a station (and this can
    be pretty much anywhere in the known cluster if you have a long enough cyno net
    [and the best traders always do]).\n\n \n\nAfter all that\u2026 all those hours
    spent dying, loading, launching, warping, docking\u2026 after all that, our fish
    is in something with a jumpdrive.\n\n \n\nWithin seconds it's here and in the
    hands of some of the Federation's finest culinary experts, where those succulently
    smoked and saut\xE9ed and skewered atoms permeate the domed terraces, filtering
    out downwards before they're slowly muted by the dull mix of cheaper breads and
    spices. I try to imagine just how many different atoms, from how many different
    planets, must be colliding around here right now. Cosmologically speaking, Jita
    must be a meeting ground for them like no other place ever before it, in all of
    human history. All because of isotopes, cynosural fields and jumpdrives. Think
    about that the next time you're dropping off for a bite.  \n\n \n\nBecause it's
    important to realize how some things come about.\n\n \n\nI've come here to remind
    myself of the Gallente. If you ever doubted the capitalistic might of their corporate
    giants, you should make a visit here too sometime. The entire area is dominated
    by their cuisine, which in a way makes sense, since Gallente food accommodates
    everyone. It has to. If you ever thought politics or laws were the primary concern
    of an infinitely fractured populace, think again. Think about tonight's dinner.
    I know I am.\n\n \n\nOne of the great accomplishments of the Federation's food
    services industry was the way they managed to slowly absorb their competitors.
    They did this through subtle and well-applied use of the nation's media influence,
    which extends across all empires\u2019 borders. A predictable tactic, sure, but
    effective as anything. They don't play the Caldari corporate game either, and
    that actually gives them some advantages when operating in State space and abroad,
    even during the \"wars\" when everything is supposedly turning to shit.\n\n \n\nI
    suppose the most insidious thing about their commercial success isn't the level
    of trickery employed on their own consumer base, but rather, the more fundamentally
    repugnant facelessness of it all. To survive economically in your opponent's commercial
    nexus like this, you have to lose your face. You have to become about something
    entirely impersonal. You have to become about a system, about a way of doing things.\n\n
    \n\nThis is why people will talk about the diversity found in Gallente cuisine.
    That's one of the darker sides to it. To most people this is perceived as something
    slightly simpler. They say that the Gallente have copied every other nation's
    cuisine, made fusions and called it their own, branded it as their own. This captures
    the essence of the issue, but doesn't identify the core.\n\n \n\nThese people
    say that we've arrived at the point where it's no longer even clear who owned
    what anymore (hyperbole: trademarks keep that perfectly clear, if only for the
    lawyers - most consumers don't even understand the most rudimentary networks of
    corporate ownership). The favorite topic amongst economists is the strange way
    (particularly strange to the Caldari) the Gallente economic model worked on pushing
    everything into the public domain and then recycling it, again and again, making
    it just different enough to justify the trademark. This is part of what I mean
    when I say they don't play the Caldari game. But again, people overlook how it
    was accomplished.\n\n \n\nIt's not all they overlook, either.\n\n \n\nYou see,
    for most people at Jita 4-4 and abroad in State space, it's enough that the logo
    on the restaurant they're eating at is a Caldari one, and for the Gallente business
    owners and entrepreneurs, it's enough that a little playing pretend is all it
    takes to keep dishing out foods of every type as they attempt to corner (or, most
    commonly, invent) another niche in this already hypersaturated market. Everybody
    knows the game, but their apathy to such things is well ingrained.  \n\nTake the
    Salted Amarrian Rockjaw.\n\n \n\nNow this thing is a beast of a creature, quite
    familiar with the interiors of Amarrian torture chambers, too. It has a rather
    sweet taste, with a fresh salty aroma to the flesh. You can have that at Dieurelli
    with a side of Achuran Songbird wings in a sweet nut-and-berry sauce. This meal,
    to anyone there who eats it, is unquestionably Amarrian. It is a tasteful, politically
    correct marriage of Empire-State cuisine. Perfect for high-profile business lunches
    you want to keep hiccup-free (depending on your clients, of course). \n\n \n\nA
    little further down, off the high-rollers\u2019 mezzanine and into one of the
    many corridors spinning a nebulous web below, you can get more adventurous with
    the Rockjaw at every corner. At Pmokka Caravan Delights you can have it seared
    over a traditional Brutor Khari oven, then watch as it's slowly de-skewered and
    served alongside tender pieces of traditional Pator Steak, bloody and still rich
    with life beside their impaled counterparts.\n\n \n\nSome meals speak for themselves
    and many, do in fact, have something to say. This one says \"I am unquestionably
    Minmatar.\"\n\n \n\nBut in every one of these restaurants, all you will ever see
    is pretty Civire girls waiting tables, with the silvery circular logo of the State
    out front.  Meanwhile, in the engine room, it is most often Gallente chefs who
    will be driving things forward. Not just at Pmokka, but at Diurelli, and almost
    anywhere else you care to look behind the curtain. The Caldari think they're exploiting
    the labor of the Gallente, and the Gallente think they're influencing Caldari
    culture, one mouthful at a time. The Amarr and Minmatar? Shit, they aren't even
    really here. They're just ghosts; puppet apparitions dancing to the tune of friends
    and foes up north.\n\n \n\nAnd this\u2026 this hasn't ever really changed.\n\n
    \n\nI'm opting for a low-profile bite-and-run here, though (and keeping my mind
    off the steaks...) so I stop off at QuafeSnacks. The food here is, I suppose you
    could say, the very bottom line. It's not like Quafe hides it either. They have
    QuafeSnacks Premium and QuafeSnacks Premium Ultra vendor stands, and Quafe Deluxe,
    Quafe Deluxe Premium, and Quafe Elite restaurants plastered all over the courtyards
    as well. If you're at this particular franchise, you don't really have any illusions
    as to why.\n\n \n\nPersonally, I find a sort of perverse, gimmicky joy in watching
    the families order and endure. Most of the food here comes exceptionally cheap,
    you see, but there are no tables and no seats. The consuming crowds have to disperse
    and eat amongst the milling populace, at tables and ledges near elevators, escalators,
    walkways, and \u2013 best of all \u2013 in waiting rooms packed with people killing
    time on empty stomachs.\n\n \n\nAll designed, you see.\n\n \n\nThe bags that carry
    their food project subtle holograms above: a small news ticker, the current air
    temperature, arrivals and departures, station announcements. All to the side,
    all but consumed by the cool neon green of a Quafe logo. Then there's the perfectly
    manufactured scent of it all, the look of satisfaction and enjoyment.\n\n \n\nIt's
    the best way for me to blend in, you see, become just another billboard.\n\n \n\nYep,
    you can do pretty much anything here. Except sleep.\n\n \n\nIt's a non-starter
    for me anyways. If I fall asleep, then they'll see soon enough. They'll notice
    the sockets at the base of the neck, telltale signs of trouble.\n\n \n\nWhile
    pleasantly dreaming, I'd be giving them an excuse, a reason, a motivation to look
    closely enough, and they'd realize quickly what I am. In these situations where
    we are uncovered, alone and incognito, lurking amongst the masses, they find it
    easier to just shoot us.\n\n \n\nWhen capsuleers are involved, it's the only path
    with a predictable end.\n\n \n\nIf they woke me, and let me know that they know,
    well, who knows what would happen next?\n\nI could be loaded with nanite viruses,
    armed with invisible spy drones, laced with biological contaminants. Who knows?\n\nMaybe...\n\n
    \n\n...I'm here to take a hit contract on some civilian in the crosshairs of a
    person with too much money and some serious grudges. Just walk up to them as they
    amble tiredly towards a shuttle and then boom, spray, bang, zap...who knows, but
    it's lights out either way and I'm laughing all the way to the nearest clone bank.\n\n
    \n\nI could be here to solve all kinds of problems. Or, I suppose, cause them.\n\n
    \n\nWhatever it is, it's assured by default that whenever a capsuleer is trying
    to blend with the baseliners (b-lining, they say \u2013 rather repugnant if you
    consider it) it's not because they're here to mingle.\n\n \n\nBesides, the mechanics
    of it all are for them the same as mine. They have the authority to act with lethal
    force at a moment's notice. Against us, that is.\n\n \n\nHidden, uncovered, that
    is enough. Beyond that they have impunity.\n\n \n\nMe, us, we always had it \u2013
    so they get to catch up. A dangerous game I don't want to play. Some of you would
    just not believe the rumors I've heard. The stories of opportunistic savagery
    unleashed upon our kind when nobody who gives a damn is looking.\n\n \n\nI hope
    a kind yet firm bluff will be all it takes. I know exactly what they fear, even
    better than they do. This counts for a great deal. I understand their countermeasures,
    and when you know their paths back to safety, you command attention. They, sadly,
    only have one go at this. For me this is practice. Something to keep my senses
    sharp after a long while doing nothing much, just mixing it up. Blame the circadian
    rhythm.\n\n \n\nAs for what I'm doing here, now, deep inside a sub-basement level
    following two Brutors who smell of alcohol (made from fermented Amarrian wheat,
    I establish, but keep to myself)... well, I'm following the scent. I'm here to
    remind myself of the Matari (always preferred that term).\n\n \n\nBut more specifically,
    I'm making a purchase.\n\n \n\nMore particularly, drugs, and to be explicit, we're
    talking some quite rare ones that have, curiously, become far cheaper in recent
    times\u2026 \u2018recent\u2019 meaning, here, in the weeks, months and years following
    the wormhole openings.\n\n \n\nStrange, right? Well, see anybody complaining,
    making a public scene out of the fact? Exactly.\n\n \n\nC3-FTM (C3-fullero-tris-methanodicarboxylic
    acid, in case you wondered) \u2013 I used to have to go to the mezzanine for this,
    and I remember how awkward it would be to order such tiny quantities in ushered
    tones, surrounded by an opulence that outstripped the value of my purchase by
    an order of magnitude. Obviously, the situation of demand and supply was complicated
    back then.\n\n \n\nNow all I have to do is hook up with the local Minmatar smugglers,
    follow these two Brutor, and soon enough I\u2019ll have a whole fucking crate
    for the price of the meals I used to have to order as a disguise.\n\n \n\nMaybe
    you understand now that I am no cynic to be asking: what's the catch?\n\n \n\nFollowing
    these two along this dimly lit artery towards some unknown destination, I\xB4m
    listening to a crisp, momentary tone as it's played out through invisible loudspeakers
    embedded into the walls, perfectly audible even down here in the bowels of the
    station. The two Brutor look over their shoulders at me for an explanation; they
    understand the game, but they don't get the language. I shrug a \u201Cnothing
    you need to worry about\u201D and keep the pace down the darkened corridor.\n\n
    \n\nIt's interesting that they grasp this much. Perhaps the operation here isn't
    so reckless as I initially thought. My immediate suspicion is that I'm about to
    run into one of my own kind. Or, at least, another capsuleer.\n\n \n\nClose enough.\n\n
    \n\n \n\nThat's one of the games, you see. Or one of the ways they divide us,
    class us, speak to us...look at it how you want. I see a game. In these momentary
    audio blips there is another, secondary message, a heavily compressed meta-stream
    lying obfuscated beneath expertly crafted static and white noise \u2013 all of
    it neatly engineered into a fleeting, innocuous bleep. Inside each one there's
    often quite a horde of information. Here, in this one: a neurovisual map marking
    VIP elevator access points, secure comms lines, security posts, and of course,
    advertisements for restaurants, accommodation and other venues that are all kilometers
    above where we are now, and with price tags to match.\n\n \n\nIt's one part Survival
    Guide to B-Lining and one part Here's What You're Missing Down There.\n\nMaybe
    now you understand, too, why I wasn't about to explain this one to my Brutor guides.\n\n
    \n\n\u201CThat? Oh, it was an advertisement for 4,600,000 ISK shoes, and a map
    showing twenty-five of the quickest routes out of here.\u201D\n\n \n\nThese guys
    just stare ahead and continue briskly along a hard right into a sharply twisting
    staircase that drops rapidly below what I just thought had to be the bottom of
    the station. I'm beginning to wonder how close we are to the surface, to the vacuum
    outside. Everything is quiet save for the low hum of ventilation ducts, occasionally
    rattling a new breath of hot air through these dimly lit catacombs. I imagine
    it all coming apart for a moment, and imagine surviving. There is comfort in the
    thought. After some time we arrive at a door. The two men stand beside it as it
    opens inwardly. I move to step inside and just from the way they both turn towards
    me, I know that this is as far as I come.\n\n \n\nStaring inwards from the outside,
    I'm met by what appears to be a plainly dressed Vherokior seated behind a desk
    with wooden antiquated drawers that sound like they're run on ball bearings. She's
    writing something out on paper. Surrounding her are rows after rows of bookshelves,
    each filled with crates of drugs \u2013 and, from what I can see, the odd weapon
    too.\n\n \n\nI reel instinctively, before I can even restrain the impulse.\n\n
    \n\nShe notices this and smiles, lowering the pencil. She's dressed like a commoner,
    it seems, but the way she carries herself and commands this strange scene screams
    money and influence, and comfort in deception. \n\n \n\n\u201CYes, we're a bit
    old-school here,\u201D she says, looking through the licks of her perfectly straight
    hair, arranged traditional Vherokior style, no jewelry (unless you count rubber
    bands).\n\n \n\n\u201CSo much for not leaving a paper trail.\u201D With the copycat
    pretension of it all, I can\u2019t help screwing with her a little bit. Tension
    is adrenaline and adrenaline is good; it keeps you awake.\n\n \n\n\u201CC3-FTM?\u201D
    she inquires, ignoring the jab. I nod.\n\n \n\n\u201COf course, glad to help.\u201D\n\n
    \n\n\u201CThe cost?\u201D She can tell I'm not really asking, that I don't need
    to ask. She can see the subtext.\n\n \n\nShe nods in turn. \u201CNot much, these
    days.\u201D I hold her gaze. \u201CYou seem curious about why, hmm?\u201D\n\n
    \n\n\u201CI suppose you could say I am,\u201D I tell her.\n\n \n\nShe waves me
    inside. \u201CThen we can probably help each other here. Come.\u201D\n\n \n\nI
    step inside as she opens another door at the rear of the room, and follow her
    into a narrow hallway lit by cold blue beams, all of them reflected in meticulously
    designed angles across the cavernous metal spaces above us, perfectly placed as
    though everything is ricocheting along the straight, rigid lines of Caldari steel
    (perhaps I should say Caldari Steel, since it's their product here). Something
    that looks like a turret is trained on me as I follow her, swiveling from its
    mount in the ceiling as it slowly spreads a web of red light over me.\n\n \n\nNot
    sure what that just was.\n\n \n\n\u201CIs this still about C3?\u201D I'm asking,
    raising my hands out of antiquated instinct. The Vherokior is looking over her
    shoulder at me as she slides out of the dirty robes around her, revealing a head-to-toe
    capsuleer\u2019s pod suit beneath, black with white linings. Must by a YC111 style.\n\n
    \n\n\u201COf course,\u201D she replies. \u201CWe can speak in confidence here,
    you do realize?\u201D\n\n \n\nI don't.\n\n \n\nWe reach the end of the hallway
    and stop at another door. She looks at me strangely. I can see a sense of revelation
    slowly growing in her expression. I'm supposed to be realizing something here
    too, but well, that could be any number of things just yet.  \n\n\u201CYou're
    home, amongst company,\u201D she says quietly, sensing the reasons for my hesita
    as she stares about this strange room before us, but there's something practiced
    about the way she does it, and something definitely wrong about the way her eyes
    follow me wherever she looks. I think she recognizes me.\n\n \n\n\u201CNo,\u201D
    I say. \u201CI think you're mistaken.\u201D\n\n \n\n\u201CI'm not here because
    I'm,\u201D she begins, leaving the rest for me to fill in as the door before us
    slides away. \u201CI'm here because I know a Sabik when I see one,\u201D I hear
    her say, just barely.\n\n \n\nThe room ahead of me is supposed to be a lounge
    of some kind, but I recognize its double use as someone's bedroom (not hers, a
    man). She stops at the edge of a few small steps leading down to a sunken central
    area, furnished only by a large, circular couch, overflowing with blue and purple
    cushions. I think she is motioning for me to sit, perhaps, but she is leading
    me away down one side of the room towards a ledge. Something else I recognize.
    Silver panels stretch across the top, adorned with tiny glowing buttons of various
    colors.\n\n \n\nUnderstated. I like it, but I keep this to myself (she probably
    noticed anyhow). Each color is clustered in groups of four (that's Synth, Standard,
    Improved and Strong variants) and arrayed in pleasantly cascading rows.\n\n \n\nI
    want to keep the bloodstream legal as possible, so if she offers--\n\n \n\n\u201CSynth?\u201D
    she asks, already at least one step ahead of me. She spins around to face me,
    her left hand now resting on one of the panels; pastel sky colors gradating to
    a dark, inky ocean-blue. That would be Blue Pill.\n\n \n\n\u201CTried the NOH
    variant yet?\u201D she asks. I shake my head. \u201COn me,\u201D she motions.
    Her fingers lift away from the blues and float towards a panel of warm, orange
    lights. I'm reminded again of the first room I entered through. That would be
    Mindflood, and all four of her fingers now resting on the smooth bumps in the
    otherwise impeccably smooth surface. I suppose that's her way of saying I won't
    be the only one about to let my guard down. I stare as she presses down, and hear
    the pressurized shots of chemicals escaping from the tiny nodes.\n\n \n\n\u201CSlightly
    stronger, still legal,\u201D she says, inhaling gently as she rubs her wrist and
    turns towards the couch. For a moment I regard the panel that houses the release
    button. Sky blue like the other, but with a tiny little NOH logo on top to differentiate.
    \u201CInteresting,\u201D I say as I indulge.\n\n \n\nShe glides over the edge
    of the couch effortlessly and takes a seat at what appears to be the head of it.
    I hadn't noticed this in the design until now. I feel slightly dizzy as I climb
    over and seat myself at an acceptably middle-ground distance, not too close, not
    too far. There's a stupid amount of cushions here. I feel like I'm in a playpen.
    I kick a few away from my feet.\n\n \n\n\u201CMake yourself comfortable,\u201D
    she says.\n\n \n\n\u201CStrange setup you have here,\u201D I'm saying before really
    considering it. \u201CKind of hard to.\u201D\n\n \n\nIn truth, I am starting to
    sink a little into this thing and relax, but that's more down to NOH's latest
    pharmaceutical sleight-of-hand than this overcrowded cushiontopia. Cushionocracy.
    Yes, definitely thanks to NOH.\n\n \n\n\u201CI'm curious about C3,\u201D the Vherokior
    says, almost absent-mindedly.\n\n \n\nI'm curious about that Sabik remark, but
    I suppose we can get to that.\n\n \n\nI turn to her. She doesn't seem interested
    in staring games anymore. \u201CWhat, in particular?\u201D I ask.\n\n \n\n\u201CI
    just handle goods,\u201D she says. \u201CI don't need to understand much beyond
    the basics. C3 is interesting though.\u201D\n\n \n\nIs it? I don't even bother
    saying it. I can feel my expressions betraying me enough to make the point.\n\n
    \n\nShe looks at me like it's some big secret. Some vast conspiracy. I'm not quite
    sure what to say.\n\n \n\nI ask her how long she's been a capsuleer. 3 years.
    That's a good amount of time. Longer than I guessed.\n\n \n\nI explain to her
    that C3 isn't really a drug. You don't get high off the shit. It's a performance
    enhancer of sorts. You have to be able to know how to use it, though, and what
    it offers isn't all that remarkable, in fact \u2013 only useful in certain situations.\n\n
    \n\nShe asks what situations, naturally.\n\n \n\nImagine, I tell her, that you
    are outside of your capsule, and what you need to do there isn't all that complex.
    Maybe you need to meet someone, or want to get something to eat at a real restaurant,
    maybe sleep in a real bed.\n\n \n\nOf course, this isn't hard to imagine, really.
    We're both unplugged right now. She nods, a slight sense of impatience about her.
    I give a \u201Cbear with me\u201D sort of expression and shift up in my seat,
    kicking another cushion away. I can tell she's getting progressively more high
    too, just by the way she watches it sail away over the edge.\n\n \n\nFor a situation
    like this, or at least some of them, I tell her, you don't really need your childhood
    memories, or your knowledge of how to pilot Jump Freighters. And the more situational
    your needs are, the more you can narrow it down, the less you need to bring along.\n\n
    \n\nShe's asking if I'm talking about selective memory, compartmentalizing different
    parts of ourselves into different areas (her word, not mine). I'm nodding.\n\n
    \n\nC3 helps with this, I explain.     \n\n \n\nShe seems genuinely interested
    in the idea. Whether because of its potential or historical application, I can't
    tell.\n\n \n\nThis outcome is altogether quite surprising, although not at all
    unanticipated. Firstly, I'm still not convinced that these capsuleers (there are
    more here, and 5 exits, 2 unguarded) aren't just posers, and this overextension,
    this trying-too-hard veneer isn't just the surface-deep summation of who and what
    they really are.\n\n \n\nI don't pick them for it. But she said Sabik, which is
    an interesting differentiation to be making, even if I do have the unfortunate
    tendency of reading far too much into these often thoughtless remarks. I'm following
    the beams of blue light on their path around the room, wondering if she's even
    meaning to screw with me.\n\n \n\nBecause part of this must be ego \u2013 my ego,
    that is, feeding into it, making this more significant than it is. Of course.
    Part of it. Part of.\n\n \n\nThen, of course, there was that half-decade stint
    a few decades ago with the Blood Raiders, and then Sahtogas, and Mabnen, and all
    that. An irrelevant association in the grander scheme of things, but with our
    actions come various labels and categories, families and friendships, little tones
    on the loudspeakers that you either hear or don't. I didn't drink blood, if that's
    what you're thinking. I'm not a freaking Literal and Omir won't ever have the
    pleasure of seeing my ass, let alone kissing it.\n\n \n\n\u201CSabik, you said
    earlier,\u201D I note with a stressed hesitation. \u201CMeaning?\u201D\n\n \n\nPart
    of the reason it escapes my lips so perfectly neutral is because I don't even
    have a clue anymore myself.\n\n \n\nShe's folding her arms again and pushing off
    the seat slightly, taking an artificially long time to consider the answer. She
    can tell I'm after something important in the reply. She leans over and reaches
    out. A man I hadn't noticed until now (another egger) is handing her a small metal
    crate, the vials within which I recognize, even though they\u2019re slightly updated
    and\u2026 well, enlarged.\n\n \n\nThe tubes used to be millimeters thick at their
    very largest, usually much, much smaller, microns typically (in the early days,
    first contact). She is holding what appears to be over 7 liters. She eyes me all
    the way over, smiling in a predatory way as she offers the canisters, her emaciated
    arm trembling slightly with the weight.\n\n \n\nThis is a whole lot of shit, no
    matter what way you look at it.\n\n \n\n\u201CMeaning, happy birthday.\u201D\n\n
    \n\nPerhaps I've been moving too fast. Perhaps I've not explained enough for you
    yet. You don't really understand where we are, what made it possible, or even
    what a capsuleer is. You certainly won't appreciate what happens next until you
    grasp a few basics, and you're far from that.\n\n \n\nWell, that would be my intention,
    yes. But this is how I started out, you see. I'm not about to give you any advantages.
    Take it from someone who actually became a capsuleer, from someone who knows more
    than enough, that we all begin here \u2013 drowning in the deep end, trying to
    make sense of these things. Jita 4-4 is a good place to start. It's designed to
    disorient you. If you can start to make sense of it, though, you will start to
    understand a great deal.\n\n \n\nBut try to understand, also, that I won't make
    this easy on you, for the simple reason that it wasn't easy on me.\n\n \n\nPart
    II\n\n \n\nI'll take us back a little now, before Jita 4-4 even really existed,
    to the dawn of the capsuleer era. Some associates of mine at the time discovered
    that I wasn't just good with their cloning technology, I was capsule compatible
    too. New arrangements were made. I was second cohort. Joining in the first rush
    would have drawn a little too much attention, you see, so I waited a year and
    joined in YC 106.\n\n \n\nThe first few hours of being a true, proper egger you
    don't really remember. Not years later, not when everything you've accomplished
    leaves those early days as embarrassing reminders of your own primitive imprint
    on this most advanced piece of technology. Even for me, this was true.\n\n \n\nOf
    course, not everyone feels that way about it. Some can recite their graduation
    days with this clarity that borders between eerie and pathetic, most often as
    part of some well-rehearsed yet banal anecdote about their \u201Cearly days.\u201D
    These are the sorts of people you see in the Navy.\n\n \n\nMy point is, you don't
    really remember because you don't really appreciate what the hell it is that you're
    doing in that egg, or what you're capable of. Not yet. You might remember getting
    pats on the head from some instructor agents, and the rush of your first few warps
    and fights, but that shit is all peripheral to this larger picture. That needs
    time to grow in your mind, and if you've got the right type of head for it, you'll
    start to realize important things sooner or later.\n\n \n\nThe first thing to
    understand is that capsuleers can have the wealth of nations, the influence of
    nations, and most importantly of all, the sovereignty of nations.\n\n \n\nMany
    of us get to this first point. There are countless numbers of us now, colonizing
    the outer worlds, building corporations and alliances that exist and operate outside
    the purview of the empires. Of course, the four nations are not exactly underrepresented
    up here. They have their own massive fleets, and there are many of our own kind
    who have taken their loyalties with them to the stars, whose patriotism has not
    been diminished by the drastic changes that fate has afforded us. Some are just
    scared of that endless dark out there, where not even CONCORD can protect capsuleers
    from their own kind. They have little to be afraid of and yet, so often, people
    - my people - claim that there is absolutely nothing to fear.\n\n \n\nThis is
    nonsense.\n\n \n\nWhich brings us to the second thing that eventually dawns, and
    on an diminishing scale now, down to the thousands. The second realization is
    that capsuleers can die. They are not immortal.\n\n \n\nMany of my kind refuse
    to acknowledge this, but it is quite obvious. Standard capsuleer re-cloning relies
    on the use of mind-state transfer technology, which transfers consciousness from
    \ one highly controlled environment to another; Body A inside a capsule (an \u201Cegg\u201D)
    and Body B (for Plan B) in a cloning facility.\n\n \n\nThe important phrase here
    is highly controlled environment. You can't say it is anything else. A scanner
    pores over your brain, capturing every last thought, every memory, every personality
    defect, and it does this why? Because your capsule was breached.\n\nBecause someone
    just proved how fragile that egg really is.\n\n \n\nAnd that cloning facility
    you wake up in?\n\n \n\nThat cloning facility is surrounded by some of the most
    high-clearance people in the field - these invisible caretakers who oversee the
    rebirth of the universe's elite. They have a job with an importance like no other
    in our world, and with it, surveillance and monitoring you won't see anywhere
    else either. They are the real bodyguards. If a corporate CEO is waking up in
    one of these facilities, his contingent on the ground have already failed, and
    this, the most sacred of contingency plans, now depends on the people in the white
    suits. Obviously, not everyone is comfortable with that, least of all us capsuleers
    who won't often admit how tenuous our grip on everything really is.\n\n \n\nWhy?
    Because these people in white suits could make things go horribly wrong for you
    and me.\n\n \n\nI think the reason we've started installing cloning vats on our
    largest, most powerful ships has less to do with logistics and more to do with
    trust issues.\n\n \n\nRegardless, there are contingencies for such obvious threats,
    if you have the resources to implement them. The point to take away from the idea
    is that if your plan for immortality relies on you never having to ask questions
    like what happens when these become not-so-highly controlled environments, then
    chances are your plan isn't really worth shit. Most of us still trust in the system,
    eating the crap served to us without ever really wondering who cooked it up, if
    you catch my meaning.\n\n \n\nAs for the third thing, we need to return to that
    moment of capsule breach, when your brain is scanned and transmitted via your
    capsule back to that facility.\n\n \n\nThe third thing to realize is that in this
    moment, the capsuleer has become data. Maybe only for a second, half a second,
    even less in reality, but for that moment we are nothing but 0 and 1 as we fly
    across light years of space in between heartbeats. It's so short that almost nobody
    recognizes the importance of this moment, and it's something only a few of us
    even want to appreciate.\n\n \n\nThe idea of the informorph.\n\n \n\nThe question:
    What if we just stayed out there and never returned to another clone?\n\nWhat
    if we could live out there, and build a bright and better world in that space
    between?"
