    the shuttle hovered towards the colony, Kanen looked out the viewport and marveled
    at the familiar terrain. He'd rarely seen it from this height, his face far too
    close to the dirt, and the last time he'd left the place he hadn't been in a state
    to enjoy much of anything at all.\n\nThe towers poked out of the ground like nails
    dropped into sand. The colony stayed in intense communication not only with nearby
    colonies and travelling starships, but with authorities much farther away. Its
    operations were regulated according to policies that Kanen had never really understood.
    Sometimes the crew was worked harder than usual, and sometimes ... well, sometimes
    nothing. They always worked hard. It was a question of calluses versus actual
    cuts.\n\nBeneath the towers, the familiar rock and mud and mess. And, in the distance,
    the roiling magma that made it viable for human beings even to eke out a living
    on this rock. This was an active place, full of active people harnessing some
    very dangerous equipment, all sitting on top of what was effectively a big, crackling,
    active celestial volcano.\n\nAnd beyond them, Kanen saw sky-wide nebulas streaking
    through all viewable space, dotted by planets in their thousands. Each one of
    those planets, Kanen reflected, by the sheer dint of their glow, would be large
    enough to eclipse his colony.\n\nHe looked down again. The burning glow from the
    magma reflected off the shuttle, casting it in red and orange hues.\n\n\"Goddamn,\"
    Kanen muttered to himself. As the shuttle started to descend he felt the light
    pull on his stomach and hands, as if someone wanted him away from the seat and
    out of the vessel; out for inspection by the stars that watched his every move
    from above. Away from the colony.\n\n***\n\nThe hardest part in anyone's life
    isn't the crises they encounter, and if someone tries to tell you different, it
    says more about their lack of spine than it does about whatever problems they've
    had. Anyone can have a problem, or make mistakes, or suffer a goddamn breakdown.
    The question isn't what happened to you or what scars life inconsiderately raked
    over your hide - it's what you did after. How you got up again.\n\n***\n\nHe walked
    slowly through the corridors of the colony's main operational section. There was
    no rush: he was expected by some people, and not by others, and he would take
    the time he needed to get this thing done right.\n\nIt was odd to be back, particularly
    without a task to work on. When you have been active for long enough in a particular
    place, you no longer see how it truly looks in brick and mortar, and instead experience
    it solely as the accumulation of tasks, needs, pauses and schedules at which you,
    of course, are the center. This giant wall, reaching to a ceiling many man-heights
    above, is no longer a wall; it is a route to someone's office where that meeting
    needs to be held, or a support structure that will need to be relocated as soon
    as the company moves on to the mineable rock beyond it, or simply a quiet place
    where you can take a breather for five minutes in between shifts and bum a cigarette
    from a pal. But when you leave - not merely this place but the web of duties,
    actions and results it has woven you into - and then you come back, you come back
    to it as a dead thing. You stand outside the life it contains, like a ghost.\n\nHe
    walked down corridors that held few people, even fewer he knew and none of whom
    seemed to know him. A door at the end bore the moniker Betel Saraanen and the
    title Supervisor below it.\n\nKanen knocked and entered. A man sitting at a desk
    looked up from a slew of reports, blinked a couple of times before he recognized
    the visitor, and said, \"I want you gone.\"\n\n\"Don't we all,\" Kanen said. He
    closed the door behind him and leaned against it. There was a chair in the room
    but he did not sit down, nor did Betel indicate he was expected to.\n\n\"I want
    you gone,\" Betel repeated, \"but there's rumors of Sansha coming in, so we've
    got the usual panicky flights off-base, and the capsuleers have wrecked nearby
    colonies to the point where we can't pull in new teams.\"\n\n\"And the ore needs
    to be mined.\"\n\n\"The ore doesn't need the likes of you,\" Betel told him, then
    confirmed with a sigh, \"But the ore, yes, does need to be mined.\"\n\nKanen stood
    there in silence, listening to the rhythm of the colony. The regular beats that
    drummed up through the floor proved the mining works were operating at full swing,
    and the occasional tremor through the wall against his back indicated that the
    explosives experts were gleefully earning their pay.\n\n\"So you better get to
    work,\" Betel said at last. \"The details are in your datapad.\"\n\n***\n\nYou
    don't spring back to action. That's what I learned. After breaking away, and taking
    the time off you needed to recuperate, you're not exactly raring to go again.
    Rather, you need to slowly rev yourself up, like an old, worn, grimily oiled piece
    of mining equipment, spluttering and coughing in the poisonous air of the mines,
    sidling and sliding into action one more time. You haven't had a broken part replaced;
    you overheated and were given time to cool down, but nothing in you is back to
    new. Just a little tattered, perhaps a little broken, and uncertain how much it'll
    take before you give way again.\n\n***\n\nThe workers' changing rooms were a ways
    down to the far end of the colony. Kanen knew his allotment, locker and equipment
    had been left untouched, likely less out of respect than a feeling of bad luck.
    Miners cared about luck. They'd run out so often that they viciously hoarded what
    little they managed to scrounge.\n\nThere was a good while left of the current
    shift, and when it ended another one would begin. According to his datapad entry,
    Kanen had been assigned an area to oversee, but not a particular team of people;
    rather, he would be present along with any other midlevel overseers on shift to
    guide operations in that particular part of the mining grid and to jump in as
    needed when brute force was required. He could walk in at any time and start picking
    up the slack. The active team wouldn't be happy, but that was no worry of his.
    The active team working in the depths of an unstable asteroid colony, floating
    around unprotected in deepest space, was not expected to be happy.\n\nSo it was
    with no pressure but that of the churning dread of guilt that he turned and headed
    not to the changing rooms, but to the living quarters on the other side of the
    colony. He got in at least a minute's walk before a familiar voice called out
    his name, and a body marched straight up to him.\n\n\"Corwan,\" he said to the
    approaching form. He walked on at the same pace. The younger man, who was about
    his height but rather less built, sped to keep up.\n\n\"Good to have you back,
    man,\" Corwan said. He seemed about to slap Kanen on the shoulder, then reconsidered.
    \"How you doing?\"\n\nKanen gave him a look. \"What can I do for you, Corwan?\"
    he asked.\n\n\"Well, I'm just wondering. I'd heard you were back and wanted to
    see if we could have a chat about some, uh, staff issues.\"\n\n\"If we could talk
    about staff issues?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Would those be,\" Kanen slowly said,
    \"staff issues that occurred before or after I pile-drived a massive operational
    piece of mining equipment into a pit full of an intensely, if briefly, surprised
    group of people? Are those the ones we should discuss?\"\n\n\"That wasn't your
    fault,\" Corwan quickly said.\n\n\"It was very much my fault, unless you want
    to pick out someone in that pit as having deserved what happened to them.\"\n\n\"No!
    No, no, not at all. But, uh, we do need to think about some changes that have
    been occurring here, or needing to occur, even before the incident. Are you coming
    back full time, by the way?\"\n\n\"Supposedly,\" Kanen said.\n\n\"As an overseer?\"\n\nKanen
    ran a hand over his face as he walked, then shot the man another look. \"Corwen,
    it's not that I don't appreciate having at least one person here happy to see
    me. But the mere fact that I'm back here in my old position, however temporarily,
    means there's one less slot for you to grab if it's overseer status you're angling
    for; and don't \u2013\" He raised a hand at Corwen, who looked very intent on
    saying something. \"Don't pretend that you're not climbing, because we've seen
    you from afar, coming up, knife in mouth. So let's skip all the camaraderie and
    the united front dumbass farce, and engage with the real issue instead. What is
    it you really want?\"\n\nCorwan was silent for a moment as they walked, visibly
    gathering his words. Eventually he said, \"You can't be gone.\"\n\n\"I was gone
    for a while, son.\"\n\n\"But you weren't gone gone. They still held your position.
    Even before the Sansha rumors and the capsuleer attacks, they wanted you back.\"\n\nKanen
    was impressed. Anyone who'd caused the kind of accident he did would have been
    out on his ass. He certainly wouldn't have spared any member of his own team if
    they'd done what he did.\n\nHe quelled that thought. It would only lead to pride,
    and he had not earned that feeling. He hadn't even earned relief, though he hoped
    the end of this walk, if Corwan ever let it end, would help him on that path.\n\nCorwan
    continued, \"I won't get pulled up while you're here. No one will.\"\n\nKanen
    considered this. \"That's the point, isn't it? You want me gone because I'm holding
    you back from promotion, but even while I'm here, at least nobody else will get
    the job, either.\"\n\nCorwan nodded miserably. \"I, uh. I need a bit more time
    to iron out some issues.\"\n\n\"Some issues.\"\n\n\"Some issues with the boss,\"
    Corwan said. \"Just some... well, like I said, stuff I need to iron out.\"\n\n\"Make
    your position clear,\" Kanen said and couldn't help a little grin.\n\n\"Yeah,
    I\u2013\" Corwan caught the sarcasm. \"Anyway, yes, I'd like you here so I don't
    lose out on a promotion to someone else. But I'm also glad you're back.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\"
    Kanen said. He believed it. Corwan was a climber, but he wasn't dishonest, at
    least no more than someone needed to be if they intended to make their way to
    the top by dint of being too oily to hold back. \"We'll talk about this later.
    I need to see someone else now.\"\n\n\"All right. Thank you,\" Corwin said. \"And,
    uh. Welcome back.\"\n\nThe younger man walked off, leaving Kanen to make the last
    of the trek alone. Despite himself, he couldn't but appreciate Corwin's honesty.
    The problem with career climbers was that everything they said tended to be tainted
    by want. There was the direct meaning of their words, which was always clear and
    usually more than a little flattering, and then there was the hidden one, the
    real motivation, which involved their own desires and which you had to discern
    like you were looking through a darkened glass. Having one of them break cover,
    as it were, was something to cherish.\n\nHe passed a few others on the way, and
    noticed the way they spotted him, but tried to ignore whatever they said. Snippets
    of one conversation did pass through his filters.\n\nThat's him. Over there.\n\nThat
    dude?\n\nThat dude.\n\nHe's the one? The guy who\u2013....\n\nThat's the one.\n\nOh.
    Wow.\n\nThere was a pause.\n\nHe's old.\n\nKanen grinned again, and marched towards
    the personal quarters.\n\nA knock on a particular door, a deep breath, and when
    it was opened by a woman her eyes went wide and she slapped him hard in the face.\n\nHe
    didn't raise his hand to his cheek, though it felt on fire. Her nails had broken
    skin. \"Hi, Beth,\" he said.\n\n\"How dare you show up here?\" she said to him
    in a voice so quiet it approached a whisper.\n\n\"Can I come in?\" he asked. When
    she made no move to let him in, he added, \"Beth, I'm back. I am going to be on
    the colony for some time.\"\n\nShe glared at him, her lips pinched together. Then
    she stepped aside without a word. Kanen walked in past her, into the living room,
    and sat down on a couch.\n\nIt was a sizeable living room. The apartment was meant
    for two people.\n\n\"I don't have a lot to say,\" Kanen said to her as she walked
    into the room. She did not sit.\n\nHe added, \"Not as much as I'm sure you'd like
    to say to me. Nothing's going to help much. I just wanted to let you know I'm
    sorry from the bottom of my heart, and that I'm trying to make amends.\"\n\n\"By
    coming here?\" She stared at him. \"You think you're making amends by coming back...
    here?\"\n\n\"I was asked to come back\u2013\"\n\n\"By who?\"\n\n\"Saraanen. He
    needs people right now, and I've recuperated enough.\"\n\n\"That's nice. That's
    nice. I'm glad someone has.\"\n\n\"Beth, I\u2013\"\n\n\"My husband nearly died
    because of you.\"\n\n\"If I could do anything for J\u2013\"\n\n\"Don't say his
    name! Don't you say his name. He was seriously hurt.\" She looked away for the
    first time. \"He's still in there, on his white bed in that horrible room, and
    he nearly died. They won't even let me see him except on weekends.\"\n\n\"Has
    he ... come back at all?\" Kanen asked.\n\n\"A couple of times. We spoke a little,
    but he drifted off. They think it might be all right some day but we don't know
    when, and the brain injuries mean he might not be able to...\" Her voice sputtered,
    then failed her. She breathed deeply. \"Why did you return? What can there possibly
    be left here for you, except more people to hurt?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Beth. Some
    way to show I'm not a tired old man who's lost it for good and who puts his friends
    in terrible danger,\" he said. It was an honest thing to say, or at least it felt
    that way to him, and for the first time in their talk she met his gaze with something
    that didn't resemble hatred.\n\nHe got up. \"I didn't want to make this long.
    Just wanted to let you know, before you heard from anyone else, or saw me around.
    I won't be getting in your way. But if he gets better, I do hope you will let
    me know. I really do.\"\n\nHe turned and walked to the door. \"Take care, Beth,\"
    he said before leaving her quarters.\n\n***\n\nYou know you have to go when you
    start to fail, little by little. The final break that pushes you out - which will
    always be terrible, and far more costly to other people than it was to you - is
    not some single event, some great explosion that is isolated from everything else.
    Not a single grand failure but a cascade of smaller ones that you just can't grasp,
    no more than the pebbles falling through your hands. They add up and they keep
    adding up in a monstrous framework of dangerous failure until finally, by some
    banal coincidence, something finally tips the whole thing over.\n\n \n\nAnd people
    get hurt.\n\n \n\nAll those little mistakes, the ones you wouldn't have made if
    you weren't so tired, and you want to say: It wasn't me. This is not how I live
    my life. This terrible wreckage, this is not the work of a man like me. But you
    only think like that after the fact, and by that time you can no longer attract
    attention to what you did. You are advised, by those few who will still talk to
    you when you surface as a human being again, to \u2018let go of the past.\u2019
    Let go of the past and \u2018live in the now.\u2019 Never mind that my past includes
    several decades of not fucking up, before everything started to slide, and that
    my Now involves an old man about to work on a ratty piece of equipment on the
    hard edge of a rock floating in deadly nullsec. To hell with the Now. I'd live
    in the past if I could; the view is infinitely better.\n\n***\n\nHe walked on.
    He didn't know what was driving him on: atonement or sheer stubbornness. There
    was one person who wanted him here, one who wasn't sure, and one who wanted him
    dead and gone. If he did this, it wouldn't be noble, but it wouldn't be for a
    debased reason, either. It involved pride and selfishness, yes; but mostly, he
    suspected, it involved the need to do something \u2013 anything \u2013 with the
    rest of his time other than watch it pass him by.\n\nAs he passed into the corridors
    that would lead him to the changing rooms, he saw, through the glass alloy walls,
    the world outside this place. There were asteroid mountains in the distance, and
    beyond them, the sun shining bright. He felt the thrum of the earthworks as he
    walked on and on. And every face, even those who resented him here - and there
    were plenty - still showed a grudging respect, if only for the fact that he had
    lasted this long; he lasted this long and he returned.\n\nHe walked on, losing
    track of time. The harness of his old machine was there; he could see it now.
    It was empty. It was waiting for him.\n"
