- body: "Towering above the dunes, two ships creaked in the wind. A Skybreaker, half
    buried, its wings blackened by fire. A Damavik, hull fractured, precariously balanced
    on its stern, its nose teetering skyward. The lone human constructs in the endless
    desert of a barren world, the ships were twin monuments to the battle in which
    they\u2019d fallen \u2014 a battle not yet done.\n\nEDENCOM Lieutenant Jarish
    Kovac kept his combat rifle raised and his enemy in his sights. His survival had
    been a miracle. The Skybreaker behind him had become a mausoleum filled with the
    bodies of those less fortunate. His crewmates, his friends, the crash had claimed
    them all. But not this thing that now stood before him.\n\nIt stood silhouetted
    against the red-purple light of the setting sun.  Dark armor, a hood, and a face
    mask covered its body, the perfect image of the Triglavian menace from every briefing
    Jarish had ever attended. Its hands were empty, but a triple-pointed entropic
    dart hung in the air above its shoulder. A shiver ran down his spine as he remembered
    that particular briefing. The words \u201Cslow and painful\u201D loomed large
    in his memory. His finger moved into position over the rifle\u2019s trigger.\n\n\u201CGive
    it up!\u201D he called out, unsure if the enemy would even understand. \u201CI\u2019m
    broadcasting our location!\u201D He jabbed at a pulsing light on his chest. \u201CAny
    minute now a squadron of EDENCOM\u2019s finest will be all over this rock! If
    you want to live, you best surrender now!\u201D\n\nThe enemy cocked its head to
    one side.\n\n\u201CYou don\u2019t get it, do you? You\u2019re *my* prisoner! And
    when they come\u2026\u201D He pointed to the cloudless sky as if summoning the
    wrath of an ancient god, \u201Cyou will submit.\u201D\n\n*\u201CStillness is hollow
    pravda. Within the flow, only direction is istina.\u201D*<br/>\n*\u201CStillness
    is hollow pravda. Within the flow, only direction is istina.\u201D*<br/>\n*\u201CStillness
    is hollow pravda. Within the flow, only direction is istina.\u201D*<br/>\n\nAs
    it spoke the enemy\u2019s three voices cascaded over one another. One feminine
    and bold, another lively but mechanical, a third masculine and calm.\_Which of
    the three, he wondered, controlled its face beneath that mask?\n\n\u201CIs that
    a threat?\u201D he shouted back, squinting against the stinging grains of sand
    as the wind whipped them up into his face, his finger tightening around the trigger.
    There was no response.\n\nHours passed, the dart pointing toward Jarish, Jarish\u2019s
    finger hovering above the trigger. Behind the enemy the Damavik creaked and cracked,
    its great weight gently swinging in the breeze. Eventually, the sun slipped beneath
    the horizon, making way for a cold and bitter wind. Jarish felt it bite at him
    through his combat suit as the temperature plummeted. As night fell, the empty
    sky of Pochven came into view. Once, before the Triglavians claimed this region,
    uncountable stars would have shone down on this barren world. Now only thin lines
    of red broke the abyssal darkness. A darkness that covered the planet, rendering
    him almost blind. Jarish shivered. The enemy looked on.\_\n\nTaking a deep breath
    he steadied himself, rubbing his arms in an instinctive attempt to retain warmth.
    Lowering his gun, he unclipped his canteen and took a sip.\n\n*\u201CNarodnya

    stability is now-time priority. Exchange would lead to glorification.\u201D*<br/>\n\nJarish
    lifted his rifle back up, \u201CWhy the fuck would I care about your priorities?\u201D\n\nAs
    it spoke the enemy raised its hand. Something flapped in the wind, a hooded jacket
    barely visible in the night. Jarish shivered once more.\n\n\u201COh, you want
    to trade? How civilized. I guess I\u2019ll just come over there and let my guard
    down then huh?\u201D\n\n*\u201CNarodnya stability is now-time priority, not extirpation.\u201D*<br/>\n*\u201COur
    stability is now-time priority, not extirpation.\u201D*<br/>\n*\u201CNarodnya
    stability is now-time priority, not extirpation.\u201D*<br/>\n\nIt was small,
    the break in their unison. Something human flanked by voices so practical. He
    almost didn\u2019t hear it. If he had not, perhaps he would have chosen differently.\n\n\u201CWe
    meet in the middle, no funny business.\u201D He pointed to the spot between them.
    Slowly, the two edged towards one another. Jarish tossed his canteen ahead into
    the black. He heard it thud, and moments later the sound of cloth hitting the
    ground by his feet. Desperately he snatched the jacket, threw it over his shoulders,
    and clasped it tightly. He let out a sigh of relief. Across the dark, he heard
    the sound of pouring liquid.\n\nAnd then the ship fell.\n\nFirst came the thundering
    sound of cracking steel, then the shifting of sand. The Damavik began to fall,
    its great mass descending toward them with a sudden and violent force.\n\nJarish
    acted before he had a chance to think. The hood fell away from his head as he
    rushed forward, tackling the Triglavian and forcing them out of the way. Slamming
    into the dune, the two rolled downward, their fingers clasped around each other's
    arms in a desperate pull for survival.\n\nWith an earth-shaking crash, the ship
    collided with the ground, tossing waves of grit into the air. It began to roll,
    tumbling down the dunes, splashing and scattering sand as it went, hurtling towards
    the two survivors. Quickly they rose to their feet and side by side began to run.
    What lay ahead, how far they needed to move, these were unknowable under the abyssal
    sky. Each step was a leap of faith, a tiny prayer for salvation as the crushing
    weight of the great machine grew ever louder in their ears.\_\n\nFinally, they
    were delivered in a rush of air as the Damavik rolled past, barely missing them.
    The two survivors collapsed to their knees. As they caught their breath a mighty
    crash rang out. The frigate had found its new equilibrium. They were alive.\n\nLosing
    himself in the moment Jarish burst out laughing. At his side, the Triglavian joined
    in. Four voices united in relief. The Triglavian turned to face Jarish.\n\n*\u201CFitness
    has been proven.\u201D*<br/>\n*\u201CFitness has been proven.\u201D*<br/>\n*\u201CFitness
    has been proven.\u201D*<br/>\n\nThey slapped his back as they spoke. He was shocked
    by the familiarity of the gesture. Then the Triglavian stood up, facing the distant
    horizon.\n\n*\u201CDirection has not.\u201D*<br/>\n*\u201CDirection has not.\u201D*<br/>\n*\u201CDirection
    has not.\u201D*<br/>\n\nJarish turned his head, facing the same way as the Triglavian.
    New lights had appeared in the night sky, three red points. EDENCOM ship engines
    burned blue. \n\nHe turned to face the Triglavian. The entropic dart was still
    poised above their shoulder. His combat rifle however had been lost to the desert
    the moment he rushed to save them. The beacon on his chest still pulsed, but it
    was only now that Jarish considered that only the victors of the battle above
    could intercept his broadcast.\n\nThe Triglavian stood before him, a hand outstretched.
    \n\n*\u201CPoshlost require extirpation, but the flow grants glorification. Only
    direction is istina. What is yours?\u201D*<br/>\n*\u201CPoshlost require extirpation,

    What is yours?\u201D*<br/>\n\nJarish smiled and rose to his feet. He lunged forward.
    The dart\u2019s tips ignited. The briefings had not exaggerated, the weapon was
    not kind. As pain crept over his body he fell into the arms of his enemy. Resting
    on the dunes above them one ship remained standing, a memorial to the fallen."
