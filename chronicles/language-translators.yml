    most obvious problem in inter-racial communication is the language difference.
    All the major races in EVE speak their own language and all attempts to make one
    the lingua franca have failed because of stubbornness over accepting any one language
    as the dominant one. Amarish, the language of the largest empire, is obviously
    the most common language, especially as most Minmatars also speak the language.
    But the Gallenteans refuse to acknowledge Amarish as the official language in
    inter-racial communications as they don\u2019t want to give the Amarr Empire the
    political prestige that would follow. On the other hand, the language of the Gallente
    Federation (Gallentean) is by far the most common second language, largely because
    of their very influential entertainment industry. But the Caldari absolutely refuse
    to speak Gallentean and the Amarrians are also not too keen on it for the same
    reason that the Gallenteans won\u2019t speak Amarish.\n\nThis means that most
    high-profile discussions between representatives of the empires, such as in the
    numerous inter-racial organizations, rely heavily on interpreters. But in one
    field the language a person knows has become irrelevant and the field is that
    of a space captain.\n\nThe unique nature of the capsule with its sophisticated
    neural rigging gives ship captains the option to link their minds to all kinds
    of computer systems, which they can use to their advantage. One of these devices
    that is today a standard feature in all capsules is the translator module.\n\nThe
    translator module is a software module that is a part of the communication system
    of the ship. It intercepts all incoming communications and translates them into
    the language preferred by the captain. The first translators were pretty lousy
    by today\u2019s standard, they could only translate written communications and
    frequently messed up the text. But the latest versions are able to translate voice
    as well as text and have become very good at projecting mood-swings, slang, weird
    accents and such, for a near perfect translation. With the steady increase in
    cyber-implants these translators have begun appearing outside the capsule as well
    and many predict that within a few years translators will make the debate over
    which language should prevail in inter-racial communication a futile one."
