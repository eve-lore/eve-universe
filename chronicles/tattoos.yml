    body markings and modifications appear across all cultures in New Eden, it is
    the Minmatar who have taken that most ancient method of body marking, the tattoo,
    to a whole new level. To the Minmatar, the tattoo is not simply a form of art,
    but rather an integral part of their culture and customs.\n\n__The Tattoo in Minmatar
    History__\n\nWhen the Minmatar Empire was in its heyday, before a single Amarr
    ship ever darkened its skies, the Minmatar had truly made the tattoo into a form
    of high art. It was said the best artists could breathe life into the skin of
    an individual with their work. Today\u2019s works, although still beyond what
    other races can achieve, are mere scribbling compared to the greatness of their
    predecessors. The Minmatar tattoo artists of today are forever seeking to regain
    the knowledge and skill that was lost to them when the Amarr, during their occupation
    of the Minmatar, issued an edict banning the practice.\n\n This was a savage blow
    to the Minmatar, for a Minmatar\u2019s tattoos proclaim who he is, where he came
    from, what he does, where he has been and what he has experienced. They represent
    a Minmatar's identity as well as his story. A Minmatar without his markings is
    not considered a Minmatar at all. Such a one would be as alien to the Minmatar
    as a universe without God would be to the Amarr. In this, as well as in myriad
    other ways, the Amarr began to erase the Minmatar\u2019s culture and identity,
    converting them into more pliable slave stock. \n\nDuring the millennium of enslavement,
    the Amarr all but eradicated the tattoo culture. Nevertheless, it managed to survive
    in various different bastardized forms until the Great Rebellion, when the Minmatar
    finally threw off their shackles. What followed was a long hard struggle for the
    Minmatar to regain all that was lost to them during the occupation, and within
    the context of this endeavor the culture of tattoos was given primacy. The Republic
    of today is enjoying a renewed ascendancy of this ancient art form, with the tattoo
    once again representing an integral part of Minmatar culture and being.\n\n__The
    Tattoo Today__\n\nWhile the forms and styles of tattoo vary across tribes, the
    structure and culture behind the art are surprisingly uniform, making it a strong
    source of cultural bonding between the tribes. For the first few years of her
    life a Minmatar infant has bare skin, and it is left symbolically so. When the
    infant reaches a certain age she is given a temporary naming tattoo, which identifies
    the child and tells which clan she comes from. This temporary marking is renewed
    as the young Minmatar grows. It is the only tattoo a Minmatar child is permitted
    to wear until the Voluval. \n\nThe Voluval is the sacred coming-of-age ceremony
    for the Minmatar. It is here that the individual transforms from a child into
    a fully recognized member of their tribe. At the height of the ceremony the presiding
    shaman will finalize the ritual by invoking the Voluval mark, where the soul and
    destiny of a person are said to be revealed through the emergence of a tattoo
    on the recipient, the secrets of which are closely guarded by the Vherokior mystics
    who kept it alive during the long centuries of subjugation.\n\nThe Voluval is
    considered the most sacred mark a Minmatar can carry, and in some rare cases can
    change his life irrevocably. Although the significance attached to the Voluval
    mark has waned considerably in today\u2019s Republic, certain marks can still
    see the recipient cast out from his clan and tribe, and conversely certain marks
    can lend the bearer much acclaim. In nearly all cases, however, the mark falls
    somewhere between these two extremes and the bearer moves on with little effect.\n\nAfter
    the Voluval ceremony the young Minmatar will receive her permanent naming mark
    which will reside forever on her face. This mark will identify the name, clan
    and tribe of that Minmatar, plain for all other Minmatar to see. In such a way,
    two Minmatar meeting for the first time can immediately know these fundamental
    specifics about each other. \n\nAfter the Voluval, the markings the individual
    will carry can vary greatly depending on the course of his life, where he travels,
    his occupation and what great achievements, if any, he has made.  Each will reside
    on a specific area of his body \u2013 a person\u2019s ranks within their occupation
    and their clan are usually displayed on the shoulders, for example. \n\nIn modern
    society many such tattoos are covered during day-to-day affairs. For example,
    Republic Navy personnel will wear uniforms with rank identifiers, but their true
    mark of rank is considered to be their body mark, even though this is not usually
    displayed. The culture of tattoo is truly ingrained into the Minmatar mindset,
    pervading nearly every aspect of their society. \n\nA Minmatar cannot bestow upon
    herself just any tattoo. In some cases she may be able to influence styling and
    shape, but she cannot add a tattoo without having first earned the right.  Inking
    a tattoo upon yourself without permission is considered a grave crime and offenders
    are subject to severe judicial punishment.  Because of this arrangement, a Minmatar
    who is heavily tattooed is more respected by her peers, which will allow her greater
    opportunities to advance.  Her experience is there for all to see. \n\nThrough
    this near-constant long-term process of tattooing, it is sometimes necessary for
    a tattoo to be removed or replaced with another tattoo. Since Minmatar technology
    is very advanced in this area, removal of a tattoo is extremely simple, with a
    pinpoint-precision surface laser wiping clear any unwanted area.  There are times
    in which a Minmatar will symbolically choose to use the old method of skin removal,
    which carries the side effect of leaving large, highly visible scars. This is
    particularly prevalent when changes of allegiance or other actions of heavy emotional
    investment occur. (It is especially common after certain judicial punishments,
    for example.)\n\nThe Gallente find the culture of tattoos somewhat barbaric and
    uncivilized, and early on tried to persuade their Minmatar neighbors to drop this
    old custom and embrace their future as a civilized nation. Their efforts to this
    end were initially met with polite denials and later with derision, but interestingly
    the Gallente youth now find the custom fascinating. Indeed, it is not uncommon
    to see young Gallente teenagers sporting tribal and gang motifs lifted from their
    Minmatar peers, symbols of whose true meaning they have little to no knowledge.
    This can evoke anything between high derision and outright hostility when those
    so inked encounter true Minmatar.\n"
