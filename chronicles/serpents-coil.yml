    world of EVE has had its share of turmoil and grief in its long history. For centuries
    space travel has been the norm and in every nook and cranny extraordinary things
    can be found, each with its own rich background story for the whys and when it
    came into existence. One only has to know where to look to find them. The long
    treks through dark and empty space may seem lonely, but the oasis of life at the
    end of the line more than make up for it. Every city visited in this vast world,
    every country, every planet has its own unique customs and fables from some long
    lost past. And some from a more recent, violent one.\n\nIf you visit the Vilinnon
    system in the Gallente Federation you may hear about the Serpent\u2019s Coil.
    The Coil is not something the locals are proud of and the Federation would rather
    know nothing of it. For in the Serpent\u2019s Coil agents of the notorious Serpentis
    Corporation have made themselves welcome. Once the Coil was known by a much simpler
    name - Lookout Post 7-0Z. Built during the Gallente-Caldari war it acted as a
    military outpost against marauding Caldari ships. When the war ended the purpose
    for manning the base ended, too. A token force was kept there for a few years,
    before the station was abandoned completely. At that time local authorities had
    hopes of turning the system into a mining haven, but those hopes were quickly
    dashed when the Serpentis Corporation occupied the now derelict military base.
    The move was a stunning effrontery to the Federation, but Serpentis had timed
    their move well. A new federal administration was coming into power and it took
    them several months to sort themselves out. By that time Serpentis was firmly
    entrenched and when a few half-hearted attempts to dislodge them failed, the Federation
    adopted a policy of ignoring the problem - the Vilinnon system was too under-developed
    and insignificant in their eyes to warrant a large military operation. The Serpent\u2019s
    Coil was there to stay.\n\nThe location of the Coil is of great interest to astrophysicists.
    The military base is located close to some very peculiar rock formations floating
    in space. Rumors abound about their origin, equally divided between natural explanations
    for the phenomenon and the more intriguing ones - that the huge rock boulders
    are the result of some strange experiment now long forgotten. The truth about
    the strange rock formation may always remain on the rumor level while the Coil
    remains in the hands of the Serpentis Corporation, which uses the old military
    station as a distribution base for its illegal merchandise. Naturally, it is not
    very fond of scientists, sightseers or other space tourists. Some say it is because
    Serpentis discovered the secrets of the Coil and want to keep them for itself.
    Nothing strange about that. Trespassers beware."
