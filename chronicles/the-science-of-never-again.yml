    explosions were so powerful that the boy could feel them resonate in his chest.
    All around him people ran, some screaming, others offering assistance to those
    struck down as they tried to flee. Encircling him was the burning debris of shattered
    buildings as the skies continued to rain down fire and destruction. No matter
    how hard he willed himself to run faster, his legs became more and more sluggish,
    as if running neck-deep in water. Every single step forward seemed to take him
    several steps back. It was as if the universe was taunting him, diabolically laughing
    while conspiring against his will. His desperation reached a fevered pitch as
    he continued to struggle forward. The hell from above had claimed so many already;
    he had to reach his parents before the sky lashed out and took them as well.\n\nThe
    heat was searing, ruthless, yet onwards the boy ran, up the steps and into the
    home where all the memories of a truly happy childhood are, towards the center
    of every child\u2019s universe: His very own beloved parents. The child was so
    terrified, he had to warn them of the danger, to tell them they had to leave,
    that death was everywhere and coming for them, but the words wouldn\u2019t come
    out of his mouth. There they stood, the two of them, reaching out cheerfully as
    they always did when he came home from school, as if completely blind to the terror
    around them, to the fire inside of their home, to the flames now licking at their
    feet.\n\nHe wanted to leap towards them but lacked the strength. His legs were
    suddenly incapable of any movement at all, unwilling to obey his desperation.
    And so this child watched his parents writhe in agony, screaming in pain as they
    burned, as everything else in his world had burned, and he opened his mouth to
    scream in horror.\n\n\u201CMonsieur\u2026\u201D A woman\u2019s voice called to
    him through the fire, from somewhere above him, away from the blackened silhouettes
    engulfed in flames, the very image that had destroyed the innocence of this child
    forever. The instant he looked up, the inferno vanished, and he suddenly found
    himself beholding the planet Caldari Prime as though in orbit around her, that
    beautiful pearl resting in the crimson velvet backdrop of the Luminaire system.
    The boy was with the others who had survived, and they were taking flight from
    the barbarians who had done this to them, each taking one last look before leaving
    their home planet forever.\n\n\u201CTrevor, please wake up...\u201D He was pulled
    violently away from the image, as Caldari Prime shrunk and vanished from view
    when the transport they were aboard warped away. Trevor awoke with a gasp, his
    bloodshot eyes bulging, breathing quickly and clearly disoriented.\n\n\u201CMon
    dieu, how long have you been having these dreams?\u201D asked Orsetta Lexmoreau,
    a research agent with the Gallente mega-corporation CreoDron. \u201CThis is the
    second time this week!\u201D\n\nTrevor had fallen asleep while seated in the research
    lab of the CreoDron factory in Atlulle III. Before arriving, he had gone more
    than 48 hours without rest. He ran his hand through his hair and down the back
    of his neck, sore from having been asleep in an awkward position.\n\nHe blinked
    his eyes a few times and took a deep breath before speaking. \u201CHow long have
    I been out for?\u201D He never looked up at Orsetta, who was standing beside him.
    His eyes began darting back and forth between the dozens of data sheets and the
    screens on the lab desk in front of him.\n\n\u201CI first noticed you were asleep
    a little more than 40 minutes ago,\u201D she answered. \u201C I do not know how
    long before then.\u201D She sat down beside him and placed her hand gently on
    his back. She could feel the muscles underneath his shirt tighten up instantly.
    \u201CTrevor, what happened to you? You shout these terrible things in your sleep,
    and it frightens me! What pain is this that you suffer so much from?\u201D\n\nShe
    thought she saw his eyes glaze over for just a moment, but then the scowl that
    she was most familiar with returned. He turned his head slightly to his right,
    just enough so that his eyes could see her attractive features at the edge of
    his vision. \u201CGet back to work, Orsetta,\u201D he growled. \u201CNow.\u201D\n\nHe
    turned away and focused once again on the data sheets scattered across the desk.
    Orsetta had paused for just a moment to glare at him before getting up and leaving
    his side without saying a word. Trevor followed the sound of her hurried footsteps
    as they made their way to the lab\u2019s exit. When he heard the door slide close,
    he leaned forward and rested his elbows on the desk, rubbing the temples of his
    forehead and closing his eyes again. He knew he didn\u2019t have to be so hard
    on her, but he had accepted long ago that it was better this way. He forbade himself
    from allowing any remorse or attachment towards the people he employed, least
    of all towards those responsible for the pain that Orsetta spoke of.\n\nOn paper,
    Trevor Kekkonen looked like the model CONCORD citizen. He appeared to be just
    one of countless others taking advantage of the economic opportunities that had
    emerged since the end of the Gallente-Caldari War. The two states were eager to
    put the dark memories of those years behind them and forge ahead on the promise
    of peace and mutual prosperity. Trevor had graduated at the top of his class from
    the School of Applied Science in Todaki and demonstrated remarkable natural talent
    for research and science. He overcame the cerebral deficiencies required for effective
    starship command through the use of cyber implants and eventually qualified to
    captain both Caldari and Gallente cruiser-class ships. His outstanding combat
    record against the Gurista and Serpentis pirate organizations earned him high
    marks with both the Caldari and Gallente governments. And most importantly, he
    had developed extensive connections with quality personnel from some of the most
    powerful corporations in both states, including Ishukone, Kaalakiota, CreoDron,
    and Duvolle Laboratories.\n\nWhat isn\u2019t found on any of the dossiers written
    about Trevor Kekkonen is that he had witnessed firsthand the death of his parents
    during the Gallente surface bombardment of Caldari Prime. He was just 11 years
    old at the time. He had replayed those horrible moments over and over again in
    his young, hyper-analytical mind, searching in vain for the unanswerable question
    of \u201Cwhy\u201D. The transformation of grief to rage took him to the brink
    of madness. What prevented him\u2014barely\u2014from breaching that fine line
    was the pursuit of the question \u201Chow\u201D instead. In this venture, the
    answers he was searching for became perfectly clear.\n\nIn Trevor\u2019s scarred
    mind, the notion that a failure of diplomacy had been the cause of the war and
    ultimately the death of his parents was completely unacceptable. The politics
    just shouldn\u2019t have mattered in the slightest. Instead, he concluded that
    the blame lay squarely on the lack of superior technology when it was needed most.
    Gallente warships had pummeled Caldari Prime cities from orbit uncontested for
    far too long; had planetary defense been in the forefront of the Caldari technological
    initiative at the time, things might have been different. Instead, the technology
    was reactive; it created a punch-for-punch battle of technological advances that
    could have been avoided. As evident by the fate of Trevor\u2019s parents and hundreds
    of thousands like them, the Caldari paid a terrible price for their lack of foresight.
    The Gallente had their orbital bombers; the Caldari answered with single-man fighters.
    The Gallente countered the fighters with drones; and if not for the Jovian gift
    of capsule technology, the Caldari might not have been able to muster an effective
    response at all.\n\nAs young Trevor watched the war and its technological innovations
    evolve into a stalemate, the rage within him grew steadily until the ultimate
    betrayal that hurled his soul into the abyss for good. The truce that left Caldari
    Prime\u2014once the home world for millions of Caldari\u2014legally in the hands
    of the Gallente Federation was the breaking point. Trevor felt that he was orphaned
    yet again, only this time a resurrection was possible\u2014if only he could raise
    Caldari technology from the dead.\n\nAnd so Trevor\u2019s life became a dichotomy
    of purpose; part missionary, part vigilante, laboring on behalf of the \u201Cgood\u201D
    of one race by planning the death of another. The path leading him to the vengeance
    he craved had two obstacles. First, a detailed understanding of the strengths
    and weaknesses of both Caldari and Gallente technology--especially with their
    respective starship engineering methodologies--had to be accomplished. Second,
    it required bleeding-edge scientific breakthroughs that could ultimately be used
    to tilt the balance of power forever in favor of the Caldari State. On the first
    count, Trevor had already succeeded. But it wasn\u2019t until the famous Crielere
    Research Lab\u2014yet another sickening example of how the Caldari couldn\u2019t
    push the technology envelope unassisted\u2014had discovered the precious mineral
    morphite and its extraordinary chemical properties that the possibilities he sought
    finally began to emerge.\n\nTrevor opened his eyes and scanned the progress of
    one of those possibilities. The datasheets contained the results of experiments
    and unfinished theoretical conjectures. He had fallen asleep while reading through
    some of them, exhausted after days without sleep. Orsetta was one of several research
    agents from corporations that Trevor had commissioned to assist him in finding
    the answers he needed. She, like the rest of the research agents under his employ,
    carried out the bulk of the experiments and research required to test his theories.
    They were dedicated in their work and brilliant scientists in their own right,
    but required his constant financial and logistical support to keep up with the
    workload he imposed on them. And although he realized that science was, by nature,
    a very methodical process that could never be rushed, his impositions were especially
    harsh on the Gallente agents under his employ.\n\nHe got up slowly to stretch
    out his legs. Walking over to the window opposite of the lab screens and holoprojectors,
    he leaned against the frame, watching the station approach warning beacons blink
    on\u2026and off. There\u2026and gone. Life\u2026and death. Everywhere Trevor looked,
    the nightmare stared right back him. His only shelter from the demons was in the
    relentless pursuit of science. Once outside of it, his soul belonged to the ghosts
    of Caldari Prime.\n\nNever again, he thought. To someday be able to speak those
    words to the defeated remnants of the Gallente nation that he despised so much
    was his life\u2019s ambition, and he believed that science would one day grant
    him his wish. It was all just a matter of time, and he could stand the sleepless
    nights for as long as it took to get there.\n\nThe intercom broke his fixation
    on the blinking lights outside. \u201CMonsieur, have a look at this, quickly!\u201D
    It was Orsetta\u2019s voice on the intercom, and there was a hint of excitement
    in her tone. Accustomed to being instantly agitated just from the sound of her
    voice, Trevor was about to say something rude when he noticed the lights in the
    room dim. When he turned away from the window frame, he saw that the holoprojector
    had been remotely switched on. There before him were a series of three-dimensional
    images floating over the lab desk, moving rapidly in successive sequence from
    mathematical equations to subatomic particle diagrams; from molecular compound
    models to exploded-view engineering drawings of mechanical components; and finally
    to the animation of those same components converging perfectly with each other
    to form schematics of the finished product. Performance and statistical information
    scrolled down along each side of the image. Trevor was shocked.\n\n\u201CThis\u2026this
    is the production compilation?\u201D he asked.\n\nOrsetta was so excited that
    she was nearly incoherent. \u201CThe containment issues were all solved, we\u2019ve
    overcome the stability problems inherent with using morphite-based alloys and
    found a suitable quantum solution to the mesoscopic issues caused by placing nanosensors
    within the alloy shell to monitor\u2026\u201D\n\n\u201CIs..this..the..production..compilation?\u201D
    Trevor interrupted, exaggerating the enunciation of his words. There was pause
    before the intercom speakers delivered her answer.\n\n\u201COui, monsieur.\u201D\n\n\u201CSo
    what took so long? Move on to the next project I outlined already.\u201D Trevor
    walked through the floating image to the lab desk and switched off the holoprojector.
    A disc ejected from the lab table console containing the compiled blueprint information.
    He slipped it inside the jacket he\u2019d brought and started gathering the rest
    of his things. It was time to leave and check on the progress of his other research
    agents.\n\nThe lab door hissed open and Orsetta walked into the room. She stood
    with her arms folded and stared at Trevor with a concerned expression on her face.
    He continued his preparations without looking at her.\n\n\u201CYou have more work
    that you should be attending to,\u201D he muttered.\n\n\u201CI cannot help but
    ask,\u201D she started carefully. \u201CWhat do you plan to do with those blueprints?\u201D\n\nTrevor
    paused for just a moment before answering.\n\n\u201CYou\u2019ll find out soon
    enough.\u201D\n"
