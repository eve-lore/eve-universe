    Admiral closed the holo-conference connection and glanced out the window. Darkness
    had fallen and two of New Caldari\u2019s moons had risen.\n\n\u201CContinue personal
    journal,\u201D the Admiral said. A small flashing icon appeared in the bottom
    corner of the holographic display.\n\n\u201CThe divisional leaders\u2019 meeting
    this evening was productive, not all good news, but productive. STAR is reporting
    an increase in new pilots coming out of the various academies and an increased
    workload. I wish the academies would give a bit more real-life training instead
    of simulations. Piloting a Mammoth in a system with a lower CONCORD presence is
    much different than racing a souped-up Burst between here and Matigu. STAR needs
    more personnel to give these new pilots the assistance they need.\u201D\n\n\u2018The
    Communications Relay Commission is reporting an increase in faster-than-light
    message traffic. Their fluid routers are handling the load fine, but a slight
    increase in funding and resources may need to be considered in the near future.
    Spurious and illegal traffic is declining due to their efforts and some activity
    has been turned over to the SCC for further action. There are going to be some
    very annoyed CEOs and CFOs enjoying some time in the penal colonies.\u201D\n\nThere
    was a knock at the door. The icon on the screen remained steady at the Admiral\u2019s
    \u201CPause recording\u201D prompt. \u201CEnter,\u201D the Admiral called out.
    An aide de camp walked into the room carrying a black striped folder.\n\n\u201CSir,
    AURORA is reporting an increase in Angel Cartel activity in Curse.\u201D The aide
    passed the folder over to the Admiral to look through. Graphs of souls lost, ships
    and cargo destroyed, projected economic impact to trade in the region and other
    information was dispersed through dossiers of Cartel agents, activity reports
    and intelligence.\n\n\u201CForward AURORA\u2019s sanitized findings to DED for
    action. Make sure the intelligence is clean. We don\u2019t want to lose another
    AURORA agent. Don\u2019t make the same mistake your predecessor made.\u201D The
    Admiral handed the folder back.\n\n\u201CNo, Sir! The information will be clean
    with no possible ties to our sources.\u201D The aide tucked the folder under his
    arm, saluted and left the room.\n\n\u201CResume\u201D\n\nThe record icon on the
    holo-screen started flashing again. \u201CThe boys in the Technology Division
    want a closer look at the Transcranial Microcontrollers and see if there are any
    manufacturing ties to the Sansha devices. I have to agree with the Bug Hunters,
    the Inner Circle made too quick a decision on their usage. The Bug Hunters are
    also working on some other issues, the notification after a successful jump installed
    in the last pod flightware upgrade caused some pilots migraines and they got that
    removed quick enough. They bust some major butt working on these things.\u201D\n\nThe
    Admiral paused for a moment and rubbed his eyes. The record icon continued to
    flash next to the clock. \u201CEnd personal journal, bookmark and close all files,
    shut down. Time to head home.\u201D The holo-projectors blinked and went dark."
