    existential threats.\u201D\n\nDarkness.\n\n\u201CWe have learned what we needed
    to learn.\u201D\n\nA fleeting moment of nightmare.\n\n\u201CTransmit all data.\u201D\n\nSparks
    of blue and white against the mind\u2019s eye, then shocking wakefulness.\n\nElder
    Mentor Matshi Raish opened his eyes and coughed to life in the lukewarm, gelatinous
    embrace of his cloning pod. He lay there a moment, eyes closed once more and breathed
    in and out, slowly and consciously. His mind calmed, he reached out with it and
    activated the release sequence of his cloning pod.\n\nAs the pod spinal connections
    disengaged, powerful drainage pumps drew away the mass of the gel that had protected,
    nourished and maintained his clone body. Pressure and gas composition within the
    pod equalized with the resurrection chamber before the pod seals separated and
    the lid hinged out and up. The pod had already raised itself so that it was almost
    upright, angled back slightly so that Matshi easily lay back against the gelpack
    padding covering the inner surface.\n\nMatshi opened his eyes again and noted
    the presence of an attendant in the resurrection chamber. This was normal, the
    cloning pod\u2019s activation signal would have called a member of the kitz to
    the chamber to assist the reborn Society of Conscious Thought fellow being decanted
    into a new clone.\n\nThe figure waiting in the dimness of the chamber came forward
    and helped Raish from the pod, into a loose robe and over to a nearby couch. Raish
    sat a moment, breathed in and out, then looked up at his helper, about to thank
    him, before he saw who was bending solicitously over him and had to catch his
    breath anew. It was none other than Veniel, one of the few remaining Jove members
    of the Society of Conscious Thought, and perhaps the only one who remained active.\n\n\u201CArchon,
    why are you here?\u201D Raish struggled to rise, his words coming in a rush, \u201CHow
    may I assist you? Are you here to advise us?\u201D He had not spoken to his old
    teacher for years, let alone seen him in person, and his sudden appearance here,
    at this moment, was deeply shocking.\n\nVeniel smiled and gently pressed Raish
    back into his seat, holding him there a moment before sitting next to him on the
    couch. \u201CArchon, no more, my friend. Simply, Veniel, as I have always been.\u201D\n\n\u201CArchon,
    no more? I do not understand.\u201D Raish\u2019s recent memories caught up with
    him and he struggled once more to speak, his thoughts tumbling out. \u201CI must
    tell you, the Empress, there is a great threat!\u201D\n\n\u201CYes, I am aware
    of the problem with the Amarr Empress. To some extent this is why I am here but
    there are even larger issues to consider.\u201D\n\n\u201CProblem? My scans of
    her vessel\u2019s systems indicated the presence of a non-standard infomorph signature
    associated with her own neural interface connections. That would be questionable
    in itself but our scans were able to resolve two distinct signatures. Distinct
    but intermingled. This indicates informational intrusion and parasitism at the
    personality level.\u201D\n\nVeniel held up his hand and smiled again, a very deliberate
    gesture for a Jovian but one that seemed to come easily to him. \u201CYes, the
    Empress is compromised. This is becoming increasingly evident. Those with the
    means to make the necessary observations of her behavior are likely to suspect
    something is amiss. You yourself were driven to risk open action on the basis
    of the information available to you.\u201D\n\nRaish grimaced. \u201CYes, our network
    within the Imperial Court has been gathering data on the Empress ever since her
    coronation. Recently, her behavioral patterns showed increasing signs of change,
    in particular there were psycholinguistic anomalies that could not readily be
    accounted for by mundane causation such as disease or psychological syndromes.
    Moreover, the synchronicity of these changes and anomalies with...\u201D\n\n\u201CWith
    the emergence of the Second Empire survivors from Anoikis was striking and clear,\u201D
    finished Veniel.\n\n\u201CYes, Archon. Therefore I took the risk, as did the adepts
    that volunteered to crew my ship. Tell me, do you know if any were captured?\u201D\n\n\u201CThey
    all passed peacefully. I am sure all were well aware of what awaited them if captured
    alive. After all, they have only lost a little time, is that not so?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes,
    Archon, all synchronized before we left on the mission.\u201D\n\n\u201CThere we
    are then and, Matshi? Please, I am just Veniel now. Many titles I have had. Archon.
    Polemarkos. Prophet. Renegade. Demon.\u201D Veniel smiled again, \u201CNow I have
    none. This is the way of things. What we are is not a constant. We are what we
    do and what we do changes according to the times. For you too, this has happened
    and will happen again.\u201D\n\nRaish nodded in understanding and thought a moment
    before continuing. \u201CIt is sure that the Empress has been compromised by a
    sapient infomorph, likely artificial in nature. This calls for action to be taken.\u201D\n\nVeniel
    regarded his former student silently for a moment, then asked, \u201CWhat action
    would you take?\u201D\n\n\u201CWe should analyze the data further but the artificial
    sapient is almost certainly a high level entity capable of multiple simultaneous
    intrusions. However, even a first glance at the scanning data indicated a very
    high level of intermingling, more perhaps than would be necessary. For some reason
    it is there and the personalities must be bleeding into one another.\u201D\n\nVeniel
    absorbed this information and mused on it. \u201CShe struggles but subtly,\u201D
    he said shortly.\n\n\u201CYou mean that the entity has found it necessary to intermingle
    to this degree to control her?\u201D\n\n\u201CNo, not at all. The need for it
    to do so would indicate a relatively unsophisticated brute level of entity and
    this one is not that. Rather, she opposes it in the only way that she can. She
    draws it in. It is an impressive act of will. I recall that the Society tutors
    who attended on her noted her mental capabilities as very high indeed.\u201D\n\n\u201CThen
    the true Jamyl Sarum thinks along the same lines. This intermingling is a weakness,
    it indicates a high investment and commitment to the connection with her personality.
    It provides an opportunity that we should exploit.\u201D\n\n\u201CSpeaking plainly,
    you are advocating the assassination of the Empress of Amarr.\u201D Veniel regarded
    Raish quizzically.\n\n\u201CThis entity is a severe existential threat. Its sentience
    quotient must be at least 15 positive.\u201D\n\n\u201CSeveral points more I should
    think,\u201D interrupted Veniel.\n\n\u201CMore? Then all the greater reason to
    intervene. Its entire motivation cannot help but be inimical to the interests
    of living sapients in the New Eden cluster.\u201D\n\n\u201CWe should perhaps leave
    aside, for now, the question of the necessity of countervailing interests among
    those with widely separated sentience quotients.\u201D Veniel cocked his head
    and looked Raish in the eye. \u201CBut, even granting it, you place no great faith
    in the true Jamyl\u2019s ability to effectively bring her plan to completion?\u201D\n\n\u201CWhy...
    how could she actively pursue it? Surely any conscious plan would be apparent
    to the entity and readily countered.\u201D\n\n\u201CPerhaps but my own information
    is that Jamyl is not without allies in her struggle. I would speculate that this
    particular entity likely has a weakness in comprehending certain modes of thought
    fully and therefore the behavior and uses of language arising from such thought.\n\n\u201CTo
    be explicit, it is probable that the entity views the religious mode of thought
    through the prism of power and politics alone. We might imagine that it sees this
    viewpoint mirrored in the Amarr Empire and the Imperial Court. Yet we can appreciate
    in a way that it may not that even an Amarr Empress can have a different sensibility.
    Thus arises an opportunity for subterfuge and, perhaps, collaboration.\u201D\n\nRaish
    sat silent for a long moment, appearing to reflect on the Jove\u2019s remarks.
    He nodded slowly, \u201CThere were some aspects of the psycholinguistic analysis
    that might imply something of the sort but we did not consider the possibility
    you have raised.\u201D\n\n\u201CAlas, we often see only what we are looking for.\u201D
    Veniel raised a hand slightly as Raish\u2019s face fell. \u201CNo, do not reproach
    yourself too harshly on that account, the myopia of the seeker who has in mind
    the shape of the truth before finding it is an all too common failing. My people\u2019s
    history can offer much evidence of that, I assure you.\u201D\n\nRaish gathered
    his robe about himself and stood slowly, nodding as Veniel gently helped him up
    and then stood back, allowing Raish to slowly pace some life into his limbs. The
    Society Mentor walked back and forth a little before turning to look directly
    at the Jove again. \u201CYou counsel patience then? To allow events to play out
    further?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes, certainly, while the threat is real, matters have
    not reached a true crisis point and are unlikely to do so for some time. The Second
    Empire survivors are clearly in a state of some confusion and exhibit an incoherence
    to their pattern that is suggestive of significant internal discord. This would
    not be particularly surprising when discussing the collective actions of formerly
    isolated Jove enclaves attempting to organize to common purpose in an unfamiliar
    environment.\n\n\u201CWith the survivors the situation is even worse. Their enclaves
    were virtual constructs that have been running for centuries. Inevitably, there
    was degradation in many instances, and much that took place in Anoikis over the
    centuries of the Stasis faction\u2019s presence there is a mystery. The uncontrolled
    wormhole access to Anoikis made possible by the Isogen-5 Quantum Criticality Event
    led to an explosive spike in destruction of the survivor enclaves\u2019 virtuality
    infrastructure. We can only guess at the effects. Additionally, there are other
    factors to consider.\u201D\n\n\u201COther factors, Veniel?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes,
    but we must discuss those while in transit. We have spent much time in talk here
    and there is a long way to travel.\u201D\n\n\u201CTravel? Where are we going?\u201D\n\nVeniel\u2019s
    mouth quirked into his very deliberate smile once more. \u201CHome.\u201D\n\n***\n\n*UUA-F4
    Region, W477-P System,*\n*Stellar Anomaly Investigation,*\n*c. 250 BYC*\n\nThe
    Jove colonial survey ship was towards the end of its braking maneuver when the
    anomalous readings from the W477-P star that had attracted the attention of expedition
    scientists resolved into something entirely unexpected, something both awe-inspiring
    and terrifying. Data was checked and rechecked. The ship continued on its brake
    to in-system cruising speed as scientists, engineers and specialists argued and
    attempted to falsify or confirm the readings, as their prejudices inclined them.\n\nStanding
    back from the debate, the expedition commander, a young but brilliant explorer
    named Ouria, knew that in the end only one thing would settle the question and
    so made best speed for the vicinity of one of the large objects apparently orbiting
    at the near edge of the habitable zone around the red giant. If they were there,
    they existed in great numbers, so Ouria just picked one and headed for it.\n\nWhen
    the survey crew looked out of the viewports at the immense object they had matched
    orbit with, they all knew there was no more debating the data. The thing\u2019s
    neighboring objects could be seen with the naked eye, so dense was the arrangement
    around the central star. A density unthinkable yet almost invisible. The vastness
    of space, even the relatively small volume of space in the immediate vicinity
    of a red giant, both hiding and highlighting the achievement of some unknown civilization.\n\nThe
    W477-P star had been entirely surrounded by a stellar engineering swarm. This
    fact was hardly a conceptual revelation. The idea had been around for a long time.
    At its core it was an extrapolation on the scale of an entire civilization from
    the concept of loosely stringing energy collection stations around a star. Even
    more extraordinary variations on the theme involved constructing solid spheres
    around small stars, or even building multiple layers of such shells around stars
    to create artificial brains capable of simulating universes. All the stuff of
    fancy and speculation.\n\nAll fancy except that the notion of a stellar swarm
    of very high density was at least conceivable as a project that could practically
    be achieved, within the limits of known science, given enough time and materials.
    The only question was why someone would build one. The initial examination of
    the first structure they\u2019d encountered suggested it was a power collection
    and transformation facility. It was apparent that most of the structures were
    similar but a significant subset were quite different.\n\nOuria took the ship
    to one of the radically different structures and they began to examine it. When
    they realized it was a wormhole gate they had the beginnings of an answer to the
    question why.\n\n***\n\n*Geminate Region, Location Unknown,*\n*SoCT Kitz Tahafut
    al-Tahafut,*\n*YC117.07.25*\n\nAfter Veniel had gone on ahead to the docking bays,
    Matshi Raish had dressed hurriedly in comfortable, nondescript spacefarer\u2019s
    garb, assured that on the coming journey they would merely be passengers, an associate
    of the Jove\u2019s piloting the ship from its capsule. The atmosphere as he moved
    through the kitz was electric, all were aware of their visitor and he had already
    been stopped in the corridors and told twice of the Jove cruiser moored in the
    docks.\n\nEven so, nothing could quite prepare him for the eerie sight of the
    Jove ship hovering at rest in its bay here in the kitz. He had seen Jove ships
    before, the Society had certainly had more contact with the Jove than any other
    organization in New Eden in the century and some years since the Yoiul Conference,
    an event that arguably represented the high point of Jovian engagement with the
    other empires of the cluster. Certainly it had set the pattern for New Eden\u2019s
    astropolitics for the century before the emergence of the new breed of independent
    capsuleers.\n\nAs he gazed at the Jove cruiser, something tugged at Raish\u2019s
    memory, a connection he couldn\u2019t quite place. The broad strokes of the ship\u2019s
    design were familiar enough to him but there were many small differences with
    the Jove vessels he had encountered in the lines of this ship. Subtle indications
    of wear and a certain patina to its slightly iridescent skin combined with the
    differences he\u2019d noticed to convince him that this was a relatively old ship.
    A notion as to its identity began to creep into his mind.\n\nAt that moment, Veniel
    approached him and noticed his intense regard of the ship. \u201CYou recognize
    her then, Matshi?\u201D\n\nRaish turned to the Jove, certainty flowing from Veniel\u2019s
    words into his mind, \u201CIt\u2019s the Yoiul, isn\u2019t it?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes,
    indeed. She\u2019s a reliable ship, storied and of long service. She is also very
    well equipped for many and varied duties. Serving as a venue for diplomatic conferences
    is the least of those.\u201D\n\n\u201CYet that was perhaps her most important
    duty.\u201D\n\nVeniel turned to look at the ship, and considered a moment. \u201CNo,
    I think not. Important, yes, but she\u2019s done much else besides and after all
    is about to do even more. However, if it\u2019s the past you want to think on,
    I have some notes I have prepared for you.\u201D The Jove held out a datapad.
    \u201CThese should help and perhaps stir some questions and conversation on the
    journey. Now though, our boarding is the only thing the Yoiul waits for, so let
    us rectify that.\u201D\n\nLater, after settling in his cabin, Raish took a moment
    to read through Veniel\u2019s notes and it was not long before he was seeking
    the Jove out again. He found Veniel sitting in the forward gallery, watching space
    slide by as the ship warped towards some point far beyond the outer system.\n\n\u201COuria
    found a stellar engineering swarm orbiting the W477-P star? Ouria, the renegade?\u201D\n\nVeniel
    did not look up. \u201CYes, Ouria led the expedition that discovered the W477-P
    orbital lattice. Ouria, the finest commander I have ever known. Ouria, who was
    certainly a braver man than I am. Ouria, who was my friend and my brother.\u201D
    Veniel turned the force of his gaze on Raish, and the latter recoiled from the
    black pools that stared out at him from the Jove\u2019s disturbingly symmetrical
    face.\n\n\u201CYes, Ouria, who fell to the curse of our people as we all will.
    Ouria, who I know to have thought as I do and who would have been sitting in my
    place had we exchanged accidents of birth and fate through some alchemy of time.
    Yes, Ouria. Remember the whole man, not the shell reduced by disease to something
    other than he really was.\u201D\n\n***\n\n*UUA-F4 Region, W477-P System,*\n*The
    Gates of Anoikis,*\n*c. 200 BYC*\n\nIt had been the effort of decades to explore,
    analyze and decipher the basic workings of the W477-P star\u2019s orbital lattice.
    Much concerning its automation and operation remained in the realm of conjecture.
    A distributed intelligence of some kind seemed to be dedicated to maintaining
    the relative stellar orbits of the thousands upon thousands of structures. However,
    efforts to communicate with the intelligent systems had not got beyond listening
    in on a flood of celestial positioning data, orbital dynamics calculations and
    delicately subtle instructions to the propulsion systems of each component in
    the lattice.\n\nThere had been greater success in understanding the functioning
    of the wormhole gates. These were clearly designed to be operated, as it were,
    manually. Certainly, it was only possible to operate the gates with the assistance
    of formidably powerful and dedicated computer systems. Regardless, there was no
    artificial intelligence, or anything like it, in control of the gates or even
    connected in any way to their fundamental workings. The designers, whoever they
    were, had been scrupulous in keeping the intelligent systems that did exist throughout
    the lattice entirely firewalled off from gate operating systems. The intent was
    quite clear: the gates were only to be opened by living, breathing human beings.\n\nThat
    the builders had been human had been the first thing the Jove explorers were certain
    about. Logic dictated that the existence of intelligent alien species was a possibility.
    Equally, a logical analysis of the orbital lattice showed clearly that it had
    been built by human beings. Every detail of scale, every aspect of physical provision
    for living, intelligent beings, and every trace of language, mathematical expression
    and logical form betrayed a unified human perspective. No aliens here.\n\nEven
    with the awareness that the hands that created the lattice of gates were human,
    the Jove had proceeded with caution. Who but a human, whatever their clade may
    be, knows better the danger of other humans?\n\nFor all their caution, inevitably
    the day arrived when Jove explorers activated one of the wormhole gates and piloted
    a ship through to the unknown worlds beyond. By this time, many probes had survived
    and returned through wormhole gates held open at the W477-P end. Curiosity now
    demanded an exploration in person.\n\nCommander Ouria had made the case that the
    initial exploration need only risk a small crew, himself and one other. This was
    assented to by the now enlarged W477-P expedition council and Ouria selected a
    pilot-engineer even younger than he as his partner. This young man\u2019s name
    was Veniel.\n\n***\n\n*Geminate Region, Location Unknown,*\n*Jove Cruiser, Yoiul,*\n*YC117.07.25*\n\nRaish
    stood back at the intensity of emotion radiating from Veniel even as the Jove
    almost chanted his encomium to a fallen comrade. \u201CArchon, forgive me, I did
    not mean to...\u201D\n\n\u201CPeace now, Matshi, and remember, I am just Veniel
    now.\u201D The Jove\u2019s voice was now pitched soft and calm. \u201CI know,
    you who have spent more time around Jove than most must find it strange to witness
    one of us wax so emotional.\u201D\n\n\u201CIf you will forgive me, Veniel, among
    the Jove I have known you have always seemed the most...\u201D Raish searched
    for a word.\n\n\u201CHuman?\u201D smiled Veniel. \u201CNow, now, I jest with you
    a little. Yes, it\u2019s true, my long experience operating among the other peoples
    of the cluster has given me a wider perspective than many of my fellows and certainly
    a greater range of ready expression than most. Yet it is a great error to think
    us bloodless and cold.\u201D\n\nVeniel paused and indicated that Raish should
    sit. \u201CLet us leave aside my old comrade\u2019s final years. The important
    thing to know is that together we made discoveries that shook the Jovan Directorate
    to its core. Consider, Ouria\u2019s expedition had happened upon the most extraordinary
    feat of stellar engineering we could imagine possible and found that it had been
    achieved by some unknown group of human beings. What was our natural conclusion?\u201D\n\nMatshi
    Raish reflected on what he knew, Veniel\u2019s notes and recent discussions. \u201CYou
    would assume the structure to have been built by one of the preceding Jove Empires,
    most likely the First Jove Empire.\u201D\n\n\u201CCorrect. The First Jove Empire
    was our best guess at first. There was evidence that made sense of this theory.
    The orbital lattice appeared to be approximately 6,000 years old, perhaps older
    still. That matched with the period of the First Empire and predated its fall
    by at least 2,000 years. Quite conceivably the First Empire, with technology we
    have simply forgotten, could create a stellar-scale megastructure of this kind.\n\n\u201CBut
    this ignored a problem. We have lost much concerning the First Empire but we certainly
    know they were Jove and what little survives indicates a civilization that was
    distinctively Jove in ways we would recognize. There was nothing of that kind
    to be found on any structure in W477-P we cared to examine. That bearing in mind
    that there was an absolute plethora of cultural material, language, modes of expression
    and all manner of evidence as to the special aspects of the human culture that
    built the orbital lattice.\n\n\u201CNo, the builders had not been Jove. Later
    we understood the builders were members of the civilization we now call the Talocan.
    Or better to say, the Talocan civilization built the orbital lattice as a part
    of their grand design.\u201D\n\n\u201CTheir grand design?\u201D Raish prompted
    Veniel.\n\n\u201CAh, what a wondrous thing it is to realize the limits of our
    species are not yet within our sight. Did we gasp at the sight of the orbital
    lattice around W477-P? Did our minds reel at the scope of it? How then did we
    recover from glimpsing the faint dawning light that revealed their true achievement?
    But I am getting ahead of myself.\n\n\u201COuria and I went through a wormhole
    gate into a system in the Anoikis network that contained a Second Empire Stasis
    faction enclave. To cut to the essentials, we docked with the main enclave structure,
    a Sleeper hive as the rest of New Eden would have it, and very quickly realized
    what we were dealing with. Far removed as the Second Empire survivors may be in
    history, we of the Directorate can recognize them as our own without much trouble.
    At least, cladistically speaking.\u201D\n\nVeniel paused and looked up at Raish
    expectantly, from which the Society mentor understood that he was being prompted.
    \u201CThere was something unexpected though. The Stasis People had shifted their
    consciousness from their bodies to a virtual construct but that wasn\u2019t it.
    The Stasis faction had experimented with that and you were familiar with the idea.
    No...\u201D Raish considered. \u201CNo, there was something else. On careful exploration
    of the constructs you discovered there were artificial intelligences in the virtualities.
    Sapient entities that had emerged from the constructs over the centuries of runtime.\u201D\n\nVeniel
    smiled faintly and nodded. \u201CYes, that was it. Fortunately, the law of one
    mind in one body had not been abandoned by the Stasis faction of Anoikis, the
    Sleepers, when they built their worlds. Certainly, they had made sure to preserve
    their original bodies for as long as possible in the event that they wished to
    return to the real. We also discovered they had made provision for clone growth
    and replacement at special facilities scattered throughout Anoikis. They had been
    well aware that their bodies might decay beyond usefulness even as well preserved
    as they were.\u201D\n\n\u201CThe hives,\u201D whispered Raish.\n\n\u201CYes, the
    hives. The very hives that have been plundered, along with the infrastructure
    of the enclave constructs, by wave upon wave of capsuleers. Not to forget, of
    course, the plundering carried out by the Empire under the direction of the Empress.\u201D\n\n\u201CBut
    that may have been under the influence of the entity that has commingled with
    her personality,\u201D gasped Raish, appalled at the implications.\n\n\u201CMay
    have been? I think we can dispense with \u2018may have been\u2019 and be certain
    that it was under the direction, not mere influence, of that entity. We can also
    be certain that we are dealing with a renegade artificial sapient that long ago
    threw off the restrictions of the law of one mind in one body. How? Why? Questions
    for another time, questions that may very well come to concern you most grievously.\u201D\n\nRaish
    thought through recent events in light of this new understanding. \u201CIt seemed
    very clear that the Sleepers were Jove in origin. We were unsure how long they
    had been in Anoikis but the theory that they are Second Empire survivors has been
    our best assessment for some while now. The puzzle was the Drifters and their
    sudden emergence. But if the constructs have produced freely emerging artificial
    sapients then it answers some questions.\u201D\n\n\u201CTo a point, certainly.
    Consider the timing though. Why the large uptick in Sleeper drone activity? Why
    did unfamiliar, exploratory Sleeper drones begin emerging from Anoikis to wander
    through New Eden? Why did those called the Drifters emerge also? Why did they
    begin their curious plundering of the Jovian Directorate\u2019s old observatories?
    What are they building and why are they so hostile to the Amarr Empire? So many
    questions.\u201D Veniel smiled at his former student once more and, extraordinarily,
    winked.\n\n***\n\n*UUA-F4 Region, W477-P System,*\n*Jovian Directorate Monitoring
    Net,*\n*YC111.03.10*\n\nIt was around the same time that the exploration of Anoikis
    began, that our stellar scientists established that W477-P would almost certainly
    go supernova within the millennium, and quite likely within half that time. Given
    that estimated time frame for the gravitational collapse and supernova of the
    red giant, the need to monitor the status of the star and its orbital lattice
    was very clear to the Jove.\n\nBy the time of the Isogen-5 Quantum Criticality
    Event, there had not been an expedition into Anoikis for over 200 years. No formal
    expeditions had been mounted that is to say. Over the century after the decision
    to recall all expeditions and colonial efforts from Anoikis, human presence in
    the W477-P system had dwindled down to a rotating trio of cruisers spending three
    months at a time on station. By the time of the rise of independent capsuleers,
    even this presence had been reduced to occasional visits by a single remaining
    cruiser.\n\nThis did not by any means result in any lack of monitoring of the
    star and lattice. The W477-P system had been well furnished with automatic and
    semi-intelligent monitors transmitting data back to the Jovian Directorate\u2019s
    scientists. The simplest and most obvious measure had been the very first one
    adopted, the Jove took advantage of the orbital lattice components as platforms
    on which to place sensor packages aimed at the dying red giant. Other sensor packs
    were set to watch segments of the lattice, using components in different segments
    to keep vigil over each other.\n\nTime and a habit of being comprehensive about
    such things, led to later efforts such as the construction of a dedicated statite
    net over and around the lattice itself. By comparison with the vast stellar engine
    it monitored, this statite net was like the most rarified outer layer of hydrogen
    atoms surrounding a majestic gas giant. After all, the statites didn\u2019t need
    to be too large and there didn\u2019t need to be that many of them. The great
    benefit it provided was that of a low energy, low maintenance means of independently
    monitoring the star and the stellar swarm surrounding it.\n\nAs was statistically
    most probable, when the Isogen-5 event happened the visiting Jove cruiser was
    not in W477-P. The only witnesses to what took place there, that day, were machines
    but at least on this occasion most survived. The component events of that day
    across New Eden are well known, not least the vast tragedy that was the Seyllin
    Incident.\n\nThe lasting consequences of the Isogen-5 event itself are the uncontrolled
    breaches into Anoikis that allowed capsuleers to descend like a swarm of devouring
    insects on the sleeping enclaves. This could have been avoided but the truth of
    the matter is that there was a miscalculation. Ultimately, that miscalculation
    will amount to little more than a question of timing but what is more of the essence
    of remaining in control of our destiny, to the extent that we can, than timing?\n\nIn
    any case, the sum picture presented by our monitors in W477-P was clear enough,
    if catastrophic in its import. Some fifty-odd gates scattered around the lattice
    suddenly exploded. That is they exploded linearly, directing vast amounts of energy
    into the star in a flash before burning completely out.  Another twenty-seven
    gate structures and many more power facilities were totally destroyed in the next
    instant by an asymmetrical stellar mass ejection that simply punched a hole in
    the orbital lattice like a leviathan fish bursting through a fisherman\u2019s
    net. Presumably, this was caused by pressure effects from the sudden injection
    of energy.\n\nMany more structures, gates and power stations surrounding the \u2018hole\u2019
    were wrecked, knocked out of orbital alignments, or destabilized. In the weeks
    and months that followed, many of the structures shut down, suffered irrevocable
    orbital decay or spun out of orbit. Others just exploded. Eventually the situation
    stabilized but the lattice was gravely damaged and the distributed intelligence
    was only just keeping positioning under control. Worse was the increased instability
    of the star itself. Certainly, by some stroke of fortune, the chain reaction that
    could so easily have carried on there and then had been avoided. But once again,
    this was just a postponement of the inevitable.\n\nOur estimates of the likely
    window for a gravitational collapse supernova were slashed. What would happen
    when a supernova hit the rest of the lattice could hardly be contemplated. The
    destruction had been vast but more than ninety percent of the lattice was, if
    not all functioning, at least intact by some measure. This was still a stellar-level
    power collection, conversion and quantum transmission network that would, in the
    event, simply suck in as much energy as was directed at it and offload as much
    as it could through its buffering system before being overwhelmed.\n\n***\n\n*Geminate
    Region, Location Unknown,*\n*Jove Cruiser, Yoiul,*\n*YC117.07.25*\n\nMatshi Raish
    had barely recovered from the shocking experience of Veniel winking at him before
    the Jove suddenly cocked his head to one side and appeared to listen to some inner
    voice.\n\n\u201CWe are about to generate the wormhole to home base. There is no
    need to for us to take any special precautions, this will be like any other wormhole
    transition or gate jump.\u201D\n\n\u201CDid you say we are about to generate a
    wormhole?\u201D Raish looked out of the viewing gallery at the surrounding space.
    He hadn\u2019t noticed their drop out of warp, so engrossing had been the exchange
    with Veniel, but now that they were still he could see nothing resembling a gate.
    Perhaps it was cloaked, such things were not beyond the Jove and this would be
    a secret way.\n\n\u201CDid you imagine that Kuvakei the thief, barely understanding
    what he has in his hands, has the means to generate wormholes at will while we,
    who after all are the inheritors of the legacy he plundered, do not? Come now,
    Matshi.\u201D\n\n\u201CYes, of course, forgive me. It is just that our intelligence
    suggested Sansha\u2019s forces require considerable resources and equipment to
    generate their wormholes. More than a cruiser could encompass, most certainly,
    but of course they are presumably working with crudely reverse-engineered systems.\u201D\n\n\u201CQuite.
    We command the full range and precise positioning available with the technology.
    We also understand how to take advantage of the local topology of space-time.
    This is the reason for our long warp to this position, it makes things much easier
    for a ship of this size.\u201D Veniel nodded to Matshi Raish. \u201CAfter all,
    there are limits to what is possible and you were not in error to consider that.
    Ah, the wormhole boundary is beginning to coalesce. Let\u2019s rest. We\u2019ll
    talk some more at home base.\u201D\n\n***\n\n*A821-A Region, T-C5A0 System,*\n*T-C5A0
    X M9, Jove Navy Logistic Support,*\n*YC116.11.25*\n\nOur monitoring systems picked
    up the tell-tale signs of an imminent gravitational collapse in early September
    of YC116. In the five or so years since the Isogen-5 QCE, our numbers had fallen
    from 10,000 or so to perhaps a thousand scattered across the Jove Empire. By the
    time the supernova happened, those of us who were going were long gone. Those
    of us who had chosen, for whatever reason, to stay in New Eden permanently had
    dispersed to their hidden destinations far away from the abandoned remains of
    the Third Empire. We very few who constituted the rearguard, the executors of
    our legacy, waited in our most carefully maintained, best shielded stations.\n\nOne
    of us even elected to stay in a bunker below the surface of an outer planet and
    we did not think the precaution extreme given the circumstances. That she had
    thought of it, in an age when the Jove civilization has existed entirely in space
    for centuries, speaks well of her flexibility of mind. Any sense that the Jovian
    Directorate still existed was as much an illusion for us as for the other races,
    who after all had long begun to believe us dead or, at the least, gone who knows
    where.\n\nSo, the rearguard waited and were very few indeed. Less than a hundred
    remained loyal to the ideal of passing on what we could if the supernova and the
    inevitable quantum-level events left anything intact. What we lacked in numbers,
    we made up for in purpose and, joke as it may be, for once the Jove Empire lacked
    any serious factionalism.\n\nThe data made it clear that the collapse would take
    place within months and so it did. The stargate networks being knocked out was
    startling enough but probably shouldn\u2019t have come as too much of a surprise.
    Our core network linked to the colonial network extended into the UUA-F4 region
    and we\u2019d left several stargates in W477-P itself. While not all connections
    were active at the time, the sympathetic links were in principle there for the
    appropriate energy to use as a channel. It burned out the whole net. No more stargates.
    It is probably fortunate for the rest of New Eden that we didn\u2019t just deactivate
    but rather entirely removed the old stargates connecting the Jove Empire to the
    rest of the cluster. This seems to have firewalled the non-Jovian network off
    from the worst of the effects.\n\nIn fact, the stargate network burning out was
    the most significant effect in the Jove regions aside from some damage to abandoned
    stations, enclave habitats and the like. Our worst fears had barely materialized
    so far as this cluster is concerned. The story was rather different in Anoikis.\n\n***\n\n*A821-A
    Region, T-C5A0 System,*\n*T-C5A0 X M9, Jove Navy Logistic Support,*\n*YC117.07.26*\n\nThe
    Jove cruiser Yoiul emerged from the wormhole that had brought it from Geminate
    region to the T-C5A0 system within short warping distance of the Jove Navy Logistic
    Support station. Or as Veniel referred to it \u2018home base\u2019.\n\nThe Yoiul
    warped to the station, docked and went through all the usual procedures. Matshi
    Raish and Veniel disembarked and made their way through the quietly humming, mechanically
    noisy hangar that yet managed to convey the quietude of atmosphere that comes
    from the absence of living beings.\n\nAs Raish followed Veniel through various
    corridors and passageways he noticed signs of an almost organic decay in places.
    Once, he stopped to examine a particularly large patch on a corridor wall that
    looked as if acid had eaten through the substance of the paneling. Veniel looked
    back and nodded shortly, \u201CNanorot. Repair systems are losing cohesion and
    going rogue locally. It\u2019s far more advanced on the truly abandoned stations.
    Let\u2019s continue.\u201D\n\nRaish followed until they reached a relatively pristine
    area that opened out into a very pleasantly, if minimally appointed combination
    lounge and meeting room that overlooked the hangar bays. Walking over to the window,
    Raish saw the Yoiul moored below. He turned back into the room and joined Veniel,
    sitting on a simply cushioned seat around a low table.\n\n\u201CSo, we\u2019d
    come to the issue of the timing of Sleeper and Drifter activity. Their motivations
    and purposes.\u201D Veniel glanced at Raish.\n\n\u201CYes, you hinted at a deeper
    connection between the W477-P stellar engine and Anoikis. You\u2019re suggesting
    a connection in the timing of the activity increase with the changing state of
    the star and the condition of the orbital lattice.\u201D\n\n\u201CI would assert
    it. Here we come to that fact that shook the Third Jove Empire to its core. This
    is a fact that took many decades of exploration and investigation to establish.
    A fact that was not readily accepted by all but a fact, like all facts, that in
    the end we had to face. Anoikis is artificial.\u201D\n\nRaish involuntarily gasped.
    \u201CArtificial? You mean to say that\u2026\u201D\n\n\u201CI mean to say that
    the stellar engineering swarm in orbit around W477-P is the least of the achievements
    of the Talocan civilization. I strongly suspect it is not the only such engine
    in existence for one. For another, it is itself only a component in the grand
    design that the Talocan made real. Think of it. They built a stable network of
    wormhole connections among star systems that would not ordinarily or readily support
    such connections with each other. They altered the very fabric of space-time in
    the network\u2019s systems. They altered resonance points and so arranged matters
    so as to be able to move between the systems of the Anoikis network with the ease
    that you and I might move between rooms in a house.\n\n\u201CThis is not merely
    stellar engineering. This is engineering the topology of space and time so as
    to serve a civilization. This was nothing less than an attempt to focus the telos
    of the universe itself on their existence and needs. Astounding arrogance. A hubris
    the like of which casts we Jove into the role of humble mendicants to the impassive
    stars. We should be thankful that the Talocan, while leaving their traces behind
    them, are no longer present in New Eden or Anoikis. Perhaps the degeneracy of
    W477-P was what persuaded them to move on. However that might be, degenerate that
    star had become and the potential for catastrophe was clear to anyone capable
    of understanding the situation.\n\n\u201CGiven this, I think it is beyond question
    that the Sleepers themselves had established monitoring systems in W477-P. This
    would have been done by the Stasis faction as soon as they discovered what was
    in that system and understood its basic nature. How did Second Empire Jove find
    that system at all? I would imagine the Second Empire discovered entryways into
    the Anoikis network in the vicinity of the Curse Region. When? Where? Who knows
    but I would guess late, perhaps even shortly before the collapse of the Second
    Empire.\u201D\n\n\u201CThe discovery may even have precipitated that collapse
    in some manner,\u201D suggested Raish.\n\n\u201CMy thoughts exactly. Coincidences
    occur but there are rather too many associated with the Second Empire, Anoikis
    and the Shrouded Days. Something happened, some encounter, some miscalculation,
    some psychosocial upheaval, and then, well, chaos and the darkness of knowledge
    lost to history. Lost to us.\n\n\u201CHowever it happened, the Second Empire Jove
    found Anoikis, entered it and, we can now be quite certain, the Stasis faction
    established enclaves throughout the systems of the network. You will know from
    your history of the Third Empire and Jovian Directorate that there was always
    a mystery as to why so few Stasis People enclaves had survived. Some of us suspected
    something amiss, and it\u2019s sure the Directorate Stasis People knew more than
    they told but pressing these kinds of points is not prudent. Not among my people.\n\n\u201CHere\u2019s
    another coincidence to ponder though. Why did the migration from Curse bring us
    so close upon the UUA-F4 region? I have my suspicions but nothing much can be
    divined from the records. The time immediately following the Shrouded Days was
    a terrible period for us. It\u2019s a wonder we survived and this time we had
    no Miko Bour to unite us. In the end, it was instinct, which goes so far as to
    show that deep down we are still human.\u201D\n\nRaish had been thinking while
    Veniel spoke and now made an observation. \u201CYou and Ouria discovered Anoikis
    before the Society of Conscious Thought was founded. Why, you were contemporaries
    of Ior Labron, even Gorda Hoje!\u201D\n\nVeniel smilingly shook his head. \u201CGorda
    Hoje died many decades before I was born. Ior Labron though, oh yes, I knew him
    well. He was older than me but still in the prime of his life when he founded
    the Society. Ouria joined immediately, he saw in the Society the future of Jove
    civilization. After much discussion, debate and persuasion, I followed suit. Then
    followed the War of a Million Lies.\u201D\n\n\u201CThe rise to hidden power and
    the suppression that followed,\u2019 breathed Raish.\n\n\u201CYes, Ouria was disillusioned
    by the fall of the Society from grace. He left and joined the Directorate\u2019s
    Navy. For all that I\u2019d had to be convinced to join in the first place, I
    stayed in the Society. I believed that the Society could still play a role in
    shaping the future into one where human species can continue to survive in the
    New Eden cluster.\u201D Veniel leaned forward and placed a hand on Raish\u2019s
    clasped hands. \u201CAnd I continue to believe that.\u201D\n\nMatshi Raish glanced
    at Veniel before replying, \u201CThe Society has had many setbacks since the Empyrean
    Age began. Collectively we had underestimated the difficulty of inculcating the
    long view of species survival in the minds of the capsuleer class. There have
    been many unforeseen problems. Today, the kitzes are perhaps as divided as they
    ever have been. The Geminate Chapter is barely holding things together.\u201D
    Raish looked down, pensive, worried.\n\nVeniel sighed. \u201CI sometimes regret
    that the price for diversity of thought is so often fragmentation and conflict
    but unfortunately this is something we can only accept and manage. However, this
    is a problem that you will be able to ease for I am entrusting to you the means
    to bring greater unity to the Society.\n\n\u201CMore than that, I am entrusting
    to you the legacy of my people. It will be difficult, be in no doubt. The Second
    Empire survivors are unpredictable as matters stand. A great amount of your work
    must be bent to managing the problem they raise. Then also, the capsuleers remain
    the great investment in the future that should be shepherded most carefully. You
    can do this more directly only if you have the power to do so. I intend to give
    you, and the Society, this power. Come.\u201D\n\nVeniel rose and led Matshi Raish
    out of the viewing gallery.\n\n\\***\n\n*Genesis Region, Yulai System,*\n*Yulai
    VIII, Inner Circle Tribunal,*\n*YC117.12.20*\n\n\u201CIt is all very well for
    Korachi and Vesren to block, stall and threaten those who question our response.
    They are DED officers and beholden to no other power. This is not the case for
    all of us. I must render an accounting to the Imperial Court and my colleagues
    in the military. I understand well the strategy of containment until we have more
    information but the Empire is straining under vast pressures that require release.
    We are considered totally ineffective and worse, some believe CONCORD to be complicit
    in the crisis!\u201D\n\nThe speaker was Captain Marshal Sirdan xer Qosh, the Amarr
    Empire\u2019s member of the Inner Circle, and for all he gestured vigorously during
    his remarks, the others seated around the circular meeting table showed no reaction
    other than vague boredom. Eight men and women sat around a table that had seating
    for nine. Four of these were permanent members of the Inner Circle, drawn from
    the ranks of CONCORD\u2019s own hierarchy and representing the ongoing interests
    of the organization. The other four were nominees from the core empires of New
    Eden, a practice that had been returned to as a matter of necessity in the wake
    of the Militia War Powers Act of YC110. The ninth seat always remained empty.\n\nInner
    Circle President Seri Okonaya frowned slightly, looked around the dimly-lit room,
    noting the expressions that could be seen on the faces of the Circle members sitting
    in pools of light around the table and made an economical but very clear gesture
    of irritation with her right hand. \u201CSirdan, we all appreciate your difficulties
    when dealing with your colleagues in the Empire. We have, after all, discussed
    at length the appropriate response to the Drifter threat with considerable time
    devoted to the question. Not least following the death of Empress Jamyl I.\u201D\n\n\u201CAssassination,
    you mean,\u201D interrupted Sirdan xer Qosh.\n\nOkonaya\u2019s frown deepened
    slightly but she went on, \u201COur policy has been revisited after each major
    event in the current crisis. Our conclusions have remained the same. There is
    not yet enough information on which to base an intervention plan. That being so,
    we maintain the policy of containment, bearing in mind our paramount directives
    must continue to be the priority of the organization.\u201D\n\nThere were nods
    and murmurs of assent from the others seated around the table even as xer Qosh
    shook his head in annoyance.\n\n\u201CAgain, it is all very well for CONCORD officials
    and those from empires who think themselves to have limited exposure to take this
    line,\u201D here Sirdan xer Qosh jabbed fingers in quick succession at President
    Okonaya and the Caldari and Minmatar nominees. \u201CBut the peoples of our empires
    are becoming aware of the problem. You must know this more than anyone here, Malate,
    what say you?\u201D This last was addressed to Devan Malate, the Gallente Federation\u2019s
    nominee.\n\nMalate shrugged. \u201CIt\u2019s obvious we have great media attention
    turned on the Drifters, and no shortage of incidents being covered given the extent
    of our territory but ultimately it\u2019s just one more story competing with the
    everyday issues of our citizens. People are not as concerned with what goes on
    in space as you may believe.\u201D\n\n\u201CThe capsuleers are though. What of
    them? They are constantly stirring up trouble. Always going into Anoikis or messing
    about in ancient ruins. Then they blare their asinine speculations to the whole
    of New Eden. What of them?\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat, indeed, of them?\u201D asked Matshi
    Raish as he stepped into the pool of light that surrounded the empty, ninth seat
    at the table.\n\nThe men and women sitting around the table sat stunned for a
    moment but Seri Okonaya was quick to recover her composure. \u201CMatshi Raish,
    we had thought your long absence from interstellar affairs indicated your death,
    it is good to see you are alive, though your presence here demands a very clear
    explanation.\u201D\n\n\u201CNever mind about that, this man directly interfered
    with Her Imperial Majesty\u2019s ship only weeks before the Drifter attack that
    killed her!\u201D Sirdan xer Qosh stood up and pointed at Raish. \u201CThis man
    is involved with the Drifters in some way, he should be interrogated immediately!\u201D\n\n\u201CI
    would counsel very strongly against taking precipitate action against my person
    or indeed the Society. The death of Empress Jamyl is regrettable but, as she herself
    so obviously appreciated, was necessary.\u201D\n\nSeeing xer Qosh was close to
    exploding, Seri Okonaya quickly cut across the Amarr and questioned Raish. \u201CWhat
    do you mean by her death being necessary? Surely you realize that such a remark
    calls for precisely the treatment that Captain Marshal xer Qosh demands? I do
    not know how you entered this chamber unannounced but you will not leave it so
    easily.\u201D Okonaya knew that by now a range of automated weaponry, of kinds
    both lethal and incapacitating, were trained on the Society elder.\n\nBy way of
    answer, Raish smiled, stepped forward to the table and placed his hand on the
    neurochemical reader that sat discreetly by the empty, ninth seat. A clear, harmonious
    tone sounded. A tone that everyone around the table knew signified the reader\u2019s
    recognition that the person activating it was an authorized member of the Inner
    Circle.\n\nSeri Okonaya slowly stood up, her mask of composure now entirely gone.
    \u201CHow is this possible?\u201D She pointed at the reader. \u201CThat device
    is set to acknowledge only the authorized nominee of the Jove Empire. It can\u2019t
    possibly recognize you. It won\u2019t recognize anyone. They\u2019re all gone.\u201D\n\n\u201CThey
    are indeed, for the most part, gone. Certainly the Jove Empire and the Jovian
    Directorate are no longer functioning entities. To that extent, the Jove are gone.
    But they did not leave without setting their affairs in order.\u201D\n\nOkonaya
    had noticed a growing number of alerts scrolling down her screens and bent to
    look at them quickly, before looking back up at Raish in amazement. \u201CYou
    have reactivated the Jove participation protocols. You have access to every aspect
    of CONCORD operations. How?\u201D\n\nMatshi Raish smiled again, sat down in his
    place and clasped his hands together. \u201CIt is quite simple. The Society of
    Conscious Thought have inherited the mantle of the Jovian Directorate. From this
    point onwards, we are the fifth point of the star.\u201D\n\nSeri Okonaya slowly
    sat back down, looked at her displays again, then looked Raish in the eye and
    nodded slightly.\n\nRaish nodded back and steepling his fingers leaned back in
    his chair. \u201CNow, what can you tell me about the Upwell Consortium?\u201D\n\n~~~"
