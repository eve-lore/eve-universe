    outside the realms of the empires gives home to more than just brigands and pirates,
    it is also the home of those at the other end of the spectrum - those that dedicate
    their lives to aiding the needy. The Sisters of EVE is one of these organizations,
    perhaps the one best known. But the Sisters are about more than just aid relief.
    The foundation of the organization is firmly based in religion and science, a
    strange combination that has still gained much social ground in all the empires.\n\nThe
    Sisters were originally founded as a neutral aid organization during the Gallente-Caldari
    War. It later served the same purpose during the Amarr-Jove War and the Minmatar
    Rebellion and firmly established itself as the main humanitarian relief agency
    in the world of EVE. The Sisters have a number of bases scattered around, almost
    all of them are located near popular trade routes, yet outside empire borders.\n\nBut
    the Sisters do more than just come to the aid of those in need. They are also
    devoted practitioners of their religious beliefs, which center around the EVE-gate.
    The Sisters belief that this \u2018relic from god\u2019, as they call it, holds
    the key to the universe and are determined to unlock it, in order to bring \u2018everlasting
    peace under god\u2019s guidance and guardianship\u2019 to the world of EVE. The
    Sisters maintain that god resides at the other side of the gate and from his domain
    he guides the lives of those that belief in him and keeps them out of harms way.
    The Sisters have large followings in all the empires (even some Jovians) and the
    organization is mostly run on donations from those followers, as well as from
    some limited commercial enterprises and tariffs levied on those visiting their
    stations.\n\nIn recent years the Sisters have become more methodical in their
    approach to \u2018unlocking\u2019 the EVE-gate and have undertaken numerous scientific
    experiments on the matter. The instigator of these scientific approaches is the
    current high priestess of the Sisters, Harna Durado. She claims it is \u2018god\u2019s
    will\u2019 that the EVE-gate is studied thoroughly, with the intent of determining
    once and for all what forces are at work in and around it. As of yet the research
    being performed by the Sisters has not uncovered any stunning revelations, but
    the millions of believers belonging to the Sisters\u2019s faith are fervently
    praying for a breakthrough in the near future."
