    Kador ran her thumb over the wax of the broken seal again, feeling it move this
    time. She had spent most of the trip absently tracing its edges and it had become
    supple with the attention. It had initially struck her as strange that such an
    old tradition would be employed when untold numbers of messages could be so quickly
    relayed by electronic means.\n\nYet during the journey, as she reflected on the
    letter in her hand, she had come to appreciate the gesture. It was tactile. Real.
    Another of their private luxuries. She dug her nail into the pliable wax and thought
    about her task.\n\nHer reverie was broken by the sensation that marked their exit
    from warp speed.\n\nShe sighed. The past few months had afforded her so little
    time to herself. Her hours had been filled with a constant procession of busy
    people with concerned faces. A journey like this one had become her own private
    indulgence, even though it was at another\u2019s behest. A few hours to sit and
    think.\n\nShe gripped the letter at its end, tapping it twice on her knee before
    tucking it away in her coat and sitting forward, looking out the window again.\n\nThere
    was a light knock on the door.\n\n\u201CYes?\u201D\n\nThe Kador Family guard stepped
    in wearing a uniform that was far too immaculate for her taste. He noticed her
    look at the sheen flashing from his boots, her brows knitting, before the fierce
    eyes met his own.\n\n\u201CM\u2019lady, we\u2019re about to dock.\u201D\n\n\u201CThank
    you. Please ask them to have everything ready. I do not want to be here longer
    than I have to.\u201D\n\n\u201CAs you wish.\u201D\n\nShe stood, watching him turn
    and close the door again before she closed her gold-trimmed coat, tugged at the
    bottom of it and frowned again. She donned a black sheer robe laid out for her
    that morning, then reached up to pull its hood over her head and shoulders.\n\nDespite
    her desire for a measure of anonymity, the portly official that greeted her as
    she stepped onto the station reached out a sweaty hand to grasp hers and bowed
    slightly. She quickly scanned the corridor into the station to ensure no one along
    it might have seen the act of deference.\n\n\u201CLady Hamideh, a pleasure to,
    ah, meet you,\u201D he paused as her kohl-rimmed eyes fixed his and he was struck
    by her gaze.\n\nHer first impulse was to chastise him for not only announcing
    her but greeting her so informally. Years of training and experience won out.
    She was well practiced at showing civility to those who barely merited it. So
    she gave him a smile and tried not to withdraw her hand too quickly.\n\n\u201CAnd
    you, M. Tresein. I thank you for your courtesy and professionalism,\u201D she
    said, choosing to remind him of his duties in a way that would also flatter him.
    \u201CIt is rare to find someone that can exercise discretion under such circumstances.
    We are most grateful.\u201D\n\nHe stood tall, puffing his barrel chest out and
    smiling proudly.\n\n\u201CI understand that you don\u2019t wish to advertise your
    presence but can I offer you a quick tour of the station, M\u2019lady? As you\u2019re
    no doubt aware, we don\u2019t get many Amarr visitors.\u201D\n\nHamideh raised
    an eyebrow slightly. This man was a buffoon. It would be best to ensure a favorable
    impression of the visit against his inevitable breach of confidence.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m
    afraid I must decline, M. Tresein. Time is of the essence, unfortunately. There
    is much to attend to back home. I must also admit some discomfort, both due to
    my family\u2019s last unfortunate visit to this system and because of the relationship
    my people have had with Egonics Incorporated. Perhaps you could put me at ease
    and enlighten me about your work here as you take us to our purpose?\u201D\n\nAgain,
    the red-cheeked administrator beamed, and with a spring in his step he turned
    and gestured down the corridor, holding out his other elbow for her to take.\n\n\u201COf
    course, please come this way. We have the body secured nearby. Do you have the
    letter?\u201D\n\nWhen she held it out she saw his eyes widen with avidity as he
    reached to take it for inspection. Of course he knew about the curling black script
    at the bottom. The private message. She almost hesitated to give it to him fearing
    she was about to watch the creature lick the words right off the page.\n\nAs Tresein
    greedily read the postscript, Hamideh turned her head quickly to her security
    retinue and nodded sternly before turning back to her guide. He finished his petty
    self-indulgence, folded the letter again and wiped at the corner of his mouth
    as he handed it back. Hamideh made herself smile warmly despite a new wave of
    revulsion.\n\n\u201CI understand that you are prolific in your creative output
    at this studio?\u201D she asked, lightly resting her hand on the elbow he\u2019d
    offered.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019re one of the most productive studios in the entire
    corporation, m\u2019lady!\u201D he replied excitedly. He then proceeded to babble
    for the entire ten minutes it took to reach their destination. Her bodyguards
    looked about them as they walked, taking in every detail and examining every face
    that turned towards them. For her part, Hamideh thought back to the previous day.\n\nShe\u2019d
    been called to Uriam\u2019s side with some urgency. When the Order of St. Tetrimon
    admitted her to where the Royal Heirs were being sequestered, she was told what
    was happening.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t eaten or slept for over a standard day. After
    months during which he\u2019d showed no signs of fear or ill humor after losing
    in the Succession Trials, suddenly he\u2019d shut himself in and refused to entertain
    any visitors. His only request had been for his heir-elect to attend him.\n\nEven
    the small group of choral singers that he\u2019d requested to have at his beck
    and call to regale him with divine song had been sent away. There were no more
    extravagant dinners with rare delicacies. No more requests for books and art,
    or even the holoreels delivered by Gallente guests that he\u2019d once enjoyed.
    The Kador Family poet that had been visiting with wine and laughter had been turned
    away with disturbing finality.\n\nThe general concern was that Uriam had finally
    acknowledged what was to happen to him and it had caused some kind of collapse.
    Hamideh had thought this at first when she\u2019d entered his darkened quarters
    and found him in a rather disheveled state, wearing the previous day\u2019s clothes
    and staring blankly out the window from where he sat on the floor, leaning against
    an ornate couch. She\u2019d had to raise her voice before he even acknowledged
    her presence in the room.\n\nAfter a pause he\u2019d explained himself. Slowly.
    Still sitting on the floor. She\u2019d wondered how long he\u2019d been there.
    He did not smell of his usual scents this time. Eventually, he\u2019d picked up
    the letter with its broken wax seal from the floor beside him. Picked it up and
    handed it to her before telling her what he wanted. He had a task for her. His
    last request.\n\nShe tapped the folded paper against her leg again with her free
    hand, as if to focus her attention back to the moment.\n\n\u201C...and that\u2019s
    what I understand to be the Empire\u2019s most significant disagreement with Egonics,
    specifically,\u201D Mr. Tresein finally finished, stopping and gently withdrawing
    his elbow. As she withdrew her own hand she noted the plain grey blast doors and
    the security officer standing on guard beside them.\n\nHamideh had not truly been
    listening but she\u2019d used half an ear for form\u2019s sake, keeping her head
    down in her hood as they\u2019d walked through the corridors of the station. When
    her host paused she simply nodded and covered her lack of attention by feigning
    thoughtful consideration of his words.\n\n\u201CI believe you have it right, Mr.
    Tresein. I thank you for your perspective.\u201D She cleared her throat. \u201CNow,
    is she in here?\u201D Hamideh pointed to the doors, hiding her impatience.\n\nTresein
    had been so caught up in what he actually believed was an opportunity to make
    inroads into the Amarr market for Egonics Inc. that he seemed to have forgotten
    the purpose of her visit. He\u2019d paused with his hands behind his back, waiting
    for her response to his pitch, before her gentle reminder of her actual business
    here.\n\n\u201COh. Yes. Ahem, right in here,\u201D he said, remembering himself
    and pressing his thumb to the security reader by the doors. As the doors opened
    with a faint hiss, three more security officers waiting inside the storage bay
    beyond got to their feet from a scattering of low crates they\u2019d been lounging
    on. One of them hurriedly threw something on the floor, stepping on it with his
    heel, while another rather unsubtly attempted to waft away the blue haze around
    them. The last of them ignored all that, adopted a stone-faced demeanor and walked
    over to the casket that occupied the center of the bay.\n\nIt was suspended off
    the ground on a small maglev trolley, and it descended slightly as Hamideh Kador
    reached out to the small glass window in the lid. Even though the window was somewhat
    frosted with ice on the interior, she could still clearly see the exceptionally
    pale face within. The clarity was such that she even noticed the thin layer of
    frost on the skin and small crystals of ice in the dark eyebrows.\n\nHamideh thought
    she looked beautiful.\n\n\u201CThank you again, M. Tresein,\u201D Hamideh said,
    turning back to the odious creature. \u201CWe\u2019ll take her back to Amarr forthwith.
    She is keenly awaited.\u201D\n\n\\***\n\nIn the Scriptures, there is a tale of
    a place of battle near the Great Interior Desert on the continent of Ves-Udor.
    When the Amarr launched their Reclaiming to conquer the Udorians and other peoples
    of Athra there were many famous battles and countless notorious acts of war, but
    within the Sarum Family, Satach\u2019s Spite is remembered above all.\n\nAlthough
    seldom mentioned among the commoners, except perhaps to illustrate some lesson
    of faith, there were times enough when Udorian armies defeated the people of Amarr,
    routing God\u2019s armies. One such defeat left a Sarum general named Satach encircled
    by the enemy, cut off from the bulk of the retreating Amarrian army, with only
    a thousand men at his command. Fighting for their lives, they succeeded in breaking
    through the Udorian lines and found refuge in a region of deep canyons.\n\nIn
    one of the valleys, Satach found a deep set of caves large enough to conceal his
    entire force. They hid there, tending to their wounded while hoping that relief
    would come. After a month had passed, Satach knew that no-one would come to rescue
    his company. He kneeled in one of the cave\u2019s springs of water and asked God
    to help him and his men.\n\nThe Scriptures say that the water turned into blood
    for all the men to see, and Satach knew that his divine calling remained as it
    had always been. He was chosen to slay God\u2019s enemies, and God had granted
    him the perfect home to strike from.\n\nFor the following seven years, Satach\u2019s
    force mounted a campaign of careful but ruthless raiding against the Udorians,
    far behind the enemy\u2019s lines. Throughout these years, the location of the
    cavern remained a most carefully kept secret. It was only on the eve of Satach\u2019s
    relief by a resurgent Amarr army that his location was betrayed, after the Imperial
    envoy that had met with the Sarum general was captured by an Udorian scouting
    party.\n\nWhen the Amarr Empire\u2019s force arrived, they were merely in time
    to witness the final act of a devastating Udorian assault against the outnumbered
    Sarumites. Despite their arrival and intervention, Satach\u2019s company was slaughtered
    to a man. But for every dead soldier from Satach\u2019s company there were eleven
    dead Udorians. The dead filled the entire valley floor and inside the caverns
    the holy spring was once again filled with blood.\n\nThe Empire\u2019s relief
    troops found that the cave had been carved into a massive subterranean fortress,
    and a beautiful chapel had been built around the pool where Satach had prayed.
    The location was given over to the Sarum Family as a fief in perpetuity, and remained
    a prized fortress and sanctuary for millennia despite its poor location. Over
    the years, the entire cliff the cave was set in was carved into beautiful artwork
    commemorating the battles of Satach\u2019s company, and the valley was named for
    his long campaign of bleeding the Udorians. It was even said that the canyons
    received their red color from the blood of the Udorians slain in the final battle.\n\nBut
    with the coming of the modern age and the interstellar expansion of the Amarr
    Empire, most places like the Carved Fortress of Satach\u2019s Spite were forgotten.
    There were new shrines, new holy sites, and new splendors of creation to which
    the devout might make pilgrimage. Only the Sarum Family continued the practice
    of journeying to the ancient place, to drink from the holy spring and to remember
    the holy purpose of their house.\n\nAnd sometimes, it served as home to those
    honored lords and ladies who wished to seclude themselves.\n\n\\***\n\nThe King
    gazed out over the parapet of his castle onto the battlefield below. So many bodies
    had been dragged from the field, and yet more would die before the day was at
    an end. He could hear the desperate timbre in the voice of the bishops promising
    the glory of God to the few haggard knights and peasant soldiers standing firm.
    But the black army on the opposite rise spoke more firmly even in its absolute
    silence. Promising death and destruction.\n\nThe sun was setting. The King gazed
    out at his opposing equal, finding little comfort in his knowledge that this was
    the last day for the both of them.\n\nThis contest was merely a formality.\n\n\u201CWho
    are you playing, Merimeth?\u201D the King\u2019s advisor asked. Merimeth Sarum
    startled awake from his reverie and rubbed his weary eyes. The bronze spears of
    the sun\u2019s light stabbed at him across the desert, illuminating the vast chamber
    of red stone. He felt exhausted.\n\n\u201CKhanid,\u201D Merimeth replied. The
    other snorted with blatant disgust, nearly spitting on the intricately carved
    floor before remembering himself and where he stood. This was the chamber of their
    ancestors. It would be dishonorable to treat it so.\n\nMerimeth cradled his head
    in one hand, resting his elbow heavily on the table while his other hand idly
    counted the few remaining pieces he had at his disposal. The game was definitely
    lost, that much was clear. It had been for months. He might be able to punish
    the black king with a spiteful final offensive, but the Sarum lord found that
    he preferred this state of the board. A day of inevitable doom frozen before the
    sun might set.\n\n\u201CI fear he has you beat, my liege.\u201D\n\n\u201CIt seems
    that way,\u201D the Heir Sarum sighed and looked up at his successor. Arrach stood
    between two of the room\u2019s mighty pillars. His hands were folded behind his
    back, his face held towards the endless desert. The sunlight gilded his iron grey
    hair and cloaked him with a long shadow. Merimeth thought that the man suited
    the room much better than himself.\n\n\u201CI haven\u2019t been here since I was
    a child,\u201D Arrach said, as he gazed out at the desert the tower loomed over.
    It was much newer than the ancient fortress underneath, this tower, being part
    of the more extravagant palace that had been constructed atop the cliff which
    Satach\u2019s fortress was carved into. \u201CMy mother lived here for a time.\u201D\n\n\u201CDid
    you do as I asked?\u201D\n\n\u201CI have carried out your last request as instructed,
    my liege,\u201D Arrach bowed, bending at the waist just enough for protocol\u2019s
    sake. As he returned to his habitually ramrod straight posture, he withdrew something
    from his belt and held it out. \u201CAnd I have brought you this.\u201D\n\nArrach
    stepped over to where Merimeth sat and placed a small, intricately fashioned golden
    scepter in the middle of the game board. Carved with images of war and glorious
    triumph, it was a smaller version of the artfully sculpted pillars that lined
    the room\u2019s open wall. Merimeth ran a trembling finger over the golden images.
    Such a ritual item would seem to be a fitting addition to his funerary dress.\n\n\u201CAre
    we in such a hurry that we disregard tradition?\u201D Merimeth asked.\n\n\u201CThe
    tradition of honor goes before all else. This is a symbol of our house.\u201D
    Arrach lectured with a stern tone. Looking up at him, Merimeth felt like a child.
    He would rather look away. Grasping the scepter tightly, he let his thumb trace
    one of the rings that circled it.\n\n\u201CI didn\u2019t ask for any of this.\u201D\n\n\u201CYet
    here you are.\u201D Arrach observed, and turned away to regard the desert once
    more.\n\nOut beyond the ancient fastness made palace, a brand new temple had been
    erected on the desert plain. A mile-long promenade of black glass had been melted
    and formed out of the sand itself. At its end, a great stone ziggurat rose like
    a crystal from the dunes. Preparations had been underway for some time and neared
    completion.\n\nCrowds of pilgrims and, well, mere onlookers were already encamped
    under the hot sun in pavilions kept cool by cunning artifice. The floating pavilions
    of the Great Houses and the Emperor Family hung above all. House banners crossed
    with mourning bands billowed next to the Imperial black and gold. Aside from these
    latter, only the copper and tin banners of Tash-Murkon displayed no funeral trappings.\n\n\u201CDo
    they think this is honorable? These gaudy gallows? This gross misuse of holy technology?\u201D\n\n\u201CI
    suppose they expect us to go out in style.\u201D Merimeth did not look out. He
    had endured months as a spectator to the preparations already.\n\n\u201CStyle?
    This is an insult. We are Amarr. We do not burn men on stage to entertain the
    audience,\u201D Arrach growled.\n\nAn image of a city burned to its foundations
    as an example to all flashed through Merimeth\u2019s mind but his reply was mild,
    \u201CWe are slaves to providence, as are all.\u201D The Sarum heir was not inclined
    to fence with Arrach, already tiring of the other\u2019s ranting jabs.\n\nArrach
    turned to look back at the lord of his house. \u201CSome of us more than others.
    You have been bound by others all your life, Merimeth. Now you have a final chance
    to prove that you are the true master of your life.\u201D\n\n\u201CWe\u2019re
    all dead anyway. Is there really any point to symbolic gestures?\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat
    are pawns or kings but symbols? Yet symbols can change, my liege. At the board\u2019s
    end, the pawn can show its true strength: if only as a last act of defiance against
    a cruel fate.\u201D\n\nMerimeth frowned and met the older man\u2019s gaze. \u201CI
    have never known you to outright insult me, Arrach, but comparing me to a piece
    in a game may be the closest you have come.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou think you are the
    player of this game, my liege? Need I remind you who it was that ordered the construction
    of this grotesque spectacle?\u201D Arrach gestured out, toward the setting sun
    and the ritual field. \u201CWho set you on the path that led you here today? Who
    marked your ear for slaughter?\u201D\n\n\u201CWould you rather it be you sitting
    in this chair? And me chiding your impotence?\u201D\n\n\u201CAt least I would
    know the path of honor when it was offered to me!\u201D Arrach planted both hands
    heavily on the table. The pieces jumped on the board. The white king nearly toppled.
    \u201CI would know my choice.\u201D\n\nMerimeth grasped the scepter tight. His
    knuckles pale, his eyes hot with fury. \u201CAnd what if I choose to just accept
    my fate and walk the mile in peace? Would that not be my own choice?\u201D\n\nArrach
    stepped back, his deferential composure yet contriving to subtly display his contempt.
    \u201CNo my lord, that would be committing to the role your aunt wrote for you.\u201D\n\nMerimeth
    slumped back into his lonely chair. He let the golden scepter rest in his lap,
    a vessel adrift on a billowing sea of blood red robes. \u201CWhen every choice
    is death, the force of these points as to who has made the choice are lost on
    me. Go now, Arrach. You fulfilled your duty. Leave me in peace. God be with you.\u201D\n\n\\***\n\nSatach\u2019s
    Fountain had changed much since the days of the Athran Reclaiming. Once it had
    been a natural spring of mountain water running through a cleft of stone. Centuries
    ago someone had carved it \u2013 at with some stage of the massive fortress\u2019s
    embellishment \u2013 to take the shape of the First Prophet offering a bottomless
    jug of truth to the masses thirsty for deliverance. The trickle poured into a
    pool, with a soothing noise that drowned most other sound.\n\nDespite occupying
    the large central chamber of the ancient holdfast, the fountain was a private
    and peaceful place. Aside from the countless statues of saints and commemorated
    heroes, only two figures interrupted the emptiness of the great hall.\n\n\u201CI
    have done as you asked, Yonis. But it is not right.\u201D A trembling voice, hushed
    in fear of still statues and absent guards, yet cresting over the noise of the
    water.\n\n\u201CIt is what is necessary.\u201D A voice resonant with assured pride
    and resolve.\n\n\u201CIt is not fair to demand this of me, uncle.\u201D\n\nBefore
    the carved likeness of Dano Gheinok, First Prophet of the Amarr, Arim Ardishapur
    stood bowed under the gaze of Yonis, his uncle and lord. The latter already stood
    prepared in his death garb: a pristine white gown reaching all the way to the
    floor with little adornment.\n\n\u201CIt is what is necessary to protect the realm,\u201D
    Yonis said again, with finality. There was no point arguing. The work was already
    begun, already in motion.\n\n\u201CThis is not our way...\u201D\n\nYonis let his
    exquisitely silvered, mechanical hand brush through his nephew\u2019s brown hair.
    \u201CThe Ardishapur way is one of resolve to act in faith. Remind yourself of
    who it is that guards me here; who founded this misguided cult the demon queen
    has snared with her will. What I ask is yet a far cry from the holy deed of the
    Hand.\u201D\n\n\u201CHe is not the kind of saint I aspire to be, uncle. I do not
    wish to have this on my conscience.\u201D\n\n\u201CIt is not on your conscience,
    Arim. It is my will you execute. This is my final command, and I expect you to
    obey before you can be rid of me.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou talk of purity, Yonis. How
    can this be pure?\u201D\n\n\u201CTo wash away a stain is to take it unto yourself.
    The water that cleanses is never clean.\u201D\n\nArim looked away. His face turned
    to the pool of the spring. It was clear, but in the basin of red rock set in this
    dark chamber it might as well be blood. Yonis knelt down by his side and grasped
    his right hand. \u201CWitness your own silver hand. Remind yourself of its lesson,
    Arim. We must wear every attempted slight as a mark of honor. But we must also
    honor our jailers\u2019 inspiration: these hands are not to serve men; they are
    devoted to God.\u201D\n\nArim turned his face to meet Yonis\u2019s heavy gaze.
    Among the statues of saints and prophets, pale and dressed in radiant white, the
    Ardishapur Heir looked perfectly in place. These were his peers. Arim knelt with
    him, his metal fingers idly grasping the hem of his uncle\u2019s white robes.
    His soft weeping was muffled by the pouring water.\n\nGrasping his nephew\u2019s
    head in a caring embrace, Yonis brushed Arim\u2019s tears with delicate silver
    fingers. Smiling softly the Ardishapur Heir recited a bit of doggerel prayer that
    a mother might say over a babe.\n\n\u201CI will take your sins,<br>\nFor my soul
    is marred.<br>\nBut pray that for my works,<br>\nI am not from Heaven barred.\u201D\n"

- body: "\\***\n\nErsilia\u2019s heel strikes echoed through the winding halls of
    the northern wing of the palace of Satach\u2019s Spite. She felt lost. It had
    been months since she\u2019d visited here, and much had changed. She trusted her
    silent Tetrimon escort knew the way well enough, but few of the corridors felt
    familiar to her.\n\nOn her last visit, the place had been full of people, echoing
    with the business of the Imperial Chancellor. Today it was silent. An entire wing
    had been granted to Aritcio so that he could continue his duties as head of the
    Imperial bureaucracy despite his sequestration. Even in the enforced isolation
    he had continued to be one of the most powerful men in the Amarr Empire, and it
    had been evident. Now, though, he was surrounded only by empty offices and halls
    echoing to lonely footsteps.\n\nShe rounded a corner and knew that she was nearing
    Aritcio\u2019s personal reception hall. A familiar face waited near the door.\n\n\u201CMy
    Lady Ersilia, a pleasure to see you,\u201D said Alder Brenean with a deep bow.
    He was Aritcio\u2019s personal aide and closest confidante, a common man of the
    people. For eight years he had served arguably the Empire\u2019s most powerful
    man, but to Ersilia\u2019s eyes he seemed humble as ever. Even so, the short,
    dignified man seemed more confident than he had been when she first met him.\n\n\u201CAnd
    you, Alder. How is our lord?\u201D\n\n\u201COur lord is at peace,\u201D he said
    with a soft smile. \u201CI am the last to leave. He awaits only you.\u201D\n\n\u201CThank
    you Alder, for everything.\u201D\n\nHe nodded solemnly. \u201CIt has been my honor.\u201D\n\nShe
    watched the older man walk away, then turned to the door and steeled herself.
    After a few minutes, she opened it.\n\nThe sun of the late afternoon bathed the
    chamber in hues of orange, setting the ever sanguine stone aglow. The room had
    previously housed a small replica of the Table of the Chancellor from the Imperial
    Chancellery Court in Dam-Torsad, but now that too was gone. There were no more
    petitions to be heard, no more orders to be signed. No more business to be done,
    indeed, except that which waited beyond the flesh-hued walls of the fortress-palace.\n\nAritcio
    was nowhere to be seen, but Ersilia saw a side table set for a private dinner.
    Draped over a settee was the Imperial Chancellor\u2019s court robe of office,
    made new to be worn once. She ran her fingers over the muted details and their
    house crest sitting below the Imperial sigil.\n\n\u201CWould you join me for my
    last meal?\u201D\n\nErsilia spun around, startled. There were instincts she tried
    to curb, but today every fiber of her being was tense. She willed herself to relax
    and meet her cousin\u2019s eyes. Aritcio was standing in the doorway to his chambers,
    his attitude far more casual than she had seen in a decade. He smiled patiently,
    but his eyes were tired.\n\n\u201CYou have sent everyone home, my lord. Who will
    cook?\u201D she jabbed at him, feeling old defenses slide into place.\n\n\u201CIt
    would be my honor.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou? Since when do you know how to cook?\u201D\n\n\u201CAlder
    has been teaching me. His patience is remarkable, and I have had much free time
    lately. He has taught me how to make all my favorite foods.\u201D\n\n\u201CSo
    what will we be having?\u201D\n\n\u201CSalted Rockjaw stew with black bread.\u201D\n\n\u201CSounds
    delightful, Chancellor.\u201D\n\nAritcio laughed, and Ersilia joined in.\n\n\u201CI
    have it nearly ready. Stay here, I will be right back.\u201D\n\nAgain left alone,
    Ersilia returned to her regard of the ceremonial robe. Was it just an outfit,
    or was it a character to be worn? The honorable man, the dutiful lord, the altered
    sinner? Aritcio was a man who had been stripped naked to his very soul, and then
    clothed anew in quick-grown flesh. It was clear that he was changed, that his
    works since had been good. But still Ersilia could not quiet the panic in her
    heart when she looked at his face, or stop her hairs from standing on end when
    he spoke.\n\n\u201CWhat is the matter, Ersilia?\u201D\n\nShe took a breath, searched
    for another line of thought. One to match her hesitation. \u201CYou haven\u2019t
    asked me to complete a final request for you, Aritcio. It is tradition.\u201D\n\n\u201CI
    asked you to come here, and you did. I request that you have dinner with me. Do
    you obey?\u201D He asked with a genuinely jovial smile, as if it was their own
    little joke.\n\n\u201CI obey.\u201D She said, clenching her muscles to suppress
    a shiver, painting on a strained grin.\n\nThe meal was a quiet affair. Apart from
    some pleasantries and Ersilia commending her cousin on his newfound culinary skills,
    few words were said until the plates were clean. Ersilia could tell there was
    something on his mind, but was loath to press him. When Aritcio spoke it was in
    a quiet bashful tone, refusing to meet her gaze.\n\n\u201CIn truth, I did have
    one, real request, before I go.\u201D\n\nErsilia nodded.\n\n\u201CI need you to
    forgive me.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\n\n\u201CI need you to forgive me for the
    things I did to you.\u201D\n\nErsilia took a sharp breath and pushed her chair
    back. Her heart drummed, her brows furrowed, and her fingers balled into fists.
    Aritcio looked up from his plate and his eyes widened in shocked realization of
    the line he\u2019d crossed.\n\n\u201CI am sorry, Ersilia! I take it back! Forget
    the request!\u201D\n\nAt the sight of his expression, Ersilia was taken aback.
    She was seldom this transparent, but Aritcio had always had a way of exposing
    her true feelings. \u201CNo, no!\u201D she protested, and made to speak but hesitated.\n\nThe
    room was silent for a moment unmeasured except by their beating hearts.\n\n\u201CI
    could never,\u201D Ersilia started hesitantly. \u201CI could never forgive the
    old you for what you did. But I think you have changed. The Aritcio I shared a
    meal with has done me no harm. I can forgive the new you.\u201D\n\n\u201CIn the
    end, what more could I ask of you?\u201D Aritcio said, and together they shared
    a melancholy smile.\n\n\\***\n\nWhen Hamideh entered Uriam\u2019s rooms this time
    he was pulling the sleeve of his finely embroidered coat in the mirror. He paused
    as he saw her walk in behind him. Uriam looked more dignified and regal to her
    than he had been for some time. He was clearly going to considerable effort. She
    saw his eyes go to the black and gold urn in her arms, and heard him draw in a
    ragged breath. He closed his eyes for a moment.\n\nThen it was like he was switched
    on again and he turned, animated.\n\n\u201CHamideh, my dear,\u201D he smiled,
    walking towards her. He paused half-way and finished buttoning his cuff.\n\n\u201CUriam,\u201D
    she replied. \u201CI\u2019m glad to see you looking well. The last time I saw
    you, well, you seem better.\u201D\n\n\u201CI could say I wasn\u2019t myself, but
    that wouldn\u2019t be true now would it? Still, it could be said that you saw
    me diminished.\u201D He looked her in the eye. \u201CAs you\u2019re aware by now,
    she was everything to me.\u201D\n\nHamideh held his gaze for a moment without
    replying. Even so, she had questions.\n\nShe stepped to the nearby table and carefully
    placed the urn on it, turning the container slightly so that the small indentation
    in the lid faced him. She breathed deeply, steeling herself.\n\n\u201CUriam, you\u2019ve
    stated on many occasions that I am the obvious choice for the next Kador Heir
    despite my age.\u201D\n\n\u201CWithout a doubt.\u201D\n\nShe exhaled through her
    nose.\n\n\u201CThen why do you continue to test me?\u201D\n\nHe shook his head
    slightly. \u201CNo, my dear, no. I am assured of your suitability. Something that
    you\u2019ve only reinforced going to Ratillose yourself despite the complications
    it could cause when it becomes public knowledge. I don\u2019t test you as much
    as try to help you learn. You must conquer your own doubt, especially after today.
    Show them who you are, before they try and tell you.\u201D\n\nHamideh folded her
    arms and narrowed her eyes.\n\n\u201CThey\u2019ll be asking questions about her
    soon. He hides it from most but Tresein is at heart a climber and a schemer with
    a hunger for scandal. Word will get around.\u201D\n\nUriam tilted his head. \u201CAnd
    when it does?\u201D\n\n\u201CI\u2019ll speak the truth. If that\u2019s not what
    they\u2019ll traffic in, I don\u2019t care.\u201D\n\n\u201CExcellent,\u201D Uriam
    smiled, clapping his hands. \u201CHouse Kador has nothing to worry about.\u201D\n\nHamideh
    turned away from him and started walking around the table, looking at him sideways.\n\n\u201CIf
    I\u2019m going to speak the truth I\u2019ll need it though, cousin.\u201D\n\nUriam\u2019s
    eyes were on the urn now, his smile slowly fading away.\n\n\u201CWhat do you need
    to know?\u201D\n\n\u201CRatillose. Why?\u201D she asked curtly. Time was running
    out.\n\nHe sighed. \u201CThere were a number of reasons.\u201D\n\n\u201CI\u2019ve
    heard some. Tell me something real.\u201D\n\n\u201CAs you already know, the fact
    is that there had been talk of attempted seizures of Gallente assets. Our new
    Empress had even then spoken loosely of the rich Gallente stations floating around
    in her region. You\u2019ll need to watch her.\n\n\u201CShe spoke of Quafe, Impetus,
    Aliastra and others. I did my utmost to be a part of these speculations. I was
    unsure, though mostly against it. I didn\u2019t think it was wise but I was advised
    this was because my judgment was clouded. I already had contacts in the Federation,
    a curiosity about them, and of course I\u2019d met Jeanelle very early in my travels.\u201D
    \n\nUriam stepped forward slowly and stretched out his hands to the urn on the
    table between them. He paused, his hands trembling slightly, only a fraction of
    an inch from the urn\u2019s shining black surface before he actually grasped it,
    quite suddenly, and held it up for inspection.\n\n\u201CYou met many Gallente
    women, Uriam,\u201D Hamideh said, pursing her lips. She had moved behind him by
    now and so couldn\u2019t see his face. His body didn\u2019t even flinch at the
    jibe, however.\n\n\u201COh, you\u2019re much too clever for that, Hamideh,\u201D
    he murmured, turning his head slowly to her as she came around his other side.
    \u201CThe first after her may have been a true infatuation but it was ultimately
    born of a desire to be free of the original obsession. When it became enough evidence
    for some that I had a predilection, and I realized my first feelings had not gone
    away, it proved a convenient cover for both of us.\u201D\n\n\u201CShe must have
    loved that,\u201D Hamideh scoffed.\n\n\u201CAll of them were her,\u201D he said,
    meditating on the urn again. \u201CAnd none of them.\u201D\n\nShe shook her head,
    bemused, and looked away as she continued pacing out laps around him and the table.
    She wanted to challenge the rationalization but there wasn\u2019t the time. There
    were other questions that needed answers.\n\n\u201CAnd Grand Admiral Eturrer?
    Was he one of your contacts?\u201D\n\n\u201CEturrer was meant to provide the intelligence
    needed to convince my colleagues that assaults on the Federation would be a mistake.\u201D\n\nHamideh
    swept her hand over the flames of a candelabra as she passed it. \u201CBut he
    served quite the opposite purpose?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes, militarists and money alike
    were taken in by his talk of yet more holes in the Tripwire network. You know
    how much old iron and old gold we owed debts to by then. They wanted glory and
    the spoils. Eturrer was a catastrophe.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhich led to a series of
    events that you lost all control over. What\u2019s more, by the end of it all
    you couldn\u2019t even use the Grand Admiral as evidence that you weren\u2019t
    entirely at fault.\u201D\n\n\u201CThanks to Jeanelle.\u201D\n\nHamideh stopped.
    She bit her bottom lip, thinking.\n\n\u201CShe was getting back at you?\u201D\n\nUriam\u2019s
    brow furrowed. He didn\u2019t reply. There was a glimpse of pain on his face.\n\n\u201CHow
    did you hurt her?\u201D\n\n\u201CWe\u2019d both said it was over for good that
    time. It was the closest we would come to being free of each other,\u201D he whispered.
    \u201CMight as well try to cut out your own heart.\u201D\n\nHamideh moved closer,
    straining to hear him. Then it dawned on her and her eyes widened.\n\n\u201CUriam,
    as per her directions, after we\u2019d identified her body and returned her here
    she was cremated. The mortician\u2019s report noted a scar running from\u2026\u201D\n\nUriam
    raised a hand and despite herself she stopped. He lifted his head up, stood straight
    and tall.\n\n\u201CI don\u2019t know, Hamideh, whether I\u2019d hope for God to
    fate you with such a connection to a person that would drive you to be both your
    best and worst in a single lifetime,\u201D he looked at her solemnly. \u201CI
    have considered it both a blessing and a curse. While I cherished her more than
    my own self there were times enough that I wished she was dead. That she had never
    been.\u201D\n\nUriam held up the urn and swallowed, his voice almost breaking,
    before he pressed on. \u201CI hurt her and she hurt me. In a way, as perverse
    as it may seem, it was further affirmation of who we were to each other.\u201D\n\nHamideh
    shook her head and scowled. \u201CDid you invade Ratillose intending to move on
    to Ondree? That\u2019s where she was born, wasn\u2019t it? Was it a show of force?\u201D\n\n\u201CShe
    might have been born in Ondree, but she gave a portion of her life to Egonics
    in Ratillose. It was a gate and a memory. They attached their little spigot and
    drained her of her talent. You\u2019ve seen her words.\u201D\n\nHamideh felt the
    letter, still tucked into her clothes.\n\n\u201CSo, all those lives? All those
    ships?\u201D\n\nHe snorted. \u201CNothing so trite. As I\u2019ve explained, there
    were many reasons, numerous pressures. I misplayed my hand with Eturrer and had
    to let things go forward. At least I could direct the forces along a path that
    might have been of some benefit. And after all, the kind of thinking that led
    to the adventure was quashed.\u201D\n\n\u201CSo was your reputation.\u201D\n\n\u201CAs
    you put it, I don\u2019t care.\u201D\n\nThey both turned to the window then, hearing
    the murmuring of the crowd growing in volume as latecomers arrived and notables
    took their places.\n\n\u201CAnd what if Ratillose had been an Amarr victory?\u201D\n\n\u201CIf
    it had succeeded, well,\u201D he stared at the floor, \u201Ceveryone would have
    started to race through doors unexpectedly blown wide open. However, in the first
    strike, the entire Mobrault constellation \u2013 her home \u2013 would have been
    mine.\u201D\n\nNeither of them spoke or moved for a moment. Then the door beside
    them opened and a knight of the Order of St. Tetrimon appeared in ceremonial robe
    and mailed coif.\n\n\u201CLord Kador, it is time.\u201D\n\nUriam nodded, cleared
    his throat and then walked past Hamideh, into the corridor beyond. She stepped
    out behind him and watched him go, the sun flickering over him as he walked past
    the patterned wooden windows.\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re a fool,\u201D she eventually
    called, smiling sadly.\n\nHe spun on his heel and walked backwards a couple of
    paces, holding the black and gold urn tightly to his chest with one hand and making
    a flourish with the other.\n\n\u201CSo what else is new?\u201D he laughed. Then
    he turned the corner and was gone forever.\n\nShe pulled out the letter, read
    the curling words of its postscript again, and shook her head before going to
    her own place for the evening\u2019s ceremonies.\n\n\\***\n\nKhemon Dulsur an-Tetrimon
    sat back in his desk chair, turned towards the window and contemplated the shimmering
    sands of the desert beyond Satach\u2019s Spite. Soon enough it would be time to
    gather his charges together for their final journey. Dulsur grimaced, his task
    these past months had brought him no satisfaction and no small frustration.\n\nA
    soft chime sounded and Dulsur turned back to face the door.\n\n\u201CEnter,\u201D
    said the Grand Master of the Order of St. Tetrimon.\n\nUdo, still Paladin Senioris
    after all these years, entered and respectfully ushered into the room a man in
    richly decorated robes that spoke of high status without ostentation. The man
    was handsome though aged, smiling though having about him an air of cautious experience.
    Dulsur was well familiar with Kalefa Sufrin an-Kador, High Chaplain of the Emperor
    Family, and something about the cleric\u2019s demeanor evoked a sense of foreboding.\n\nDulsur
    stood up and walked around the table to meet Sufrin and clasp hands with him.
    \u201CHigh Chaplain, you are most welcome. That will be all, Udo.\u201D As the
    Paladin Senioris withdrew, Dulsur indicated a pair of comfortable chairs arranged
    to look over the desert plain. \u201CPlease sit, let us talk.\u201D\n\n\u201CThank
    you, Grand Master. You are well, I trust.\u201D\n\n\u201CQuite well, thank you.\u201D
    Dulsur had not seen fit to hide his unease and waited for Sufrin to reveal the
    purpose of his visit.\n\n\u201CExcellent,\u201D Sufrin glanced quizzically at
    Dulsur and his calm smile quirked wryly for an instant. \u201CI read your final
    report on the sequestration of the Royal Heirs with great interest, Grand Master.
    There was much, ah, food for thought.\u201D\n\n\u201COnly thought? What of action?
    If you read the report, then you surely must be as disturbed as I am?\u201D\n\n\u201CMy
    dear Dulsur, while I agree that certain of the interactions between Heirs and
    successors could be considered, well, unusual and that some of the final requests
    are rather peculiar, I am not inclined to alarm. It does not seem to me that any
    of the matters in the report imperil the fulfilment of the, let us say, necessary
    essentials of this evening\u2019s rite.\u201D\n\nDulsur shook his head in dismay.
    \u201CYou adopted a similar position when it came to the report, clear in its
    implications, on the Tash-Murkon assets that were in place during the trials.\u201D\n\n\u201CNow,
    Dulsur, we\u2019re surely not going to rake over those coals again? There are
    always those who can\u2019t see beyond loyalty to House and Heir. What of it?
    I\u2019m quite sure your knights would have capably thwarted any renegade actions
    had it been necessary.\u201D\n\nDulsur snorted. \u201CAnd I am quite sure of where
    the orders and the money actually came from in that case.\u201D\n\nSufrin sighed.
    \u201CIs there really any purpose in belaboring a moot point? Haven\u2019t you
    yourself publicly pledged fealty? You have been unstinting in breaking the backs
    of the heretics and fanatics who would question the divine will.\u201D\n\nThe
    Grand Master stood up and paced back and forth, his frustration evident. Turning
    back to the quietly patient High Chaplain, he pointed an accusing finger. \u201CYou
    have made me a politician, it\u2019s true. I\u2019m no longer a soldier. No more
    than you are a priest!\u201D\n\n\u201CCome now, Lord Dulsur an-Tetrimon, it\u2019s
    your office that made you that. Your office, your vocation and your predecessor.\u201D\n\n\u201CPerhaps
    so.\u201D Dulsur sat back down. \u201CBut look you, some of these men we\u2019re
    to burn this day are surely desperate. You\u2019ve read my report and know what
    each has had delivered into their hands. Do you really say that we let the affair
    proceed as things stand?\u201D\n\n\u201CI do. Take no action. Let each of them
    meet their ultimate lord in their own way.\u201D\n\n\u201CAnd what of the abomination?\u201D\n\n\u201CWell,
    he\u2019ll die too, of course.\u201D\n\n\u201CBut not his successor.\u201D\n\n\u201CI
    believe his family would withstand the loss of both of them, Dulsur. I can\u2019t
    see that there is much to be done about that situation, much as we may not like
    it.\u201D\n\nDulsur met the other\u2019s gaze and nodded. \u201CAs you wish but
    mark me well, Sufrin, there will have to be a reckoning sooner or later.\u201D\n\n\u201CThere
    is always a reckoning in the end, my dear Grand Master. But we must accept that
    our role is not always to bring that reckoning to a head.\u201D\n\nKhemon Dulsur
    an-Tetrimon raised his hand in weary assent and looked out at the early evening\u2019s
    light slanting on the ruddy sand and stone of Satach\u2019s Spite.\n\n\\***\n\n\u201CSo
    at last, it\u2019s time.\u201D\n\n\u201CIndeed.\u201D\n\nThe Khanid lords strode
    down the gilded steps to the hall of assembly together. Down there, the Heirs
    Kador and Kor-Azor were already waiting, together with Court Chamberlain Pomik
    Haromi, the ever calm Kalefa Sufrin an-Kador, and the Tetrimon Grand Master, this
    latter attended by several of his knights.\n\n\u201CI had hoped sweet Catiz would
    be here to bid you farewell,\u201D Farokh Khanid, Duke of Sib and heir to the
    Khanid Kingdom, laughed.\n\n\u201CAh, such a shame that I shall never see her
    again,\u201D replied Garkeh Khanid, King of Khanid, with a grin, play-acting a
    longing gaze of forlorn love.\n\nThey both laughed then, drawing dire glances
    from their soberer fellows.\n\n\u201CThe Duke of Sib should take his leave. The
    ceremony is about to begin, and I am certain he would wish to be seen in his place
    as crown prince of the Khanid Kingdom,\u201D Haromi chided.\n\nFarokh Khanid bowed
    deeply before the Court Chamberlain before doing the same toward his king. \u201CFortune
    speed you on your way, Majesty.\u201D\n\n\u201CThe King is dead,\u201D Garkeh
    said, smiling broadly.\n\n\u201CLong live the King!\u201D Farokh replied with
    a salute, then bowed again and left the hall.\n\nKhemon Dulsur an-Tetrimon watched
    the Duke go with barely concealed disgust, before gesturing to his knights to
    take their places by the gateway. Beyond those stone gates, banded in iron and
    gold, the noise of the crowd was reaching a new pitch of raucous anticipation
    mixed with reverential chanting.\n\n\u201CHave the Lords Sarum and Ardishapur
    gotten themselves lost?\u201D Garkeh asked, looking around for his missing peers.\n\n\u201CThey
    will be here shortly,\u201D said Dulsur tonelessly.\n\n\u201CI hope you\u2019re
    right. I wouldn\u2019t want to miss my own execution because of those two.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou
    may be assured that no such accident will transpire, your grace.\u201D\n\nKalefa
    Sufrin an-Kador turned away and looked up the stairway.\n\nThe remaining Heirs
    soon appeared, escorted down into the hall by their Tetrimon guards, making up
    a full company of ten with their fellows already present. The final march demanded
    its proper escort.\n\n\u201CWe are all assembled,\u201D Haromi said and struck
    his ceremonial staff on the tiled floor. Merimeth joined the group with open arms
    and wide strides, greeting the other lords with a pleasant smile. Yonis remained
    quiet, and kept his hands folded in the sleeves of his white robes.\n\nAfter greetings
    had been exchanged by those so inclined, High Chaplain Sufrin an-Kador addressed
    the ceremonial party. \u201CBlessed Heirs, it has been an honor serving God and
    the Empire at your side, but the time has come for our paths to part. The divine
    order demands that you take your leave of this room in God\u2019s house and take
    your places at His side. Your passing will usher in a new era in the life of Holy
    Amarr, with our great Empire prospering under the wise rule of Empress Catiz.\n\n\u201CYou
    have named the new Heirs of the Amarr Empire and by that sacred duty secured the
    Imperial Succession. Only your final duty remains. It is the sure will of Her
    Imperial Majesty Empress Catiz I that you walk the path to the Temple of Ascension,
    where you will take your places and undergo the Rite of Shathol\u2019Syn. By that
    sacred and willing act of faith you will join with blessed Jamyl and set your
    own blessings upon the people of the True Faith.\u201D\n\nGarkeh Khanid\u2019s
    sardonic grin widened a trifle and Khemon Dulsur an-Tetrimon lowered his head.\n\nChamberlain
    Haromi stepped forward and spoke to the Heirs, \u201CDo you understand your duty?\u201D\n\nAll
    five indicated their understanding and agreement, with nods and gestures of assent
    according to their temperaments.\n\n\u201CSo recognized. Go now, with God.\u201D\n\nHaromi
    struck his staff on the floor once more, five times, before the heavy stone gates
    facing the harsh desert opened, and the march began.\n\n\\***\n\nAt the end of
    the long obsidian road was a tiered temple fashioned from black stone. Along the
    face of the temple was a stairway two hundred steps high. At the top of the steps
    was a wide circular dais of pure white glass, set in a mount of gleaming metal.
    Arranged in an arc at the center of the glass circle were five ornate wooden thrones,
    each carved with the motifs of the five houses: Ardishapur, Kor-Azor, Sarum, Kador
    and Khanid. Merimeth took his designated seat in the center, with Yonis and Aritcio
    to his right, Uriam and Khanid to his left.\n\nAs they took their seats, they
    each became keenly aware of the thousands of faces eagerly awaiting their deaths.
    This was it, in these moments the entire Amarr Empire held its breath before things
    proceeded as ordained. Looming close, though not too close, the Emperor Family\u2019s
    pavilion hung perfectly still despite a gentle wind, with Empress Catiz enthroned
    in the center, surrounded by honored guests from within the Empire and beyond.\n\nUriam
    was the last to take his seat, the urn he\u2019d carried along the black path
    carefully held on his lap. As he took his place, the Tetrimon escorts stepped
    back from the arc of thrones and retreated down the steps of the ziggurat.\n\nShortly
    thereafter, the shield projectors surrounding the glass circle erupted into life
    with a low hum. An indistinct cylinder of faintly distorted light surrounded them
    and stretched into the sky. The distortion, rippling slowly like heat off the
    desert, glittered here and there as the light breeze blew sand and dust against
    it. The platform began to grow cold, and all the sounds from the crowd and ceremony
    outside were silenced. The heirs were left to themselves. Sequestered again, after
    a mile of absolute exposure.\n\nJust inside the shielding stood an hourglass,
    filled with golden sand, counting down the remaining seconds. \u201CWell, always
    nice to know when you\u2019re going to go.\u201D Khanid quipped, gesturing at
    the object and its rapidly emptying upper bulb. Yonis Ardishapur huffed in response
    and stood up, wearing a strange expression.\n\n\u201CWhat is it, youngster? Need
    to stretch your legs before the long trip?\u201D Khanid laughed and stood up as
    well. Merimeth, looking back and forth between the two men standing at the ends
    of the arc of chairs, seemed bemused. Aritcio looked concerned, and rose to stand
    in front of Yonis.\n\n\u201CSomeone should have dealt with you a long time ago,\u201D
    Yonis spat at the Khanid King, and unfolded his arms to reveal a slim blade of
    iridescent black glass in his silver right hand.\n\n\u201CYonis! No!\u201D shouted
    Aritcio and quickly stepped in with a clumsy hold that could have been taken for
    a brotherly embrace.\n\n\u201CPathetic old fool!\u201D Khanid laughed. \u201CThere
    is no world beyond this one for you!\u201D\n\n\u201CLet go of me! I refuse to
    face the Divine and my ancestors with that thing at my side! He is an abomination
    and he must be struck down!\u201D Yonis gasped, his fanatical gaze transfixed
    on the Khanid King even as Aritcio pressed against him in an iron grip.\n\nMerimeth
    stepped over to the struggling pair and put his hands on their shoulders, \u201CStop,
    my brothers, stop. Think of what you\u2019re doing. We may be seen only dimly
    through this haze but seen we are. Take this madness no further, Yonis.\u201D\n\nYonis
    looked into Merimeth\u2019s face, stricken. \u201CAritcio. He, he slipped onto
    it.\u201D\n\nMerimeth glanced down, saw the blood underfoot and shuddered. \u201CCome,
    let\u2019s help him to his seat.\u201D\n\n\u201CStop this now!\u201D Uriam cried,
    stepping over to place a restraining hand on Khanid\u2019s shoulder. His expression
    was one of horror and fear, and no small amount of anger.\n\n\u201CStay out of
    this!\u201D Khanid barked and shrugged Uriam off violently, making the Kador heir
    stagger back. The five figures froze at the sudden, tragic noise of porcelain
    shattering.\n\nFalling to his knees by his throne, Uriam gazed into a pile of
    scattered ashes and the shards of the urn. Slowly, his hands moved as if to contain
    the mess. Khanid looked down at Uriam\u2019s bowed form, then turned back to the
    others. Ariticio sat back in his throne, a hand pressed to his stomach.\n\n\u201CYou
    see, Yonis?\u201D smiled Khanid. You don\u2019t have to be concerned about the
    purity of your travelling companions! Uriam\u2019s whore won\u2019t be joining
    us after all.\u201D\n\nYonis took a horrified, convulsive step back towards his
    own throne, while Merimeth seemed to shake himself and advanced towards Khanid.\n\nKhanid
    looked puzzled as Merimeth came on, arms wide open. \u201CWhat\u2019s this, whelp?
    Come to give your elder and better a hug?\u201D\n\nMerimeth rushed suddenly forward,
    flung his arms around Khanid, brought right hand to left and pulled apart the
    Sarum Family scepter he carried with him.\n\nAs the blade entered Khanid\u2019s
    lung, he coughed and grinned once more. \u201COh! Well played, Jamyl\u2019s puppet!
    Ah, it seems we finished our game after all! Yes, well done but, um, futile and
    far, far too late.\u201D\n\nOn his knees, Uriam\u2019s voice cracked with grief
    and fury, his arms raised to the sky, as if in a final benediction, before the
    last rays of the sun disappeared behind the temple, and the sands ran out.\n\n\u201CWhy
    must you ruin all that is beautiful?\u201D\n\nThe glass platform erupted in pure
    white light, slicing the sky like a heavenly sword. Contained by the shielding,
    the tachyon siege laser beam\u2019s passage from ground to stars was soundless
    and emitted only that light symbolizing the divine will. It blazed forth for second\u2019s
    beat, then faded away, the shields dropping to reveal not a trace remaining atop
    the ritual ziggurat.\n\nAboard the Emperor Family\u2019s floating pavilion, Empress
    Catiz I leaned over to Pomik Haromi and whispered, \u201CDo make sure that the
    final cut of the official holo-record reflects clearly the, ah, fraternal love
    and deep piety our royal cousins displayed at the end. We must not allow the shield
    haze to obscure such devotion and faith.\u201D\n\nHaromi coughed, glanced over
    at Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor, who appeared to be grinning fiercely as his companion
    Keitan Yun spoke into his ear, and sighed. \u201CYes, Majesty. It shall be as
    you say.\u201D\n\n\\***\n\n*This love is so luxurious. It has also been so bittersweet.*<br>\n*I\u2019ve
    lived so much of my life longing to be somewhere else.*<br>\n*The thought of enduring
    without the respite of your company is a shadow*<br>\n*That shadow drains the
    distant horizon of all color and warmth.*<br>\n*Take me with you, beyond, and
    into the setting sun.*<br>\n*By the time you read this, I\u2019ll already be waiting.*<br>\n*Be
    brave for me, Uriam.*<br>\n*Hold me close.*  "

description: Hamideh Kador ran her thumb over the wax of the broken seal again, feeling
  it move this time. She had spent most of the trip absently tracing its edges and
  it had become supple with the attention. It had initially struck her as strange
  that such an old tradition would be employed when untold numbers of messages could
  be so quickly relayed by electronic means. Yet during the journey, as she reflected
  on the letter in her hand, she had come to appreciate the gesture. It was tactile.
