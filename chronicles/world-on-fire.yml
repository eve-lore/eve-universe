    he watched his crew slowly bring the end of the world to light, Antar found it
    increasingly difficult to see this as anything but the end of himself.\n\nA long
    time ago he had realized that the full extent of a life demanded the experience
    of both pleasure and pain; piety and indulgence. He had explored the darker side
    with fervor and reveled in what he found. With the Blood Raiders he had found
    not only the other, missing side of his own self, but fellow souls who shared
    that same drive. Religion and hedonism were finally combined in a cult to the
    individual that nonetheless presented Antar with the strongest ties he had ever
    felt to any group of people. He had found himself, home at last.\n\nPart of those
    ties had been the mutual hunger for more, which no one truly thought would ever
    be sated. It was a real but unstated pleasure of anyone's life to have a mission
    that would not be completed; for if they were to reach the end of the road, there
    would be nowhere else to go.\n\nAntar walked through the ship, inspecting its
    metal interiors. He stroked a hand over a cold wall. This dead thing was the end
    of the Blood Raiders.\n\nOnce your dreams had come true, Antar reasoned, all you
    wanted would be gone, and you would have nothing left to do but to die in resigned
    silence. The mass harvesting would fulfill every possible demand the Sani Sabik
    could possibly have for blood, and if they were to find their thirst rising to
    even greater heights, the power of this superweapon, wielded correctly, would
    establish Bleeding farms great enough to utterly quench it. They were done.\n\nAntar
    had not foreseen this end for himself. He had expected to go out in fire.\n\nSo
    when a watchful crewmember reported a Thukker vessel creeping in, and when he
    saw where the Thukker ship was headed - not for their vessel but for the drones
    and the hive - he smiled, and then grinned so wide he had to turn away.\n\nAnd
    he told his people not to worry.\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nMost
    of New Eden would never know the horror of Antar's deeds, or the bravery of the
    Thukker crew. They would only know the cataclysm which followed, and the pain
    of millions as they suffered a fate that would satiate even the most devoted Blood
    Raider's thirst for widespread destruction.\n\nThere was no pain for Antar or
    Kotan. Existence for the crewmen aboard both ships had ceased without their being
    aware of its instantaneous termination, as the constituent particles of their
    physical selves were torn apart and scattered into the void at velocities approaching
    the speed of light.\n\nIt was just as well for them.\n\nOf all the people touched
    by the event they had triggered, theirs was the most humane fate. For neither
    captain knew that the immense stock of isogen-5 which detonated before their eyes
    was entangled with numerous stockpiles in even greater quantities, assembled for
    a very specific purpose, and deliberately scattered throughout the New Eden cluster
    and beyond.\n\nNor could they know that the ancient race which had placed them
    there possessed not only a vision beyond the grasp of today's science, but also
    the technological advancement necessary to realize its potential.\n\nBut all tools,
    no matter how simple or complex, possess a duality of purpose. Fire can provide
    life-giving warmth, or can burn the flesh from the bone.\n\n<div align=\"center\"
    style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\n\"I'm sure this was covered during orientation,\"
    Dr. Garcia stated, loud enough to draw the attention of other staff in the cramped
    facility. \"But Cassandra would tell you if there was a problem.\"\n\nThe young
    technician squirmed in his chair. As the newest member of the team, he would have
    preferred to not be the one to announce that the most advanced solar monitoring
    system of the Federation had just inexplicably gone offline.\n\nYet the protocol
    for managing this kind of situation was unwritten, and so pressing the equivalent
    of a \"panic button\" seemed a reasonable course of action. Now every senior researcher
    in the facility was standing shoulder to shoulder in the weather operations center,
    waiting impatiently for an explanation they didn't expect to be worth their time.\n\nThe
    watch officer muttered a curse. \"SCOPE just picked up on it,\" he growled, shaking
    his head. \"Must be a slow news day. Goddamn eavesdroppers.\"\n\nDr. Garcia's
    glare was burning holes into the new recruit. Everyone in the room figured he'd
    be bounced back to University within the hour.\n\n\"Show us what you have.\"\n\nThe
    tech briefly explained his actions before resorting to the playback. The telemetry
    had to be slowed down to frames just fractions of a millisecond in length so everyone
    could see it.\n\nEvery sensor in Cassandra's advanced suite of solar monitoring
    gear had spiked to impossible levels: subspace, gravimetric, electromagnetic,
    and more, detected from the high polar orbit of the satellite's pass over the
    Type-O star half an AU from where they were standing. The source of this frantic
    energy release was a powerful explosion, roughly triangulated to a source location
    between the planet and the sun itself.\n\nCassandra's last report was that the
    potent magnetic field of the star had drastically realigned itself towards that
    explosion.\n\nDr. Garcia blinked. \"Impossible,\" she mumbled. \"Stars can't do
    that...\"\n\nAs if remembering something urgent, she glanced at her watch. \"How
    long ago did this happen?\"\n\nThe technician checked his instruments before answering.\n\n\"About
    three minutes ago.\"\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nIt
    seemed like an unlikely place to build a thriving metropolis.\n\nDevoid of any
    atmosphere, Seyllin I was a hellish world whose daytime surface temperature soared
    high enough to turn lead into molten slag. Though deep within Federation space,
    the world and system may as well been an unremarkable fringe territory hardly
    worth the fuel needed to reach it. Sixty years ago, an independent surveyor named
    Braggs Seyllin left an executive position with Material Acquisition to prospect
    on his own. Smitten with the endless optimism of a true pioneer, he vowed to build
    a mining empire that would rival the corporation which launched his career.\n\nAfter
    numerous years and hardships which depleted the entirety of his fortune, Braggs
    Seyllin finally struck gold\u2014literally\u2014with TLXX-01, the Federation catalog
    name of the system which would later bear his name. Deep beneath the surface of
    that cratered wasteland was a treasure trove of natural resources, including an
    abundance of heavier metals coveted in virtually every manufacturing sector of
    the cluster.\n\nUndaunted by the steep logistical challenge of harvesting this
    bounty, Seyllin raised the capital he needed from governments, corporations, and
    private investors to build his vision of what a mining operation should be: a
    frontier settlement, run by people operating equipment rather than drones doing
    all the work on man's behalf. If it were any other world or man, investors would
    have never accepted the idea. But the abundance of subterranean treasure on TLXX-01
    made the effort worthwhile\u2014and Braggs Seyllin was able to deliver not just
    on his promise to investors, but to the millions of prospectors eventually lured
    by the opportunity to work and prosper.\n\nLeave it to Federation terraforming
    expertise to create a living, breathing world beneath the surface of an inhospitable
    planet. In the mined excavation sites where thick veins of precious ore once lay,
    intersecting caverns big enough to house capital ships were now illuminated in
    gentle cycles with artificial sunlight; water ran in streams and falls throughout
    a cityscape that was equal parts lush vegetation and stylish living quarters;
    atmosphere scrubbers worked with the ecosystem to recycle air and push a comfortable
    breeze throughout the miles of interconnecting city blocks and work centers.\n\nThe
    ambitious subterranean project did as much for the science of transforming worlds
    as it proved that the mining industry was core to the identity of the nation.
    In all, four main cities would be constructed: Loadcore, Metal City, Southern
    Cross, and Valimor. Braggs Seyllin died before the last of these could be completed,
    but his legacy was already established. At the time of his passing twenty years
    ago, 8 million people lived on TLXX-01. By the time the planet was rechristened
    Seyllin I, more than a half billion called those underground caverns home. These
    were thriving, pulsing cityscapes interconnected by magrail systems that spanned
    around the entire planet. Peak production for most of its natural resources was
    fast approaching, but the economic and cultural significance of Seyllin to the
    Gallente Federation would last long after the last chunk of ore was recovered.\n\nUntil
    now, this had been the expectation.\n\nAccess points for each of the main cities
    littered the surface of Seyllin I. The most common of these were spaceports, which
    allowed dropships to transfer passengers and cargo within the safety of shielded
    containment fields. The planet hosted several space elevators for heavy freight,
    but these could only be operated at night due to the extreme daytime temperatures.
    Just beneath these access points was a network of operational support structures,
    all filled with people like the researchers in the Cassandra monitoring site,
    elevator freight cargo masters, dropship mechanics, and thousands of others.\n\nOn
    the daytime side of Seyllin I, these individuals witnessed a bright flash, then
    had perhaps a fraction of a second to notice an alarming rise in temperature and
    hear the sizzling sound of air molecules blown apart by subatomic particles. Those
    inside surface observatories, such as Dr. Garcia and her colleagues, caught fire
    immediately and lived just long enough to realize it before their hearts stopped
    beating.\n\nThose at deeper depths were more shielded and thus wouldn't immediately
    feel their bodies being penetrated and ruined by the invisible onslaught. Instead,
    a curtain of dread would fall over them as the electronic systems supporting their
    lives\u2014including those which provided access to the surface both here and
    on the night side of the planet\u2014suddenly ceased.\n\nTheirs would be the irony
    of being trapped in the dark, when somewhere above them the hottest sun in the
    cosmos was hurling radioactive fire upon them.\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\n\"This
    is no ordinary flare,\" the CONCORD representative stated. \"That much material
    bring thrown off is characteristic of a supernova, only there isn't enough of
    it to suggest that a total collapse is imminent. But the ejected plasma is following
    this new magnetic field at incredible sublight speeds.\"\n\n\"So what you're saying
    is that we're going to lose Seyllin\u2026*completely*.\"\n\n\"As it exists today?
    Yes.\"\n\nThe President clasped a hand over his chin, rubbing absently.\n\n\"How
    much time before\u2026\"\n\n\"Less than five hours. *If* everything else remains
    the same.\"\n\nSouro Foiritan stared ahead towards someplace far from where he
    was. His eyes were glassy; there may have been just half a drop quivering atop
    a tear duct. A few moments passed before he spoke again.\n\nHis voice, though,
    was strong.\n\n\"We keep this between us. Not one word about what's going to happen,
    not even to rescue crews. We'll call them back in as soon as you nail down zero
    hour. We can\u2026save more people this way.\"\n\n\"If that's your decision, we
    respect it. But as you know, SCOPE is a technically proficient organization which
    is quite adept at\u2014\"\n\n\"Take whatever discretions you need,\" Foiritan
    growled, looking towards Mentas Blaque and holding his stare for a moment. The
    Black Eagles commander gave an imperceptible nod before leaving the room without
    saying a word.\n\n\"We'll do what we can from our end to keep them quiet,\" the
    president said.\n\nHe paused again.\n\n\"If you were down there, would you want
    to know the end of the world was coming?\"\n\nThe image flickered, and shadows
    flashed each of the men standing in the room. The CONCORD official never changed
    his expression.\n\n\"Mr. President, if I was on Seyllin right now, I would think
    it had ended already.\"\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nThe
    dropship pilot pushed the throttle all the forward. The cockpit began to rattle
    as the instrument panel erupted with red warnings.\n\n\"We're too heavy!\" the
    loadmaster shouted through the intercom. \"We gotta shed weight\u2014\"\n\n\"*Strap
    yourself in and shut up*,\" the pilot snapped, willing his craft upwards. He could
    feel the seat beneath him tremble as the craft's twin engines spewed white-hot
    plasma against the spaceport landing pad. \"She's got more than this, I know it...\"\n\nThree
    hundred survivors were crammed into the back, nearly half a ton heavier than the
    maximum weight that the Federation Pegasus-class dropship could handle for a planet
    with Seyllin's mass. The military variant was equipped with enough thrust to put
    less than half as many troops in full combat gear into a hot zone with 1.0 G conditions.
    Now it was carrying a hold full of screaming victims from the pulse event at Seyllin,
    plus all the life support systems needed to keep them alive. Most of the victims
    had horrific burns, some with their clothing fused directly into the skin. This
    batch had been transported by one of the few magrails still functioning on the
    daylight side of the planet and pushed to the front of the evac queue. All of
    them were violently sick, having been exposed to deadly levels of radiation ejected
    from the system's blue sun.\n\nThe pilot could see dozens of dropships orbiting
    the installation near this spaceport; his instruments were tracking even more
    than he couldn't see. Local tower control was completely overwhelmed\u2014most
    of the pilots were either relying on broadcast telemetry from carriers overhead,
    or on their own skill and vision to avoid collisions. All of them were jockeying
    position to land, take on survivors, and get off as quickly as possible. And though
    he hadn't seen it himself, he heard that the daytime side of Seyllin I was unapproachable,
    limiting the number of sites where evacuations could happen at all.\n\nAudio warnings
    foretold of engine failure as the Pegasus strained just a meter over the pad.
    His loadmaster was shouting a litany of panicked obscenities that in different
    circumstances might have sounded comical.\n\nKeeping one eye on an external camera
    display, he reached up and flipped two switches on a console; the mounted gun
    pods on the dropship's nose and wingtips were jettisoned and fell to tarmac. The
    craft begin climbing quickly as his instruments confirmed that the craft still
    maintained structural integrity and would survive an ascent into space.\n\nHe
    was barely clear of the spaceport when another dropship nestled into the pad,
    staying clear of the discarded bubble turrets. Even though it was night, the surface
    of the sprawling spaceport was shimmering in heat. From the IR vision in his helmet
    visor, it looked like the surface of hell.\n\nThe Pegasus accelerated upwards.
    And as soon its hold was cleared, it was going to return for more survivors.\n\n<div
    align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\n\"Every affected system
    had a Type-O star,\" the scientist stated. \"And it appears that every single
    one of them had an identical event.\"\n\nPresident Foiritan was beside himself.
    \"*\u2018Identical'*? Where else is the loss of life so high\u2014\"\n\n\"Seyllin
    was the only world with a notable population,\" the advisor muttered. \"Blue-star
    systems tend to be devoid of surface life, it's just too\u2014\"\n\n\"*Get to
    the point!*\"\n\nThe scientist blushed. \"The point is\u2026it's not over yet.
    This main sequence anomaly was just the beginning, but it\u2026.was set into motion
    by something else, something connected to those subspace bursts. It triggered
    a chain reaction that we're struggling to understand\u2026it's as if the fabric
    of time and space itself has been wrenched from beneath us.\"\n\nThe scientist's
    hands were trembling, but he had earned the attention of everyone in the room.\n\n\"Alright,\"
    the president said, calmly. \"Spell it out for us, but quickly.\"\n\nIn a futile
    attempt to calm himself, the scientist inhaled deeply before starting.\n\n\"Three
    other systems besides Seyllin reported multi-frequency burst activity just prior
    to the solar event. All of it was high-energy, electromagnetic radiation, the
    kind of energy released in massive stellar events, but\u2026each location is spread
    across the cluster, and\u2026there are probably more locations than we know about
    now\u2026\"\n\nProminent beads of sweat had formed below the memory implants in
    the scientist's brow as the weight of the Federation's highest authorities bore
    down on him.\n\n\"Go on\u2026\" the president said.\n\n\"We've detected multiple
    instances of point-defect turbulence in systems unaffected by these main sequence
    anomalies.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" Foiritan interrupted. \"'What's a point-defect\u2014\"\n\n\"Wormholes,\"
    the scientist said. \"The first naturally occurring wormholes since the collapse
    of the EVE gate.\"\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\n\"No
    matter how hard I try,\" Empress Jamyl said softly, her clothes drenched with
    perspiration. \"Death follows me everywhere I go.\"\n\nCaretaker drones gently
    helped her sit upright in the bed of her chambers. Servants no longer looked after
    her when she confronted her demons. Lord Victor ended the practice not for concern
    of their safety, but to keep her private affairs as far from the public eye as
    possible.\n\n\"We won't know the full extent of the damage for some time,\" he
    said, taking a flask of water from the drone and handing it to her. \"You're sure
    the Sansha weren't a target of your adversary?\"\n\n\"No more than Seyllin, or
    the Great Wildlands, or anywhere else this catastrophe has stricken,\" she said,
    accepting the water and downing it. \"Yet even this is nothing compared with what
    is to come.\"\n\nVictor raised an eyebrow. The Sansha were always a prime surveillance
    and acquisition interest for Imperial intelligence. Their advances in cybernetic
    technology provided the live realization for the kinds of medical experiments
    that Amarrian scientists could only dream of. The Sansha have long known that
    they were being watched, and that errant ships had been captured and dissected
    by Victor's own men from time to time. He wondered if the Empire would be blamed
    for the destruction of one of their worlds.\n\n\"They won't,\" Jamyl answered,
    hearing Victor's thoughts as if they were her own. \"They don't mourn their dead
    the way we do. And besides\u2026\"\n\nA drone extended an arm to help her stand.
    It was a strange sight, seeing a woman this physically strong rely on a machine
    just to stand on her feet. \"\u2026they'll be looking in the same direction as
    us for answers: far, far away from New Eden.\"\n\nLord Victor watched as she moved
    away from the drone on her own power, one burdened step at a time.\n\n\"I'm getting
    closer to understanding this,\" she said. \"I wish Marcus could see what the empyreans
    are about to discover. His work would be vindicated.\"\n\n\"My lady, I don't understand\u2026\"\n\n\"You
    don't need to,\" she said, waving him away. \"Just thank your God that Amarr was
    spared from this.\"\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\n\"You
    must do *exactly* as I say,\" the SCOPE editor breathed, looking hurriedly over
    his shoulder. \"Take this and publish it as-is. Don't wait for confirmation from
    the others, just do it.\"\n\nThe press intern sounded unsure of himself. \"Umm,
    sure. Where, though\u2014\"\n\n\"*Listen to me*,\" the editor snapped, loud enough
    to draw the attention of several fans as he pushed his way through the crowd.
    The station promenade was packed for the regional skyball playoffs, but the mood
    was more subdued than usual as word of the crisis unfolding in Seyllin spread.\n\nThe
    editor was under no delusions that he could escape his pursuers by coming here.
    He hoped only to slow them down, and that this intern could do what he asked before
    they got to him as well.\n\n\"Push this report directly into the international
    feeds. Bump everything else off the queue, this takes flash priority. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Flash
    priority? Sheesh, I don't have the clout to do that\u2014\"\n\nAn unruly fan bumped
    shoulders with the editor, spinning him halfway around. His heart stopped beating
    for a moment.\n\n\"You've been authenticated to send flash\u2026\"\n\nHe could
    see them: three men, in black coats. The crowd was separating for them.\n\n\"Millions
    of people are counting on this. Send that broadcast before it's too late for them\u2026.\"\n\n\"Okay,
    umm, I'm in the system, and the flash with your ID is queued. Confirm it?\"\n\n\"*Ye\u2014!*\"\n\nThankfully,
    the explosion of pain in his lower back was short lived, as the motor functions
    in everything from his neck down simply froze. He saw himself collapse awkwardly\u2014the
    impact probably did physical damage, but he felt nothing. The attack had come
    from behind; *probably a z-stick*, he thought, watching the Black Eagles reach
    out to confiscate his earpiece and datapad.\n\nHe could tell they weren't being
    gentle with his incapacitated carcass as they dragged him back through the promenade.
    They would fabricate a charge against him, but couldn't hold him for long. Blaque
    and his cronies would face a barrage of protests and legal threats for imprisoning
    SCOPE reporters, and they were fully aware of it.\n\nWhich means the ends must
    justify the means.\n\n*There is no question that Seyllin is doomed. And people
    have a right to know that.*\n\nThe editor hoped the message was delivered to the
    world like he asked, and wondered why doing the right thing was always so difficult.\n\n<div
    align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\n\"We don't know where
    they lead,\" the scientist continued. \"Or, what we'll find once we're there.\"\n\nFor
    the first time since the crisis began, President Foiritan began to face the cruel
    possibility that what was unfolding could somehow be larger than what had happened
    at Seyllin.\n\n\"Warships can enter our sovereign space from them?\"\n\n\"Yes.
    And though we can't predict where they'll appear, we can say with reasonable confidence
    that their stability will be affected by the mass that passes through them.\"\n\n\"Capital
    ships?\"\n\n\"Possibly. But not an entire fleet.\"\n\n\"Not an entire fleet,\"
    the president repeated, pacing back and forth. \"But, say, a pack of cloaked Marauders,
    using a direct portal between Luminaire and New Caldari\u2014\"\n\n\"Or between
    Luminaire and a system that's not even in this cluster.\"\n\nPresident Foiritan
    straightened his posture. His face was gaunt, but he kept his demeanor rigid.\n\n\"Admiral
    Ranchel, how agile is your fleet deployment along the Border Zone?\"\n\nThe voice,
    carried by speakers in the office walls, was loud enough to be heard in the hallway
    outside. \"The strength of our defenses won't be compromised so long as the frequency
    of wormhole appearances is consistent. As far as location goes, if we can scan
    it, we can kill it. But we would never pursue a retreating force, not without
    assurances of where our assets will wind up.\"\n\n\"Very well. How many have we
    rescued from Seyllin?\"\n\n\"Just over half a million.\"\n\nEveryone in the room
    saw the color leave Souro's face.\n\n\"The limited number of landing sites makes
    it difficult,\" Admiral Ranchel added, his voice subdued. \"Given the amount of
    time remaining, we might be able to double that figure. But not much more than
    that.\"\n\nNo one said a word. The president stood, surrounded by his closest
    advisors, completely helpless to do anything more.\n\n\"Keep doing the best you
    can,\" he said. \"Have you\u2014\"\n\nThe Chief of the Federation Intelligence
    Office spoke abruptly.\n\n\"Mr. President,\" she gasped. \"Mentas was too late.\"\n\n<div
    align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\n\"Wave off and turn
    back! Wave off or you're a dead man!\"\n\nFor the third time, the Pegasus was
    hovering just meters over the landing pad. Its pilot could see people rushing
    the gantries, trying to get into the spaceport's boarding area.\n\n\"We're out
    of time!\" his carrier dispatch screamed.\n\nHis mind wandered as the craft hung
    in the balance between life and death. Someone in that throng of people had surely
    given up his place to let a wounded man onto the last dropship that would ever
    touch down on Seyllin. Someone's act of kindness in the midst of a terrible nightmare
    would be his noble end.\n\nThat person was right there, so close to where he was.\n\n\"*For
    God's sake, you're going to get left behind!*\"\n\nWithout his conscious approval,
    his hand pulled back on the stick. The dropship was responsive, eager to fly to
    the carrier above, and then away from the approaching wall of fire that would
    bring about the end of the world. The hold was empty, save for a single loadmaster
    standing among rows of empty seats covered with the blood and gore of those whom
    fortune or kindness had spared. As though fleeing for its own life, the Pegasus
    turned its back on the damned souls of Seyllin and hurled away, its lone pilot's
    eyes moist with tears.\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nThe
    planet of Seyllin I perished, as did dozens of other worlds\u2014some in New Eden,
    and some that no person in recorded history would ever know about. The intentions
    of Antar and Kotan were irrelevant now, as the universe of their origin had changed
    so fundamentally that it would probably be unrecognizable to them. Neither man
    could have imagined that the consequences of their actions would be so widespread,
    or that evil could triumph so decidedly over the powers of good.\n\nThe civilizations
    of New Eden would mourn for those who were lost, and then search in earnest for
    the reason why they died. But they would not look amongst the burnt cinders of
