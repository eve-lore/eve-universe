    in, and while the station's atmospheric generators compensated for it to some
    small degree, the air was still kept cold and crisp. Wind machines kept currents
    running and made for buttoned-up coats, scarves and hats. People needed seasons,
    to mark the passage of time.\n\nThe young couple, Satyan and Treta, were walking
    hand in hand down the station's busiest shopping street, window-shopping for daydreams.
    Both of them had good jobs, he in health-goods marketing, spearheading the new
    transparent ad campaigns after the recent viral marketing fiasco, and she in accounting,
    where she specialized in passenger monitoring and toll calculations. Their wedding
    was still a few weeks away.\n\nThey stopped in front of a travel agency and looked
    at the ads, which were scrolling through on large flat screens set in the windows.
    Motion sensors registered their presence, and the scrollthrough automatically
    slowed. On one side of the screen was a narrow band that showed a spectrum of
    color from dark blue to dark red; the color represented the kind of excitement
    and adventure you wanted from your trip. Satyan waved a hand at the spectrum's
    red end, but Treta immediately waved hers a little further down.\n\n\"Killjoy,\"
    Satyan said.\n\n\"Nutcase,\" Treta replied, and kissed him.\n\n The screen began
    flipping through images of various trips, on both space stations and planets.
    \"The planetside ones are so expensive,\" Satyan said.\n\n\"And overblown, too,\"
    Treta said. \"Look at this one. A safari on Luminaire?\n\nSatyan glanced at it
    and smiled. \"Actually, I went on those quite a bit when I was younger. Which
    planet is it?\" He noticed Treta's expression. \"Uh, I mean, who wants to spend
    their honeymoon surrounded by wild animals?\"\n\nTreta coughed.\n\n\"Apart from
    each other, I mean,\" Satyan said.\n\nTreta grinned.\n\nSatyan continued, \"There's
    another one. It's ...\" He peered at it. \"Seriously? Stay in an old Amarrian
    palace for a week?\"\n\n\"My kind of life. Can we even afford this, though?\"
    Treta said.\n\n\"If we could, I wouldn't go anyway.\"\n\n\"So no partying and
    no frippery. Halfway between.\"\n\n\"Perfect,\" Satyan said and kissed her.\n\n\"I
    wonder what things will be like after that.\"\n\n\"Same as before,\" Satyan said.
    \"Only better.\"\n\nShe smiled, then looked at a nearby store window and pointed.
    \"Oh, look! They've got food mixers. This would be perfect for you when you're
    starting your day.\"\n\nSatyan grunted something in reply.\n\n\"Oh, come on,\"
    she said, dragging him over to the window. \"You've got no morning appetite and
    can't drink milk, and you know the doc said you have to eat breakfast. It's either
    this or gruel.\"\n\n\"Sweetie,\" Satyan said, \"these things are so loud they
    could wake the dead.\"\n\n\"That's nice, dear. Look, they sell all sorts of different
    things! Alarm chronometers, more mixers, equilateral bread slicers, EMP cookers,
    washing microbots, oh, self-cleaning coffee brewers, ion stoves, holoviewers,
    stasis-cooled cheese plates, electric pillows... and look, they even expect wooden
    furniture.\"\n\n\"That's hideously expensive.\"\n\n\"It's antique style, too,\"
    Treta said.\n\n\"So will we be if we buy it. The debts'll age me prematurely.\"\n\n\"Now
    now,\" she said. \"The-... what's that?\"\n\nSomething small and mechanical buzzed
    passed them, followed by a little human tornado that bumped into Treta on its
    way past. Satyan reached down and grabbed hold of the kid's shirt. \"Hey, hey,
    hey! Where you running to, little man?\"\n\nThe kid gave him a startled look,
    then smiled from ear to ear. \"That's my drone,\" he said and pointed at the mechanical
    thing. It was indeed a small toy drone, and was currently encircling a trashcan
    nearby.\n\n\"What's your name?\" Satyan said.\n\n\"Dappy.\"\n\n\"Well, Dappy,
    you should know it's not polite to run into people. What do we say if we do that?\"\n\n\"Sorry,\"
    Dappy said and grinned.\n\n\"Not to me, silly,\" Satyan said, but couldn't help
    grinning back. \"The lady here.\"\n\nDappy turned to her and said, \"Sorry, lady,\"
    still grinning.\n\nTreta nodded at him, then looked at Satyan and silently mouthed
    Lady?\n\n\"Can you help me?\" the kid said and pointed towards the drone, which
    was still flying around the trashcan. \"I set it too fast.\"\n\nTreta, aching
    a little from where the kid had bumped into her, whispered to Satyan, \"I never
    even saw him coming.\"\n\nSatyan whispered back, \"Well, he's here now, I suppose,\"
    and set about trying to catch the boy's toy drone. The machine eluded his first
    couple of tries, but he eventually got a hold of it, tuned its speed down and
    handed it back to the kid, saying, \"Here. And don't run so much. Relax. Enjoy
    life.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" the kid said, and immediately ran off.\n\nSatyan shook
    his head. From here he stood he happened to glance at a nearby window, one that
    Treta couldn't see yet, and noticed a store that was selling cell phones. Each
    'cell' was in fact a station, and phone prices were effectively determined by
    whether your phone would work only within the solar system, or could be used to
    contact people in other systems as well. Intra-system talk would have crisp, clear
    communication, but as soon as you left the solar system, all talk got laggy, distorted
    and muddled, not to mention far more expensive. Once you were out of the region,
    that was it; silence fell. Only the capsuleers had access to better technology.\n\n\"Might
    need something like that,\" Satyan said.\n\nTreta walked over to him, looked in
    the window, then shook her head. \"My turn now. It's too expensive.\"\n\n\"Come
    on. What if I get posted off-station?\"\n\n\"Then you can send me recordings.
    Or use the combooths like everyone else.\"\n\n\"Still-\"\n\nTreta turned on him.
    \"It's too damn expensive, Satyan. If we don't have enough money for the furniture
    and things, we don't have it for this, either.\"\n\n\"Hey, come on.\"\n\n\"No,
    you come on. I'm tired of you scuttling anything that I want to get, then not
    applying the same standards to yourself.\" She threw up her arms. \"But hey, what
    do I know? Maybe it'd be good to have a cell, so's I can keep an eye on you when
    you're away.\"\n\n\"Oh, right,\" Satyan said. \"Because I can't be trusted. I'd
    jump into bed with the next woman I saw.\"\n\n\"Well, what do I know? For all
    I know you could be doing it with Sari right now.\"\n\n\"Hah,\" Satyan said. \"Not
    in a million years.\"\n\n\"Hey! That's my best friend you're talking about.\"\n\nSatyan
    put his arms around Treta and kissed her on the forehead. \"I'm sorry, baby. I
    would definitely sleep with Sari if you weren't around. Feel better now?\"\n\nShe
    plonked him on the nose, then kissed it. \"Silly man.\" Then she broke free of
    his grip and walked on, oblivious of the future.\n\nSatyan remained, staring at
    the cell phones in the windows, not seeing them. Then he followed, grasped for
    Treta's hand and took firm hold of it, and they continued on.\n\n***\n\nThis time
    it was Treta's attention that was caught by something, across the street. She
    crossed it, and Satyan followed.\n\n\"Look,\" she said, pointing to a window.
    It was a baby clothing store. Satyan's eyes widened and he took an exaggerated
    step backwards, his hands in front of him like he were being held up at gunpoint.\n\nTreta
    laughed. \"Get over here,\" she said, and looked in the window. The display included
    everything from jumpsuits to shoes. The latter were at a discount, a sign said,
    because of a manufacturing error.\n\nSatyan, who felt uncomfortable even looking
    at the things, decided to at least take part in the conversation. \"Well, they're
    cheap.\"\n\n\"Mmm. I don't like them too much,\" Treta said. \"They might fall
    apart at least notice.\" She looked closer. \"It almost looks like they've been
    worn before.\"\n\n\"Sweetie, they're baby shoes, for sale,\" Satyan said, \"and
    were probably never worn.\"\n\nShe shivered, and moved on.\n\nAs Satyan followed,
    he noticed that the air had in fact gotten even colder. It would probably be time
    to head home soon. He found a street vendor nearby, selling food and hot drinks,
    and led Treta there. The greasy smell of fried fat didn't much raise their appetites,
    so they bought hot drinks instead; Satyan a warm soup, Treta a frothy brew. For
    no real reason, Satyan reached out with his free hand and put it around Treta's
    waist, hugging her tight. Treta returned the gesture. Behind them, the baby shoes
    stood still on the shelves, unmoved.\n\nAfter they were done, they tossed the
    plastic cups into the recycle bin next to the vendor's cart, and walked on. The
    next store was an insurance booth, and Satyan made a crack about having one right
    next to a fast food vendor.\n\nTreta thought it over while looking at the premiums
    they offered, then said, \"Well ... I'm not sure I want to say that something
    like this is too expensive. But still...\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Satyan said. \"I know
    what you mean.\" And they put it out of their minds, like a blackened match tossed
    into a dark corner.\n\nAfter they'd walked apace, Satyan added, \"Actually, the
    furniture might not be a bad idea.\"\n\nTreta stared at him. \"Are you serious?\"\n\n\"And
    some curtains.\" He saw her look. \"Well, why not? If we plan to make a home,
    why not make a home? I don't mind the idea of coming back home to a warm place,
    familiar smells, lights on and a fireplace on the screen. And you.\"\n\nShe grasped
    his hand a little harder.\n\n\"The world doesn't always have to spin around,\"
    he said.\n\n\"No, it doesn't. Nor we with it,\" she said.\n\nThey came to a park,
    and saw the wind blow through the trees. The leaves were falling off in droves,
    leaving the branches bare and alone. The trees stood there like sentinels; from
    the viewpoint of the leaves, and the seeds nesting in the ground, they'd undoubtedly
    always been there, and would always be.\n\nThey walked on until they came to another
    travel agency, and on unspoken agreement they both slowed the walk. Satyan idly
    waved his hand in front of the sensors, close to the low, blue end. Now, with
    the nippy winds of fall blowing down every crack and crevice, and the trees shorn
    of their leaves and seeds, a sedate, relaxed vacation on some warm planet didn't
    seem half so bad.\n\nThey looked at each other, turned and went into the park.
    Night was falling, and it was time to head home. Hand in hand, they walked down
    the final trails together. The leaves obscured their path until at last they were
    gone.\n"
