    found our kin, and found them strange.\"*\n\\- Rana Arnov. Memoirs\n\nTwo hundred
    golden, gleaming hulls, gathered on the fringes of the Vak\u2019Atioth system.
    Amarrian arrogance had mandated the use of such a small force. They did not expect
    resistance.\n\nFor the Amarrians, this was to be a great day. It would renew faith
    in the Reclaiming, a faith much needed. For weeks they had been advertising their
    intentions to crush the Jovians; flooding communications networks with propaganda
    proclaiming their people the chosen of God, rightful owners of the Jovian people.\n\nVak\u2019Atioth
    was not a primary system within the Jovian Empire. It lay upon the edge and contained
    only various small research facilities. It was, nonetheless, here that the mighty
    Amarr Empire had chosen to show the Jovians the undeniable might of their squadron,
    a force not even approaching the full size of the great Amarr Navy.\n\nThe Jovians
    valued one thing above all else \u2013 information. Their need for information
    had led to the formation of the Jovian intelligence network, an entity with eyes
    and ears in most Empires\u2019 internal archives. It delivered to the Jovians
    every plan the Amarrians had laid out for their assault \u2013 even before the
    Amarrian commanders themselves had received the information. This allowed the
    Jovians to plan extensively for the battle that would take place in one of their
    own systems \u2013 then called Vak\u2019Atioth, now known only as Atioth.\n\nIt
    was a rich and diverse mixture of battleships and cruisers, each ship equipped
    with state of the art Amarrian laser technology. Their ships were bulky and slow,
    but made up for their lack of agility with the devastating power of their laser
    batteries. The fleet organized itself in typical Amarrian military fashion - a
    staggered line designed to maximize the ghastly effect of tachyon fire against
    the enemy\u2019s front. Their hulls adorned with religious texts, broadcasting
    messages of Amarrian supremacy, interspersed with litanies and psalms in honour
    of the Reclaiming. This was their moment; this was what they lived for.\n\nThe
    first volley of fire erupted from an Apocalypse, its turrets taking aim and firing
    as one, blood-red beams slicing into the side of a stationary ship until the vessel\u2019s
    hull ruptured, pieces of it scattering like dust among the rank and file of the
    Jovian force.\n\nIt had begun.\n\nThe Jovian forces split into smaller wings,
    each numbering 5 ships, all equipped with devastating Jovian laser technology.
    Accelerating with frightening speed, they dove into the Amarrian attack forces.
    Amarrian cruisers equipped with close-range weaponry moved to intercept as wave
    after wave of the smaller vessels engaged single targets, like a furious pack
    of wolves, dodging and weaving, maximizing maneuverability.\n\nAnd then it happened.
    Massive, eerily green blasts erupted from seemingly nowhere, and an Amarrian Apocalypse
    went up in flames. Another blast erupted what seemed mere seconds later, and tore
    through a squad of Mallers, their hulls briefly flickering with bright green energy
    discharges.\n\nThe Amarrians did not expect this. Their rigid command structure
    inhibiting communications, they did not realize what was happening. Lack of coherence
    and interoperability in the fleet meant that they could not cope with the sudden
    appearance of this unseen terror.\n\nIt was a Jovian Mother ship.\n\nSwooping
    in, the Jove frigate forces caused even more confusion, sending the Amarrian forces
    into disarray. At this point, communications broke down. Amarrian battle doctrine
    demanded sacrifice, and so the Navy could not disengage. Captains and their crews
    valiantly threw down their lives for the Empire, confident that they, God\u2019s
    chosen, would be victorious. The few that retreated would later be executed for
    cowardice, their families enslaved and their Houses disbanded.\n\nFor hours streams
    of glaring light lit up the system that night, the nimble Jove frigates diving
    into the Amarr fleet, their ranged cruisers supporting them with laser-fire over
    a distance and the titanic Mothership firing blast after blast of its extreme-range
    weapons; cannons created specifically for this battle. The smaller vessels holding
    the Jovian line prevented Amarrian squads from coming close enough to fire upon
    their nemesis, leaving the fleet defenseless against its onslaught.\n\nBattleship
    after battleship exploded in a violent bursts of light under the attack from the
    Jovian mother ship. This left the Amarrians in a position they had not been in
    before \u2013 What could they do but press on and die?\n\nNot six hours later
    Vak\u2019Atioth was overflowing with the remnants of hulls drifting into the emptiness
    of space. The Jovians had won the first battle of this war; the majority of the
    Amarrian fleet had been demolished whilst only a third of the Jovians ships had
    been lost. The Amarr knew they had to respond quickly and in numbers. Publicly,
    they blamed impetuous leadership for the headlong assault on the Jovians \u2013
    even if that was exactly what Amarrian battle doctrine had dictated. So it was
    that captains that had given their lives for their Empire without a single thought
    of retreat were posthumously discharged from the Navy, their reputations ruined
    and their families disgraced.\n\nA much larger fleet was ordered to gather in
    preparation for another assault upon the Jovians. They never got the opportunity
    to react.\n\nThe Matari chose this moment to rebel against their Amarrian masters.
    Uncannily well equipped for slaves and high on morale, they proved more than a
    match for their demoralized Amarrian captors. Faced with losing their grip on
    the Minmatar, the Amarrians had no choice but to redirect their entire military
    force to the home front to handle the rebelling slaves. To this day, rumours circulate
    that the Gallentean Federation secretly outfitted the rebels with weapons, ships
    and supplies.\n\nAnd thus, a quick and hasty peace was agreed upon with the Jovians;
    if only to allow the Amarrians to concentrate on themselves. The Amarrians agreed
    not to attack the Jovians again. Both sides knew this was not sincere. However,
    the Jovians were happy to settle and continue as they were. To them, the complexities
    of the barbaric Amarrian nature were of interest only in the academic sense. Their
    handling of the Amarrian fleet blessed them with the reputation of an entity not
    to be tangled with.\n\nNo-one has attacked the Jovians since."
