    Fedo is a fairly small (ca. 30-50 cm long, 20-40 cm high) animal originating in
    underground caves on the planet Palpis. The planet was settled by the Amarrians
    long ago, and the Fedo has spread with Amarr vessels throughout the galaxy cluster
    ever since.\n\nThe Fedo is an omnivorous, sponge-like creature. It has reddish
    skin and numerous small claw-like tentacles which it uses to move around and protect
    itself.  A primitive being, the Fedo's method of eating and absorbing nutrition
    is slow and inefficient. This means that food stays for a long time in the Fedo\u2019s
    body, and will most often have rotted or turned foul before the animal passes
    it out of its system. The Fedos eject fumes from their body which, for the reasons
    explained above, have a most horrible odor. The Fedos possess a fantastic sense
    of smell and so use these fumes to communicate with each other; they are however
    both blind and deaf, having no eyes or ears. The mouth is located on the underside
    of the beast, and the Fedo feeds by positioning itself over the food and lowering
    itself down on it.\n\nFedos are an incredibly strong and resilient species. They
    can live in total vacuum for several hours before succumbing to the cold and lack
    of oxygen. Some Matari have used this fact to their advantage, employing Fedos
    on many of their ships for cleaning and garbage disposal. The Fedos are especially
    useful in that they can clean the ship on the outside as well as the inside; they
    can get to hard-to-reach areas on the ship and, most importantly, will exterminate
    many of the pesky bacteria commonly found on space ships. The Matari feed the
    Fedos with every scrap of waste produced on the ship, letting the beasts roam
    free around the vessel and even outside it. This saves money, but the downside
    is the foul stench produced by the Fedos, something which discourages most everybody
    from using them.\n\nThere is a distinct difference between male and female Fedos.
    The female is slightly larger and has redder skin. It has a point-like tail or
    sting, approx. 10 cm long. The female Fedo can emit highly toxic fumes from a
    small opening at the end of the tail, which can cause intense skin irritation
    and discomfort for a human. For this reason, only male Fedos are used as ship
    cleaners. Most ships employing Fedos have a special nursery room where female
    Fedos are kept to replenish the on-board Fedo stock. This is necessary as the
    Fedo's life cycle is only a few weeks long.\n"
