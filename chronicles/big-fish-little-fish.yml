    upper lip was sweating again.\n\nThroughout the academy years, through his stint
    with the Legion, through every shady encounter and back-handed double-deal, Monk
    Dubois had been haunted by the vagaries of his nervous system. He could wrest
    all the conviction in the world out of his voice, jump into whatever role was
    required with chameleon-like aplomb, talk his way into the record books and hatch
    plots with a winner\u2019s smile, but always his body screamed chemical murder,
    tendrils of bridled conscience playing havoc with his processes. Many a time had
    a rogue twitch or a freak stutter come perilously close to destroying a sweet
    deal, and more than once they\u2019d sent him scrambling for his life. Fate had
    seen him through so far, though, and as long as he had fate on his side, he figured,
    this damnably honest body of his wouldn\u2019t get the best of him yet.\n\nWiping
    the sheen off his lip, he waited patiently for the lift to reach Hangar Ingress
    3C wherein, suspended in this battered station complex in the middle of nowhere,
    waited the love of his life, her capacitor humming. Bad Ike\u2019s Rumour \u2013
    the fastest frigate in this backwater region and then some. He\u2019d held on
    to her longer than any other ship, and with a little help from old fate they\u2019d
    seen each other through a lot of tough spots.\n\nChiming its arrival, the lift
    opened into the ingress. As he got his first glimpse of the corridor beyond, a
    twinge of fear-laced anticipation took hold of Monk\u2019s gut. Suppressing thoughts
    of the enormity of what he was about to do, and the hatred it would inspire in
    the people he was about to do it to, he steeled himself and marched into the hallway.
    An Intaki maintenance tech passed him on his way to the Rumour, shuffling along
    in brooding silence. As they met there was brief and swiftly-averted eye contact,
    and in the instant it happened Monk felt sure the young man could see right into
    him.\n\nMaintaining his stride and steadying his breath, he kept walking. Coming
    to the end of the corridor a few steps later, he keyed in his sequence for Hangar
    Bay 3C and was admitted to the vast cylindrical space where his ship lay, suspended
    and motionless. Approaching the bay\u2019s main control panel, he stopped for
    a moment and wondered how much longer he was going to keep doing this. All those
    assumed names, all those forged identities, donned and discarded like so many
    theatre rags, and it all came down to this. After months of planning, of worming
    his way inside, playing his role to perfection, he now had only to press a few
    buttons, and in one fell swoop turn himself yet again into the vilest of all things
    vile.\n\nEvery time, Monk had relished this exact moment, this one second where
    acid-tinged self-loathing mixed with intoxicating joy as he watched the number
    rise with giddying alacrity, saw his personal account swell with his former compatriots\u2019
    hard-gotten gains.\n\nA sound from the ingress corridor brought him out of his
    reverie. Striding over to the doorway and leaning in, he saw the unmistakable
    silhouette of the small Intaki in the jumpsuit heading back towards the hangar
    bay.\n\nTime to work fast, he thought to himself as he ran back to the control
    panel. Seconds later, the dizzying rush of figures, the pistonic whirr of immense
    wealth, indicated that his corporation\u2019s accounts were dry. Now, all he had
    to do was get out of here and he was home free. Discard the fake credentials,
    hack his registration, chuck the fixer his cut, then spend the next year or two
    on some paradise world or other before doing it all over again.\n\nHe was halfway
    up the stairs to the capsule landing, musing on the ridiculous ease of the whole
    thing, when he heard the sound of steps on the main platform below him. Casting
    a glance over his shoulder, he saw the tech enter the room and, without a moment\u2019s
    hesitation, stride over to the bay panel and key in a sequence, lightning-fast.\n\nWith
    a low hum, Monk\u2019s pod began to detach from the landing. The bay\u2019s bright
    lights dimmed to a metallic dusk. Monk could feel the leaden silence descend on
    him as the near-subsonic warble of the station-wide intercom died abruptly.\n\nHe
    turned on the stairs, ready to put up his most indignant mask for the tech, now
    a shadowed figure on the platform. Just as he realized, somewhat sheepishly, that
    the small Intaki couldn\u2019t see his face, he heard the voice:\n\n\u201CMuch
    better. A far more peaceful environment to work in.\u201D\n\nThe last word had
    scarcely fallen when Monk heard a low clap and felt his knees buckle like jelly.
    As he tumbled down the stairs onto the platform, the crazed thought came to him
    that finally, fate had decided to tip the scales out of his favor.\n\nHe landed
    in a crumpled heap on the platform, one leg twisted unnaturally beneath him. The
    tech was already by the main control panel, fingers working with an almost supernaturally
    assured swiftness.\n\n\u201CWha\u2014who\u2026\u201D began Monk.\n\n\u201CQuiet,\u201D
    said the Intaki matter-of-factly, finishing up his keystroke sequence. He took
    the parapistol from his jumpsuit pocket and turned to face Monk again. Setting
    down on one knee, gun cocked inches from the terrified man\u2019s face, he began
    to speak in calm, measured tones.\n\n\u201CMr. Dubois, your funds have been wired
    through an easily traceable route to a corporation with competing interests to
    your own. When discovered here, you will confess to being an agent of theirs,
    working to undermine your current associates\u2019 position on your real employer\u2019s
    behalf.\u201D The easy command of his tone somehow managed to convey unspoken
    threats that sent Monk\u2019s gut whirling.\n\n\u201CEvents should unfold within
    the next two days that will give you ample opportunity to escape the associates
    you so callously betrayed \u2013 after, of course, they have meted out whatever
    punishment they see fit.\u201D A hint of a smile played at his thin lips.\n\n\u201CWhy?
    Why do this?\u201D asked Monk, bewildered, after a few seconds had passed in silence.\n\n\u201CConsider
    it your price, Mr. Dubois \u2013 your karmic price, if you will. And be grateful
    that you\u2019re playing a role, however inconsequential, in something that goes
    beyond yourself. A month from now, should you still be alive, you\u2019ll be able
    to look back and see the little mark you\u2019ve made on history. All told, I\u2019d
    say I\u2019m doing you a favor. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree that\u2019s more
    than any corp thief deserves.\u201D\n\nAs he had spoken the words the small man
    had stood up, pocketed his pistol once more, and, with another rapid-fire keystroke
    sequence, set the hangar bay to its regular configuration.\n\nAs he passed wordlessly
    through the doorway back to the ingress, Monk caught sight of his name tag: N
    LEUTRE.\n\nA screaming express of neural connections blazed its way to the forefront
    of his consciousness, memories of legendary tales told through whispered voices
    in smokey smuggler dives congealing in his mind.\n\nNiques Leutre. Aeron Assis.
    The Broker.\n\nCold sweat didn\u2019t begin to describe it.\n"
