    the years, the Caldari State\u2019s reigning ideology has been broadly defined
    by its emphasis on hard work, sacrifice, and the welfare of the collective over
    the welfare of the individual. Central to the Caldari mindset is the assumption
    that people work better when motivated by a feeling of contribution to a greater
    good, but even more important is the idea that people naturally gravitate toward
    the sphere of craft they are best suited for, as well as the position they should
    occupy within it. How has this philosophy been shaped over the tumultuous lifetime
    of the Caldari nation, though, and where does it stand today?\n\nIn the early
    days of Caldari-Gallente relations, when the two nations had just come into contact
    with each other, the somewhat unusual structure of Caldari government was explicitly
    set up so that no one person could wrest power from the council. The notion of
    individuality, so prized by the Gallente, tended to be viewed by the Caldari as
    little more than selfish blindness to the grander scheme of things, and was frowned
    upon by the vast majority of their leaders as well as the industrious masses that
    made up the civilian populace. After the first Gallente-Caldari war, the Chief
    Executive Panel \u2013 the corporate heads making up the Caldari State\u2019s
    ruling body \u2013 went even further with this ideology, soon enough taking their
    seat as polar opposites to their hated nemeses. While it may seem tempting to
    ascribe this to the ideological rubberbanding sometimes experienced by newly independent
    states, there is a great deal of historical data that suggests that even as far
    back as the time of the Raata-Oryioni empire thousands of years ago, the people
    who would later become the Caldari were already highly collectivistic in outlook
    and action.\n\nFor the newly-at-peace Caldari State, however \u2013 a nation bruised
    and bleeding from a lengthy war \u2013 things took on a different tenor. In the
    sudden absence of a unifying enemy, the people who at that time made up the Chief
    Executive Panel found themselves gradually turning their attentions to each other.
    Internal competition between the eight ruling corporations increased. Suggested
    initiatives and reforms usually served to somehow pad the coffers of the corporation
    that came up with them, ideally at the expense of their most direct competitors.
    While competence and devotion to the State were still held in overt esteem to
    as great a degree as ever \u2013 and, indeed, used as religiously in the nation\u2019s
    propaganda as they are today \u2013 the foundations these values were built on
    had begun to subtly slide.\n\nAs time passed, the entrenchment of those in power,
    as well as their fierce devotion to their internal competition, began to have
    trickle-down effects on the Big Eight\u2019s top tiers. Believing their own modes
    of governance and management preferable to whatever successors the Board of Directors
    would offer up, the CEOs of the megacorporations began to pull the strings behind
    the scenes, making sure their own prot\xE9g\xE9s ascended to positions where they
    would take over the reins when the time came. They also made sure that key positions
    within the corporate hierarchies were occupied by people whose goals and opinions
    coincided with their own. Thus, slowly but surely, covert dynasties began to snake
    their tendrils around the Caldari State\u2019s power structures.\n\nBy the time
    the capsuleers started making waves on the world scene, the State\u2019s hierarchies
    were crowded with individuals who had come by their positions through the mendacious
    maneuverings of well-placed superiors, and this played a significant role in the
    sharp economic downturn faced by the Caldari State. Each of New Eden\u2019s four
    major nations had suffered some form of economic setback in the wake of the ultra-rich
    capsuleer class\u2019s meteoric rise, but the Caldari, due to their set-in-stone
    mentality and reluctance to adapt, were perhaps the hardest hit. Unemployment
    skyrocketed. Goods and services rose in price. Imports and exports declined.\n\nSensing
    the shift in worldwide power, the Chief Executive Panel responded by coocooning
    themselves from the outside world and taking up isolationist policies. Diplomatic
    relations, never a strong part of the Caldari political skillset, became almost
    nonexistent. Even in the wake of such disasters as the Protein Delicacy incident
    (where Caldari-manufactured luncheonette foods were found to cause mental deficiencies
    in Gallente schoolchildren) or the Insorum incident (where a chemical compound
    capable of reversing the effects of one of Amarr\u2019s most relied-upon slave
    drugs was leaked from a Caldari biolab), the State\u2019s diplomats did little
    to placate those aggrieved by their mistakes. The Caldari nation was as mighty
    as ever, but it was hardening up from the inside out. It would take a major change
    to shake things up, and in YC 110 that change came in the form of a radical new
    leader, Tibus Heth.\n\nFinding nepotism-spawned inefficiency all over the State,
    Heth instigated several reforms intended to bring Caldari back to its roots as
    a meritocratic society. To this end, he employed his most trusted director, Janus
    Bravour, to set in motion a series of initiatives that would root out those undeserving
    of their positions and install in their stead people who had truly earned the
    right to be there. With the proper gears meshing in unison, the State would once
    again take its rightful role as a trampling juggernaut of commercial, industrial
    and military might.\n\nHeth\u2019s reforms reached into every sector of corporate
    activity. He began by confiscating the wealth of mid- to high-tier managers and
    executives all across the State and redistributing it among the lowest rungs of
    the workforce. He created programs that made sure people received adequate compensation
    for hard work, in the form of annual leave and early retirement. He greatly increased
    funding for education and re-education initiatives. He promoted worker summits
    wherein individual ingenuity was given an outlet. The main goal: to make sure
    that no matter which rung on the ladder a person occupies, they stand at least
    a fighting chance of making it to the rung above them \u2013 provided they truly
    deserve it.\n\nUnder the new system, social status is no obstacle to advancement.
    Within ten years\u2019 time, over half of the State\u2019s schools will be equipped
    with advanced screening methods for detecting unusual aptitude, so that those
    so gifted can be directed toward areas where their talent will do the most good.
    Institutions are being set up to give grants to armchair inventors and small business
    owners who never had the chance to take their ideas to a higher level. Government
    spies already are being disseminated among the ranks of the corporations and tasked
    with weeding out nepotism wherever they find it.\n\nIn the time since Heth took
    power a sizable number of citizens, believing the rule of a single man to contradict
    Caldari ideals, have left the country. The assumption among them has been that
    like the despots and dictators that litter history\u2019s pages he would surround
    himself with a power clique and leave the rest of the nation blowing in the wind,
    eroding the nutritious soil of cultural values that had kept the State strong
    throughout its existence. The nationalistic bent of his policies and his military
    ruthlessness have also caused a degree of alarm, prompting some citizens to question
    (quietly, of course) how their morality and their national identity fit together
    in these latest and darkest times.\n\nIn the span since Heth\u2019s inauguration,
    however, the turnaround in economic growth has been undeniable. Caldari have more
    money in their pockets. They are more secure about their retirement. People who
    under the old system would have found themselves forever excluded from certain
    positions now reside within those positions. The general feeling, on the streets
    and in the stations, is that for better or worse something great and grand is
    underway, that the previous system was ailing and outmoded, and that the New Meritocracy
    (as it has been dubbed by the press) is a return to form for a great nation shackled
    too long in the chains of favoritism. Averting their eyes from the darkness all
    around them, the Caldari people now for the first time in years set their sights
    on a brighter future."
