    who happened to be watching the exact point in space would only have seen a slight
    visual distortion against the stars. In the blink of an eye, the gravitational
    force of a star was generated over just a few short kilometers, compressing the
    fabric of space-time into a temporary singularity. The reverberation of that mass,
    when the remote graviton pulse wave that had tricked the physical laws of the
    universe subsided, produced a connection between two non-corresponding locations
    in the universe: a wormhole.\n\nThe event horizon immediately set off early warning
    sensors on the world below, basking in the radiance of its warm, yellow sun. Local
    forces were mobilized, but before they could act, the Sansha auto-replicating
    virus batch was already relayed and being broadcast from every major structure
    in the system \u2015 stargates, stations, and even planetary networks. The invasive
    programming quickly overwhelmed the inferior systems of the civilian infrastructure,
    local garrisons, and, though they would not admit it, most of the Gallente Federation\u2019s
    navy ships.\n\nThen the wormhole let out a searing burst of white light, and they
    came through, bulbous metallic vessels covered in wicked, uneven spines. Hundreds
    poured from the shimmering portal, covering light years of distance in a single
    instant to cloud the skies above the helpless planet. Almost fishlike, darting
    in loose formation and changing direction simultaneously, they spread out in all
    directions. With synchronized releases of focused electromagnetic blasts, they
    smoothly wiped all defensive structures and communications satellites from orbit.
    For many people on the surface, the sudden glare of golden laser beams lancing
    across the night sky was the first sign that Sansha\u2019s Nation had arrived.\n\nWhen
    it had secured the entire lower orbital altitude, the armada held position until
    a second wave of ships emerged from the wormhole. These new vessels were different,
    though, lacking the bulky warp drives that took up so much space in the combat
    vessels; instead, their cavernous cargo holds had a very specific purpose, housing
    rows and rows, layer upon layer of holding cells designed to store humanoid \u201Cpassengers.\u201D
    The ships dropped through the atmosphere unimpeded, by squadrons, a perfectly
    orchestrated meteor shower.\n\nThe hypnotizing spectacle of the massive bronze
    ships, still glowing from the heat of atmospheric entry, turned to panic as they
    slowed to hover several hundred meters above the ground. A horrible grinding rolled
    forth from each one as gigantic bay doors slid open, unleashing a barely visible
    cloud of buzzing creatures that glittered as they caught the light. Undetectable
    except in vast quantities, these tiny cybernetic parasites drifted down over every
    population center, almost weightless, wafting in through unshielded windows, exposed
    ventilation systems, even exhaust ports that lacked the proper filters used on
    more densely populated worlds.\n\nBefore the victims below could understand what
    was happening, the nanites had already passed through the outer layer of skin,
    navigated the bloodstream, and attached themselves to the base of their spinal
    cords. When enough of the insidious little things had amassed in a single person,
    they begin to emit rhythmic electrical pulses \u2015 not enough to disrupt higher
    brain functions, but more than enough to overpower the simple neural pathways
    below the neck. People screamed and shouted, struggled in vain, and cried pitifully
    for help, but their bodies wouldn\u2019t respond. They walked out into the green
    tinted glare of wide-angle tractor beams, which lifted them off the ground by
    the thousands. Their bodies tumbled slowly, out of control, up into the waiting
    dropships.\n\nBut then the dark sky lit up with different colors. Sparkling blue
    explosions and brilliant red contrails streaked across the night. The capsuleers
    had arrived.\n\nArriving sporadically at first, then in greater numbers and with
    more organization, they warped onto the battlefield in high orbit above the planet
    and opened fire with reckless voracity. Their ships\u2019 advanced electronics
    systems and powerful defensive measures shrugged off the Nation\u2019s viral broadcast,
    allowing them to unleash a hail of guided missiles, artillery slugs, and incorruptible
    attack drones. They punished the Sansha vessels with their assault, but suffered
    a coordinated counterattack as the invading fleet systematically chose one target
    at a time, focusing all of its considerable firepower against the unfortunate
    subject.\n\nSensing the imminent danger to their ground operation, the dropships
    began to lift off of the surface all at once, not quite full yet, taking tens
    of thousands of citizens with them. They rocketed back up through the atmosphere
    on solid fuel jets, back to the safety of the wormhole. Stray weapons fire from
    both sides caused more than a few of them to explode, get knocked hopelessly off
    course, or suffer hull breaches, sending thousands of paralyzed humans spiraling
    out into space.\n\nFor over an hour the battle raged, until the intervening void
    was clouded with dissipating particulate matter, the twisted wreckage of starships,
    and the corpses of those who had once crewed them. By that time, capsuleers had
    gained the upper hand, their resilient starships taking on many times their number
    of antiquated Sansha battleships.\n\nThe wormhole pulsed once more, sending static
    through every local starship\u2019s sensors. When scanners came back online and
    searched for targets, a new contact had arrived: The massive carrier was shrouded
    in a layer of projected energy shielding so thick that one could barely see the
    heavy armor plates beneath. The fighter bays along the monstrosity\u2019s hull
    were closed, for it had no intention of launching any. Instead, its supplemental
    capacitors spun to life, sizzling with an overabundance of power as relay switches
    connected them directly to the built-in shield emitters. The field created was
    far more powerful than a normal shield but highly unstable. That was the point.\n\nA
    tremendous blast of energy spread out in a spherical pattern, physically pushing
    ships away with the crushing force of charged gravitons. Attack drones simply
    evaporated as the weapon, designed to cause significant damage to much larger
    ships, reduced them to glittering pieces of superheated metal. Smaller capsuleer
    ships survived one or two bursts, perhaps, but by the time five waves had passed,
    everything smaller than a cruiser had disintegrated.\n\nThe capsuleers adapted
    to the situation quickly, though, adjusting their trajectories and cycling new
    ammunition into their weapons. Mere seconds after it had arrived, the carrier
    was inundated with a withering barrage of destruction. Scorching laser fire, armor
    piercing projectiles, tactical warheads, and superheated plasma bolts rained down
    until even its remarkably powerful shield system was spent. It listed awkwardly
    in space after losing control, but only for a few seconds before the relentless
    capsuleers closed in to finish the kill. After a few moments of smaller explosions
    tearing apart individual segments of its hull, the Sansha carrier\u2019s thermonuclear
    generator released a blinding flash of light, incinerating the entire internal
    structure of the ship and leaving nothing but a charred husk of superstructure
    behind, slowly spinning as pieces continued to break off and drift away.\n\nUnable
    to sustain a viable signal with the flagship destroyed, the wormhole wavered slightly,
    then vanished, abruptly ending the communications static and returning the system
    to a tentative state of normalcy. The invasion had ended, but the war was long
    from over. The capsuleers who weren\u2019t busy salvaging the wreckage or attacking
    one another over the right to do so warped away one at a time or in small groups.
    They didn\u2019t know when or where Sansha would strike next, but they knew that,
    with each empire\u2019s defenses caught off guard and rendered all but unable
    to respond, they were New Eden\u2019s only hope for a sustainable defense.\n"
