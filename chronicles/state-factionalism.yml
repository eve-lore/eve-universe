    the outsider and the uninformed, the Caldari State seems a solid, unified entity.
    This has been true for brief periods of their history. The latest of those is
    now coming to an end. The eight Caldari mega corporations, like all great cynics,
    know the price of everything but the value of nothing and this is now tearing
    them apart.\n\nThree blocks have formed around different ideologies, mainly in
    regard to foreign policies. While the forming of these blocks does not threaten
    the fabric of Caldari society it may very well move the Caldari State in a radical
    new direction in regards to their relations with the other empires.\n\nHistorians
    have pointed out parallels between the current situations and those found shortly
    after the Gallente-Caldari War started. Then, the mega corporations split into
    two groups, one that wanted to pursue peace negotiations with the Gallenteans
    and another that wanted all out war. The matter was solved during the Morning
    of Reasoning, when during a morning meeting of the Chief Executive Panel the warmonger
    corporations forced the CEOs of the other corporations to perform the Tea Maker
    Ceremony. The CEOs had to drink poisoned tea; if the Maker looked favorably upon
    them they would be saved, otherwise their crimes would be confirmed by their deaths.
    They all died and the warmonger corporations (the current mega corporations) split
    the assets of the fallen corporations between them and escalated to total war.
    Although the Caldari State is not currently at war, the political situation is
    similar in a number of ways and many fear that drastic events may be on the horizon,
    with the corporations busily drawing the battle lines.\n\nThe three factions that
    are becoming evermore apparent are each led by one of the large mega corporations
    with other mega corporations, as well as lesser corporations, closing the ranks
    behind them. At this early stage it is impossible to tell which faction has the
    most strength as they seem equally poised.\n\nHeading the self-proclaimed \u201Cpracticals\u201D
    faction is the huge Sukuuvestaa Corporation. The SuVee, as it is commonly known,
    is one of the oldest Caldari corporations, matched only by the Kaalakiota Corporation
    in size. The exploiters, which also include the CBD Corporation and NOH (Nugoeihuvi)
    Corporation, have practiced unethical business tactics for a long time, as well
    as being frequently associated with organized crime elements. The practicals see
    the other empires merely as na\xEFve markets ready to be exploited by unrestricted
    and ruthless trade where everything goes. The recent Protein Delicacy episode
    serves as a good example of what kind of business these companies want. They care
    little about who is a friend with whom and even less about what long-term political
    ramifications their unscrupulous business practices can have. They are mercantilist
    in their views on trade, believing that profit for one always means loss for another.\n\nThe
    second faction is the liberals, whose views are completely the opposite of the
    practicals in regards to interstellar trade. The liberals believe in fostering
    improved relations with all the other empires, creating a world where there are
    no trade barriers and free-flow of goods. They believe in trade deals that mutually
    benefit the participants and the empires can come together in a peaceful, prosperous
    future world only through cooperation. The liberals are led by the Ishukone Corporation
    and also include the Hyasyoda mega corporation. Their strong position within CONCORD
    is accentuated by their belief that it is their main vehicle in promoting universal
    peace and stability so that trade can flow freely and cultures mingle peacefully.\n\nThe
    third faction is not all that concerned about trade, but more about the place
    the Caldari State enjoys versus the other empires in both military and economical
    sense. These are the patriots and they are led by the Kaalakiota Corporation,
    but also include Lai Dai and Wiyrkomi. The patriots cultivate the Caldari heritage,
    reminisce about the great Raata Empire of old and weep for their lost home world,
    Caldari Prime. The most fanatical of them cry for a renewal of the war with the
    Federation, but they are a minority. The majority sees economical dominance in
    the world only as a tool to promote military power. The patriots are willing to
    negotiate alternative ways to acquire Caldari Prime other than through war, but
    they know that they can only see their dream come true by convincing the Federation
    of the economical and, most importantly, militaristic superiority of the Caldari
    State. This is what they strive for."
