    had a tiring and frustrating day, the kind you don't even want to mull over once
    you've lain down in your bunk. There are too many days like that, these days.
    You close your eyes and what you start seeing is too much for a tired old man
    to take, so you keep them open instead, you look out the viewport at the unblinking
    stars, and you listen to the silence.\n\nThat was what brought him to mind: The
    silence, or rather, the impression of it; that velvet cloth laid gently over the
    air. It never is truly silent on the ship \u2013 the mind merely learns to block
    out all those little noises \u2013 but you don't hear the other crew members much.
    The ship is built to muffle the sound of other people going about their off-hour
    lives. This is good; it gives you a little privacy, and keeps you from losing
    your mind if the person on the other side of the bunk wall in your quarters has
    a sinus problem or likes to sing.\n\nNo, the only thing you hear in that near-dead
    quiet is the ship itself. Adjusting to space. Gently balancing its mass distribution
    and heat. Stretching.\n\nI hadn't listened to it for a long while, not consciously,
    but it felt soothing after the long, rough day. This was not a tour I had wanted
    to sign up for. Our dubious mission aside, the ship itself was not the best and
    certainly not the most well-maintained in the cluster \u2013 even Eren would've
    had a hard time with it \u2013 but we all have our dues to pay. We all have our
    dues to pay, and Eren, who paid dearly, he knew how to listen.\n\n***\n\nEren
    and I first met on a similar tour years and years ago. The technology at the time
    was pretty advanced, obviously \u2013 I live on a goddamn spaceship \u2013 but
    still not nearly so much as it is today. There was, in particular, a dearth of
    reliable automated repair systems, which is a major problem for a type of transport
    that involves shifting a highly complicated piece of technology through an extremely
    simple and deadly medium.\n\nOn ships like that, good hands-on engineers are worth
    their weight in any precious metal you care to name. The best ones tend to be
    more in tune with their machines than they are with the crew, and they get plenty
    of leeway both when it comes to proper procedure and working conditions. Some
    people have a problem with that. I don't. My ship's purpose is to get me to wherever
    I'm going, safe and sound, and forcing some guy to alphabetize his spare parts
    instead of doing repairs isn't really going to help.\n\nThat ship was having a
    hard time of it. We'd managed to avoid taking damage \u2013 I think we were transporting
    some bulky cargo, and we certainly weren't kitted out for combat \u2013 but something,
    somewhere, kept breaking down and slowing our way. Nobody on the crew could fix
    it, not even the people supposedly brought on as specialized repairmen. Eventually
    our team leader announced that we'd be docking a few systems away, a detour that
    would add considerable time to a schedule that was already far delayeddue to all
    the breakdowns. I openly wondered why we were going to all that trouble; if there
    was a special team for us to pick up on that station, or special equipment that
    could detect the flaws in our machinery, or what.\n\nMy boss at the time said
    there wasn't. There was just this one guy.\n\nWe hauled ourselves to the station
    and sat there for half a day. I was put on assist, but I never even got a chance
    to talk to the man. They sent me instructions on how to prep the repair area,
    which mostly involved me crawling all the way into the bowels of the ship while
    lugging a bunch of heavy gear with me. I deposited it in the manner I'd been ordered
    to and waited around in case he'd need anything else, but when someone entered
    it turned out to be my own boss, who told me to get the hell out. Eren couldn't
    be disturbed, he said.\n\nI grunted, got up and left. For some reason the walkway
    lights had been dimmed, to the point where I had to feel my way along the handrails
    even to see where I was going. I took slow steps, muttering to myself in the darkness
    \u2013 not something I usually do, but it had been a long shift and I was too
    tired to keep my mouth shut. It wasn't until I'd made it to the exit that I realized
    what my own stupid voice had nearly hidden from my ears. Someone had been whispering.
    Someone had stood stock still in that dark corridor and whispered, either to themselves
    or to me. I turned and glared down the walkway, and just as the door closed on
    the engine room I saw that stranger \u2013 and I knew it was that Eren guy \u2013
    walk through it, one hand trailing over the metal surface. The vision is still
    burnt into my memory: A younger man silhouetted in the door, his face looking
    up at the bulkhead opposite with that puzzled expression people have when they're
    trying to work something out, his posture that of someone young enough not to
    have to worry about it just yet.\n\nOf course he fixed the problem. He stayed
    onboard for a few days before getting off at our next port of call, and nobody
    spoke to him. We weren't ordered to leave him be, but he gave off that kind of
    awkward loner vibe; and anyway, someone who could just walk in and do what he
    did was not necessarily someone you'd feel safe around. Geniuses \u2013 not just
    highly talented people, or the lucky ones, but actual bona fide geniuses \u2013
    tend to attract either attention or trouble. At that period of my life I felt
    it would be best to avoid the chance that either of those might splash on to me.\n\nI
    didn't see him for years after that, nor did I think much about that time. I was
    doing well. I'd had the good luck of signing on to safer vessels, which is probably
    the reason Eren remained absent from my life. But everything breaks down eventually,
    and after a long haul through dangerous areas with not a lot of time to waste,
    we called on him to patch up our broken machines. As it turned out, I was the
    only man who had ever worked with him before \u2013 if you can call it work to
    lay out the instruments and scuttle out before the band starts to play \u2013
    so I was automatically assigned to do the same. This time I did get to meet the
    man, and while he was very reticent to talk \u2013 and I certainly didn't push
    him \u2013 we got along well in our own quiet way. He looked a lot more worn than
    I'd imagined. I remember being amazed that I'd ever thought he could be younger
    than me, for he clearly wasn't, but then my sighting hadn't been under the best
    of conditions, and heaven knows we all fall short of God's glory in full daylight.
    I enjoyed watching him work, and didn't wonder how he managed to find the exact
    fault in the mess of steel and insulation he was fairly buried in. I think he
    sensed this, for after the work was done and Eren long gone, I got a commendation
    from the captain, and was given to understand that if ever they called on the
    man's services again I would be expected to act as his assistant.\n\nTo my knowledge
    they never did request his help again, but then I didn't stay with them long.
    I'd had enough of the weightless life - there is perfect gravity on ships but
    in some sections they need to shift you a little to the side to accommodate for
    their designs, and walking on walls will get to you after a while. Instead I signed
    on to a colony in safe space, working at a refinery that enveloped well over half
    the asteroid it was located on.\n\nTruth be told, it wasn't more than a few years
    before I was thoroughly sick of that life, too. I guess if you make the jaunt
    into space, and take to it, you cease being the kind of person that takes root
    anywhere at all. Nonetheless, no decent tours were on offer, so I stayed on and
    patiently did my job.\n\nThe break came from the strangest of places. A ship docked,
    which was no great news, but surprisingly it was without cargo and had no trade
    agreements with the colony's ruling corporation. They did need repairs, they said,
    but we could offer them no men or equipment that they did not already possess
    on their vessel.\n\nWhat they wanted was me.\n\nThey needed the services of a
    specialist, they said, and were on route to the system where he was located. It
    was quite a few jumps from here, but the expense was negligible when compared
    to the losses they would incur over the upcoming weeks and months if they didn't
    stop having breakdowns right in the middle of tightly scheduled deliveries. Supposedly
    this specialist was worth the trip, but he would only sign up if an assistant
    were brought on as well. Someone who had extensive mechanical experience, but
    more importantly, someone who had worked with him before. Someone like me.\n\nI
    grabbed the chance. Packed my things, signed the waivers, got to know the crew
    and settled in for the long haul to see Eren.\n\nWhen we met, I was rendered speechless.
    If I hadn't seen him a few years earlier, I would have thought decades might have
    passed. His hair in particular had noticeably thinned out and greyed, and there
    weren't so much wrinkles as deep grooves in his skin, etched there by pressures
    I hoped I would never have to experience. All his movements had taken on that
    slow, methodical pace one sees in people who've gotten too old to have the energy
    for mistakes.\n\nI decided right away not to mention it \u2013 you can't turn
    into that kind of wreck and remain unaware of how it shapes you \u2013 but did
    my part in the ensuing repairs by making sure his tools were always where he needed
    them and often just a little closer than he really needed to reach. I didn't think
    he saved a lot of effort from that arrangement, but I had the distinct feeling
    that having the tools closer than usual would make him more mentally comfortable,
    as if they created a small safe space with no room for outside influence. A protective
    circle, really.\n\nHe seemed to like it. We didn't talk much at first, but as
    the days passed \u2013 mostly spent waiting for replacement parts so we could
    get on with the actual repairs \u2013 Eren opened up a little. Besides, we were
    in the deepest parts of the engine rooms, the ones where everything is exposed,
    and you really don't spend time with someone around machines that can potentially
    kill you without developing at least a little camaraderie.\n\nActually, it's not
    entirely truthful to say he opened up \u2013 at least not to me. He simply let
    his guard down. Two days in I noticed that a quiet murmur I'd assumed to be part
    of the ship's own thrumming heartbeat was, in fact, coming from Eren himself.
    I peered closer \u2013 all ship cores are gloomy and dark, probably because if
    you don't know by heart where every single moving part is now and is going to
    be in five seconds' time, you shouldn't be down there anyway \u2013 and saw that
    he was talking to the metal itself. He was talking to the ship.\n\nHe must've
    heard my breath stop, because he fell quiet, leaned back and said, without looking,
    \"They say things.\"\n\n\"The ... parts?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"Or the ones who touched
    them last.\"\n\n\"Ship parts come from all over the place, often from recycled
    ships,\" I said. I'd meant to imply that he couldn't possibly know who these people
    were, let alone that they were even alive anymore, when I realized what he was
    saying to me. If there truly were voices, they weren't on our side of the veil.\n\nI
    swallowed dry air and asked, \"What do they tell you? How to fix the ship?\"\n\nHe
    nodded.\n\nIt really was very dark in the engine room. \"What do they ... want
    in return?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"To talk. To be heard. For someone to remember the
    stories of the dead, of this ship and all the others where their parts have been
    used. Or even places where this ship has docked, places that no longer exist.\"\n\nThose
    places would have been in space, unorbiting colonies, very possibly pirate ones,
    and very definitely long since fallen prey to capsuleer fire. Deaths, and more
    deaths; and once their graves had been picked clean by the attackers, the only
    usable things left in the wreckage would have been those parts.\n\nCapsuleers
    went through frightening amounts of ships and even colonies on a regular basis.
    I wondered just how many ship parts had been salvaged from the dead. How many
    voices wanted Eren to hear them, all moaning in the discordant choir.\n\n***\n\nLate
    that same evening I was too restless to sleep. I ended up using the ship's dataline
    and looked up a few things, which satiated my curiosity but eliminated any small
    chance I would sleep that night.\n\nThere were, amazingly, other people like him;
    but then, in this vast universe, everything has to exist somewhere. Psychomancy,
    it was called. They could tell things from machine sounds, working them like the
    entrails of a shaman. The buzz, burr, shear and whine; the way the rust stretched
    its coarse surface over them.\n\nMore than anything, the mention of rust unnerved
    me, and I couldn't stop thinking about it. The next day I mentioned it to Eren.\n\nHe
    responded, \"It's true. And I don't like rust. It creeps. It distorts.\"\n\n\"You
    mean it makes it hard to hear the, uh, voices?\" I asked\n\n\"Oh no. It doesn't
    muffle them. They just ... come out distorted. As whines, or these shrieky, tattered
    howls. Imagine the rust was on your vocal cords,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"Imagine
    it going into your lungs. It's a cancer.\"\n\nI couldn't help it. \"So Minmatar
    ships...\"\n\n\"...can go right to hell,\" Eren replied with a grin. He added,
    almost absent-mindedly, \"All ships are haunted. It's like a sea we're on, this
    vast and cold sea. Voices always drift to the warmth.\"\n\n\"You ever think about
    signing up for repairwork on a colony instead? I can't imagine this kind of life
    is easy for you,\" I said.\n\nHe gave me a look, but in the gloom I couldn't see
    it clearly. \"Don't like to work colonies much. Too many buried there.\"\n\nI
    got the distinct feeling there was more to that comment, and I really didn't want
    to pry into the matter any longer. It's bad enough working in the gnashing darkness
    without imagining things that aren't even there. We finished our work for the
    day, and we didn't speak of the voices after.\n\nThe next day turned out to be
    the final one in our stint on the ship. A part we'd been waiting for was finally
    shipped, and I installed it for Eren. I said to him, \"I honestly don't know how
    you're going to get this one going. The team's replaced this part three times
    already, and it simply refuses to work.\"\n\nHe looked at me for a while, not
    unkindly \u2013 I couldn't tell if he was amused or if he was listening \u2013
    and then he leaned out, and he simply touched the damn thing.\n\nThe breathless
    hammering we heard shortly after was one of the crew running into the room to
    ask us what we'd done and how the hell we'd done it.\n\n***\n\nI lay there in
    my bunk, thinking of that time so long ago. It was the last and only occasion
    we'd worked together. I had expected to be called out again, and Eren certainly
    hadn't seemed averse to the idea, but the quality of repair technology had caught
    up and the services of people like him were in less demand \u2013 either that
    or they were being assigned tasks complicated enough to eliminate the need for
    a simple machinist assistant like me.\n\nI did see him once more, years later.
    On a colony somewhere, in a place I left shortly after. I barely recognized him
    at first; it was like he'd been shunted head-first into old age, his body matted,
    wrinkled and eaten up by time and whatever other forces worked on that poor man.
    I didn't say a word, but he acknowledged me with a nod.\n\n\"Tt's the rust,\"
    he said. He thought it over, nodded to himself and repeated, \"The rust. The rust
    creeps.\"\n\nI couldn't help but ask. \"Still the voices?\"\n\nHis eyes were rheumy
    and blinked too often. The skin on his hands slid like oil on water. \"I haven't
    heard the voices for a long time.\"\n\nI was still trying to understand this,
    and the implications of it, when he added, \"I hear what's beyond them now. There's
    something else. There is something behind them and it never falls quiet.\"\n\nHis
    voice dissolved to a mutter. I didn't know whether it was directed at me or the
    machine. Or at whatever lay beyond, which surely knew that he could hear it.\n\nAll
    his hair had fallen out except for the bushy growths over his eyes and in his
    ears, and I could see the veins in his hands.\n\nI lie here on my bunk and I think
    of him. That old soul in that rapidly dying body, and the things he listened to.
    I think quite a lot of Eren, these days.\n\nBecause the ship creaks. The ship
    creaks, and we are going into empty space, and there is a patch of rust in the
    corner, and I wonder if my old friend is calling for me."
