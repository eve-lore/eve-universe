    waiting lounge was cold. There was little ornamentation here, and the only concessions
    to comfort were plastic seats on metal bars that were bolted to the floor. A massive
    window made of transparent alloy showed the traffic out in space, convoys approaching
    and leaving.\n\nTim sat on one of the plastic seats and fidgeted with the hem
    of his robe. He felt tired and worn, a long way from home, and unsure of where
    home was at all. Every now and then he would get up and pace around the place,
    staring out the window at the nothingness beyond, or look down the corridors to
    the people passing by in distant lives and alternate timelines. Everything passed
    slowly here, in the waiting lounge.\n\nThere were no holoreels or any other entertainment
    playing. This was a place of empty waiting, not of recreation. Other lounges had
    more ornate decoration, but they cost more and, to Tim, were pointless. As barren
    as this place was, for the kind of trip he was on - heading back broke from unsuccessful
    seminars, and nursing a broken heart - it was the only valid option for him.\n\nA
    sound, a small growl, startled him. He looked to the source and saw that an old
    man had taken a seat at the edge of the row. The man held a hand in front of his
    mouth and cleared his throat again, a deep, phlegmic rattle. He didn't appear
    to have noticed Tim, and sat quite still in his seat, staring out through the
    window.\n\nTim, a little unnerved at not even having heard the man sit down, wondered
    whether to approach him, then decided against it. He turned away and began pacing
    about again, when he heard the man say, \"You going to mope around like that all
    day?\"\n\n\"What?\" Tim said.\n\nThe man, without turning his head, said, \"I
    don't even have to look at you to know you're wearing a hole in the floor. Sit
    down before you lose your legs.\"\n\nTim walked over to him, not sure whether
    to answer with indignity or politeness, when he noticed that the left side of
    the man's face was overtaken by an implant.\n\nThe man followed his gaze and said,
    \"Ah, hell. Don't you look at this as a handicap. My vision is fine.\"\n\n\"What
    happened?\" Tim asked.\n\n\"Life happened, son. It gets you that way. Sit down.\"\n\nTim
    sat.\n\n\"Thanks. Not that I'm your boss, but I don't much care for looking at
    the stars while someone paces about behind me like a wild animal on the prowl.\"\n\n\"Sure,\"
    Tim said, still trying not to stare.\n\n\"Braten,\" the man said.\n\n\"Sorry?\"\n\n\"Braten.
    Braten Fahr. It's a traditional thing, where I give my name, and you give yours
    in return.\"\n\n\"Oh. Yes, of course. Tim. Shema.\"\n\n\"Pleased to meet ya, Tim,\"
    Brater said and extended a hand, which Tim shook.\n\n\"Likewise,\" Tim said. Now
    that he'd had a moment to get accustomed to the situation, he felt a lot more
    comfortable. This was just some old man, waiting for his ride on one of the cheap
    flights. Nobody here but him and Tim, and somehow that made the solitude even
    more apparent. He probably wouldn't have spoken to this man under normal circumstances,
    but in this time and place, his gruffness seemed quite appropriate and not at
    all confrontational.\n\nThey sat in silence, looking out at the stars.\n\nEventually
    Brater said, \"I'm an old man. Don't have long to live now. So I can wait around
    spaceport lounges if I damn well please. What's your excuse?\"\n\nTim thought
    about this, then said, \"There was this girl...\" He let the sentence hang in
    the air like a war-torn flag.\n\nBrater's expression softened somewhat. \"Everything
    starts that way, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I suppose it does,\" Tim said. There
    was another a pause while they watched a spacecraft fly by, headed for the docking
    ports.\n\nTim added, \"I've been on the run for a while now, though I really don't
    know what from. Just general running, I suppose. And recently, I met this very
    nice woman called Liandra.\" He sat back in his chair, sighed and rubbed the back
    of his neck. \"First time we spoke I got a few words in before a friend of hers
    came over, another woman, and threatened to have me murdered. Turns out they were
    both kill agents.\"\n\nBrater laughed, a deep, quiet rumble. \"That's sticking
    your head in the fire.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Tim said. \"I went my own way, didn't think
    much about it-\"\n\n\"Liar,\" Brater said, not unkindly.\n\nTim stopped, hesitated.
    \"Well, all right. I thought about it for quite a while. How'd you tell?\n\n\"You
    seem a decent fellow. Too nice for your own good. You mull over things, I'll bet.\"\n\nTim
    sighed. \"I suppose I do. You're the same?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" Brater said and grinned.
    \"But I can recognize a moper from a mile away.\"\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\n\"So what happened?\"\n\n\"I
    met her again a few days after,\" Tim said. \"Or, rather, she met me. Without
    her friend, and looking a fair bit more relaxed than when I first met her. She
    asked if she could join me for coffee, and I said yes.\"\n\n\"Where were you headed,
    at the time?\"\n\n\"Into low sec areas. I work for a non-profit organization.
    A bit of missionary work, a bit of social improvements.\"\n\n Brater looked him
    up and down. \"You're certainly dressed the part. Those heathens you were converting,
    not much for showers or washing machines?\"\n\nTim laughed. \"No, I suppose not.
    I have this tendency to let my appearance slide, too. Sometimes it's just too
    much effort.\"\n\n\"Washing yourself is no effort at all.\"\n\n\"That's what I'm
    saying,\" Tim said.\n\nBrater stared hard into his eyes. \"Hard to get up in the
    mornings sometimes, is it?\"\n\n\"You said it.\"\n\n\"And you daren't stop once
    you've gotten moving.\"\n\n\"Precisely. Hence my career,\" Tim said. It felt good
    to talk about the depression, he found, especially to someone he'd probably never
    meet again. \"I have to keep moving. Doesn't matter to where, just so long as
    it's away.\"\n\n\"From everything.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Including your girl.\"\n\n
    \"... eventually, yes. It didn't work out,\" Tim said.\n\n\"So I gathered.\"\n\n\"She's
    a wonderful woman,\" Tim added. \"But she's driven and smart and has this hard,
    hard core that no one could penetrate. Or, not me, at least. And even though I'm
    no slacker, she couldn't stand how I never seemed to put any work into myself.
    She's not unsympathetic. But I think that when she saw other people buckling under
    the weight of their problems, it was a constant reminder that the same could happen
    to her.\"\n\n\"So was it worth it?\" Brater asked.\n\n\"I don't know, man. I don't
    know,\" Tim said.\n\n\"That means it was,\" Brater said.\n\n\"I don't-... well,
    you think?\"\n\n\"Sure. Few things are good through and through. It's all experience
    in the end.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Tim said again. \"I think love can leave a
    sting that lasts a long time. It can leave you worse off than when you started.\"\n\nBrater
    shook his head. \"It doesn't. That sting you feel isn't because you fell in love;
    it's because you were reminded how bad off you were before love took you in its
    arms for a while.\"\n\n\"Even so,\" Tim said. \"All it grants you is a momentary
    feeling that's surrounded by numbness both before and after. Isn't the numbness
    preferable? Just like when you're drowning, you just get real peaceful and calm.\"\n\nBrater
    gave him a strange look, then turned his head away. He inhaled, as if to say something,
    then slowly exhaled and simply said, \"No.\"\n\nA buzzing sound emanating from
    the distance became a little louder. A second later there floated overhead three
    small drones, each the size of a fist. They were on security patrol, although
    they didn't actually have any offensive capabilities. Smaller drones had existed
    for years, as toys and such, but the larger type was a novelty, a side product
    of the recent advances in invention. They were being tried out as remote-controlled
    security monitors, the idea being that their human operators could get closer
    to hot zones in this manner than regular security cameras allowed, and that you'd
    be more likely to behave properly with the possibility of these things swooping
    in to taser you. While they were being tested out, though, the drones would do
    nothing but fly around, floating on their own currents and look more menacing
    than they were.\n\n\"My wife drowned,\" Brater said.\n\nTim stared at him. \"Shit,\"
    he said at last.\n\nBrater replied, \"Oh, I don't think she did that. It'd have
    embarrassed her half to death.\" Then he added, \"Don't look at me that way. I'm
    the one who lost her. I'm allowed to make bad jokes.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" Tim
    asked.\n\n\"Accident. Sailing trip, which I normally detested, but we'd won it
    as some huge prize and the wife was all agog to try it. Biggest company on the
    planet was a sponsor, big hullabaloo, cameras all around. When the time comes,
    we're all packed and taking the steps aboard, there's a misfire in one of the
    ship's engines and it jerks away from shore, tearing up the boarding walks and
    dropping us into the sea. The luggage falls on top of us, along with the boarding
    walks, keeping us from reaching one another. I clamber up and start yelling for
    people to get my wife out. Then the stupid idiot moron captain compensates for
    the drift by firing up other engines and moving the ship closer to harbour, not
    having realized that there was still someone overboard. Eight thousand tons of
    deadweight pin my wife against the harbour wall, crushing the life out of her.
    And all the while, dozens of cameras are shooting her last seconds alive, with
    millions of people watching. Someone reaches the captain and screams to him to
    stop the ship, so he fires up the engines again and tries to turn it away, but
    the engines need time to turn and all they end up doing is providing one final
    push that makes my wife vomit her guts out into the ocean, before the ship drifts
    away, leaving her to sink in a fading red pool.\"\n\nTim, flailing for logic,
    grasped the one detail in this story that his mind would let him comprehend. \"Why'd
    you detest sailing trips?\"\n\nBrater snorted. \"Because I've been a ship captain
    all my life. The sea's not a place of vacation to me.\"\n\n\"What is it, then?\"\n\n\"The
    beginning and end of everything,\" he said without pause.\n\nTim said, \"Well
    ... I don't know. I'm sorry to hear about what happened, really sorry. But that
    sounds stupid to say, and I'm sure you've already dealt with it in your own way.\"\n\n\"True
    enough,\" Brater said. \"Company gave me a huge settlement. With the media angle
    it was the only thing they could do.\"\n\n\"I meant-\"\n\n\"Money wasn't all that
    much compared to what they could've coughed up, but still a fair size. One of
    the largest corporate payouts ever given.\"\n\n\"But the grief-\"\n\n\"And not
    only that,\" Brater continued, \"But they offered me any kind of perks I could
    want, including rides back and forth, new and experimental equipment, anything
    I asked.\"\n\nTim raised his hands, palms out. \"All right. All right. I'll choose
    my words carefully.\"\n\nBrater grunted a reply, then looked down at the floor.\n\nAt
    first Tim thought the man was subtly hinting at the end of conversation, but then
    he saw his eyes follow some movement, and followed his gaze.\n\nOn the floor,
    floating around and over their feet, were cleaner bugs, tiny robotic beetles that
    swarmed over all public surfaces. Each beetle had feelers that allowed it to home
    in on dirt and various pieces of gunk. It would hover over the detritus and use
    a combination of fire and tiny pressure pumps to crack it into pieces, which it
    would ingest and use to fuel its process. The bugs were cheap, easily mass-produced,
    and accepted even by insectophobiacs as an inescapable part of station life.\n\nTim
    saw two dozen such bugs move around in Brownian motion, trawling over the dirt
    left by his shoes, and erasing it as one might erase pencil lines on paper. He
    moved his foot a little to let them at more of the dirt, but in doing so inadvertently
    stepped down on one of the beetles and crushed it.\n\n\"Damnit,\" Tim said.\n\nBrater
    smiled, the first time Tim had seen him do so. The old man's entire face went
    all wrinkly with the expression, as if it had long grown used to emoting strong
    feelings.\n\n\"Figures,\" Tim said. Brater nodded.\n\nTim said, \"Look ... I feel
    stupid now, having told you what I did. I know it's not the same, breaking up
    with a girlfriend as losing one's wife of many years.\"\n\nAnd Brater said, \"No,
    it's not. But it hurts you all the same. Don't ever compare your pain to that
    of others. It isn't made any less or any greater by comparison to theirs, and
    in its proper context it's just as bad for you irrespective of what others may
    be going through.\" He looked out the window. \"And the sea washes all things
    away, in the end.\"\n\nTim said, \"You were a captain. You still are?\"\n\n\"Nah.
    The money from the settlement was enough to retire. I still love the sea. I just
    can't stand to sail on it, at least not on the same ocean that-... well, yeah.\"\n\n\"So
    what're you doing here, away from the sea?\" Tim asked.\n\n\"Oh, it's here,\"
    Brater said. \"Trust me. You just don't see it.\"\n\nTim looked at the old man,
    and the old man looked right back at him. The ocular implant on Brater's face
    came into terrible focus.\n\n\"New and experimental equipment,\" Tim said in a
    dead voice. \"Including modified implants.\"\n\n\"There are waves everywhere,\"
    Brater said, quite calmly.\n\n\"But you might have gone blind, or mad! Unlicensed
    modifications are incredibly dangerous! How could you?\"\n\n\"How could I not?
    Aren't we both sailing into oblivion?\" Brater waved his arm expansively, his
    sweep arcing from the beetles on the ground, to the drones in the air, and the
    ships floating around outside. \"And we float on the waves. Everything we see,
    everything we know, it floats on invisible waves. We create these things to sail
    them, these things that allow us to navigate the dark seas of emotion, but they're
    only temporary; they sink, they cast us off. But the sea, and all that it is,
    the sea remains.\"\n\nTim, open-mouthed, could only shake his head.\n\nBrater
    smiled again, and clapped him on the shoulder. \"I don't expect you to understand.
    Not yet, at least.\"\n\n\"So here you sit, watching the invisible waves.\"\n\n\"That
    I do,\" Brater said.\n\n\"Do you pilot your own ships?\"\n\n\"No, no, not anymore.
    And not in this place. I have enough money to buy me passage on convoys, and that
    is enough. I may imagine I'm piloting them, but no more than that.\"\n\n\"Convoys?
    But most of the ones here are going into insecure areas.\"\n\nBrater nodded .\"As
    am I.\"\n\n\"But that's incredibly dangerous! They get shot down all the time!\"\n\nThe
    old sailor gave him a look that he would never forget. \"Yes,\" he said. \"They
    do.\"\n\nThey stared out at the stars, watching the invisible waves, until the
    roll call sounded, and each departed for his cruise."
