    man in the garish robes and discolored wig was applying he last of his makeup
    when he heard a knock at his door. He scrambled from his seat and nearly tripped
    over his oversized red shoes as he scurried to the door, cracking it open to peer
    at the person outside the room.\n\n\u201CCherall\u2026I mean, Dr. Adad? Sorry
    to bother you, but you have a visitor. She\u2019d like to meet you before your
    show,\u201D said a lady wearing a headset and holding a large datapad. She glanced
    impatiently from side to side, tapping her foot.\n\n\u201CYou know I don\u2019t
    like visitors, Raha. Especially right before I go live,\u201D he replied with
    a hint of agitation.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s a sponsor\u2019s kid. One of the holders
    in the Kor-Azor family. She\u2019ll only be a minute,\u201D Raha whispered. Cherall
    looked down and saw blond curls peek through the door\u2019s frame a full meter
    below his producer\u2019s face. He sighed softly before nodding his head and opening
    the door more fully.\n\n\u201CMy apologies. Come on in, child.\u201D Cherall shot
    a dirty look toward Raha, who offered a short smirk before bustling down the hallway.
    She spoke over her shoulder as she turned a corner: \u201CDon\u2019t forget, you
    go live in five minutes.\u201D\n\nThe little girl looked up at Cherall with wide,
    green eyes as she stepped into the room. Cherall closed the door and smiled at
    her. The wide, red grin painted on his face accentuated his expression, and the
    nanite-infused compound on his cheeks glowed softly as various shapes illuminated
    around his cheekbones, spinning and bulging across his face. The little girl giggled
    at the sight, holding her hands in front of her mouth out of politeness.\n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s
    your name, little one?\u201D Cherall inquired, sitting down in his makeup chair
    gingerly, his knees cracking with the exertion.\n\n\u201CFimiris,\u201D she whispered
    through her hands, still staring at Cherall.\n\n\u201CAre you a fan of the show?\u201D
    Cherall opened a drawer at his desk, rummaging through its contents.\n\n\u201CYes,
    I am. I watch it every day.\u201D The girl\u2019s face flushed a dark crimson
    as she moved her hands behind her back and straightened her posture. \u201CI named
    my favorite slave after Mr. Wayward.\u201D\n\nCherall\u2019s smile softened slightly
    as he continued to search through the desk, opening another drawer and sticking
    his hand deep into its recesses. \u201CThat\u2019s very clever of you. Does your
    daddy mind that you renamed one of his slaves?\u201D\n\n\u201CNo, not at all.
    He finds it rather amusing, as do I.\u201D The girl waved back and forth lightly
    on her heels as she talked.\n\nAfter another moment of intense scrutiny, Cherall
    found the object he was looking for: a thin holopad with his likeness on it. He
    grabbed a pen and scribbled on the image before handing it to the girl. \u201CThat\u2019s\u2019
    very nice dear. But remember, Mr. Wayward is a cartoon character. Your slave is
    a real person, so be sure to treat him well.\u201D\n\nHe handed the holopad to
    Fimiris, who accepted it with a big grin on her face. She giggled again as the
    image altered and played a short scene of Cherall juggling bright, red orbs. \u201CThank
    you, Dr. Adad! I will certainly make sure to treat Mr. Wayward well.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re
    a sweet girl. You remind me of my daughter, you know. You and her would get along
    very well. Now, off you go. I have to get ready for the show.\u201D\n\nAs the
    little girl left the room, Cherall glanced to a sign posted above the dressing
    room\u2019s door. It was a simple wooden placard with blocky letters burned into
    it. The sign contained a short passage from the Book of Reclaiming: \u201CLead
    all children to the light of God, for Heaven is theirs to inherit.\u201D Cherall
    stared at the inscription, deep in thought. After a few moments, his meditation
    was broken by the buzzing of a datapad on his desk.\n\n \n\n* * *\n\n \n\n\u201CChildren
    of God, do you know what time it is?\u201D The voice echoed throughout the mostly
    empty soundstage. A chorus of high-pitched voices responded in unison: \u201CIt\u2019s
    time for Dr. Adad\u2019s Wild Time!\u201D\n\nThroughout the room, dozens of lights
    flashed on and hundreds of children\u2019s faces appeared throughout the empty
    space, filling the area from ground to ceiling with holographic projections of
    smiling children clapping their hands to the upbeat music reverberating in the
    room\u2019s atmosphere. The children\u2019s images flickered as they clapped their
    hands in time to the music. After a few minutes, the clapping turned into full
    applause as Cherall entered the room, running onto a lighted stage and performing
    cartwheels and somersaults across its width.\n\nCamera drones followed his routine
    from multiple angles as he flitted around the stage and spun wildly into the air.
    The music throbbed louder and the children\u2019s applause intensified as Cherall
    completed his gymnastic barrage by launching himself in the air with the help
    of his gravboots \u2013 and floating back down to the stage floor with eight consecutive
    rolls in the air. He landed softly, raised his arms, and the music stopped. The
    children burst into applause all around him, their images flickering more intensely.\n\n\u201CHello,
    children. I\u2019m Dr. Adad, and welcome to my Wild Time!\u201D Cherall bellowed
    to his audience, who applauded wildly in response. Cherall hushed them with a
    wave of his hand. \u201CWe have a very special show to you today, as we are filming
    this live from our studios on Nakregde II.\u201D More applause ensued.\n\n\u201CAs
    always, I\u2019d like to begin this show with a prayer. Let\u2019s bow our heads.\u201D\n\nCherall\u2019s
    painted face retained a solemn expression as he bowed his head. Inside the room,
    hundreds of holographic faces followed suit. Across the cluster, millions more
    children bowed their head in prayer as they watched this live feed, their parents
    smiling with bemusement.\n\n\u201CGod, you are a gracious God, and a forgiving
    God. We do not deserve your blessings, and we submit our lives to you. You bring
    us joy and you bring us sorrow, but we endure everything in your name. Please
    grant us the wisdom and the courage to follow you to Heaven. Amen.\u201D\n\nCherall
    tilted his head up and looked into the nearest camera drone.\n\n\u201CAnd now
    it\u2019s time for the fun to begin! Unfortunately, Professor Playmate is no longer
    going to be joining us in the festivities: He\u2019s back at school teaching the
    Theology of Fun! But not to worry, because his brother will be joining us, and
    I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love Emperor Excitement.\u201D\n\nThe audience was silent
    in response to this news. Cherall panicked briefly, beads of sweat brimming on
    his brow and laughed nervously. \u201CBut while we wait, why don\u2019t we see
    what\u2019s going on with Mr. Wayward?\u201D\n\nThe audience burst into applause
    and many children whooped and hollered in delight.\n\nA smile slowly crept upon
    his face. On the vidscreens across the Empire, children laughed aloud as his cheeks
    flared with glowing numbers, letters, and symbols, the glyphs morphing and moving
    along to a bossa nova rhythm that had emerged in the background. Cherall\u2019s
    eyes followed the glowing symbols as best they could, crossing and uncrossing,
    twirling and darting inside his sockets.\n\nThe clown\u2019s smile intensified
    as the camera drone focused deeper onto his face. The glowing symbols changed
    colors and swirled together, forming more complex images and figures. As the theme
    song continued its rampant rhythm, a person emerged among the glowing shapes:
    a tall Minmatar man, dressed in plain clothes and covered in tattoos. Two more
    figures emerged shortly afterward. One figure was that of a shorter Amarr man
    in elegant robes and pale skin. The other was a large, anthropomorphic furrier
    standing on its hind legs and wearing a dress. A title in big, animated letters
    zoomed over the heads of these characters: \u201CThe Adventures of Mr. Wayward
    and Friends,\u201D followed by the subtitle, \u201CToday\u2019s Adventure: The
    Thief among Us.\u201D Off camera, the children exploded into applause.\n\n \n\n*
    * *\n\n \n\n\u201CCherall, it\u2019s Tadama. They took our daughter.\u201D\n\nCherall
    stared in disbelief at the woman projected onto the vidscreen. Tears were streaming
    down her face and her auburn hair was hanging in front of her face in tangles.
    Cherall cleared his throat.\n\n\u201CWho took her? When did this happen? What\u2019s
    going on?\u201D\n\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D sobbed Tadama. Her bloodshot
    eyes pleaded with Cherall. \u201CThey just sent me an image of her. She\u2019s
    still alive, but they told me they\u2019d kill her if I told anybody that she
    was missing. Except you. I think they want to reach you.\u201D\n\nCherall stood
    up slowly, his knees creaking. He stood on wobbly legs as he moved to the nearest
    data console in his vast living quarters. \u201CHow am I supposed to contact them?
    And who exactly is \u2018them\u2019 anyway?\u201D\n\nTadama entered some information
    on her vidscreen. She sniffed loudly and wiped her eyes with her hands before
    turning back to face Cherall. \u201CI just sent you a contact number. They want
    you to reach them through there.\u201D\n\nTadama glanced around her, panic in
    her eyes. Tears rolled down her cheeks and blotted her collar. \u201CCherall,
    you have to do whatever it takes to get her back. She\u2019s our baby girl. And
    ever since you moved out\u2026. Well, she\u2019s all that I have left. I can\u2019t
    lose her like I lost you.\u201D\n\nCherall winced and looked down at his data
    console. His eyes were bleary and he grasped the console until his knuckles went
    white. \u201CI\u2019ll do what I can, Ta. Meanwhile, I want you to go to the police
    and\u2026\u201D\n\n\u201CNo, I can\u2019t do that. They\u2019ll kill her if I
    do that. Please do what they want before\u2013\u201C\n\nHe raised his hands and
    closed his eyes, a single tear streaming down his face. \u201COk, ok. Don\u2019t
    go to the police. I\u2019ll talk to them first and see what they want. Anything
    to get our little girl back.\u201D\n\nTadama\u2019s face softened, and she brushed
    her mottled hair out of her face, revealing her unblemished, pale skin \u2013
    \u201CGod\u2019s imbued essence,\u201D as Cherall used to call it \u2013 beneath
    her wild, curly locks. Again she wiped her eyes, now raw from this repeated action,
    and smiled half-heartedly at Cherall. \u201CThank you, honey. I love you.\u201D\n\nHer
    ex-husband nodded his head and waved goodbye as he severed the call.\n\n \n\n*
    * *\n\n \n\nThe nanites shifted into place, forming the words \u201CThe End.\u201D
    The camera drone zoomed out to show Cherall\u2019s eyes rolling around and around
    inside his eye sockets, feigning dizziness. The children again clapped and cheered
    as the camera continued to zoom out. When Cherall saw his full image again showing
    on the vidscreen monitors around the stage, he lunged backward into a complete
    triple back flip, and landed on one hand. Spinning in place, he twirled once more
    into the air before landing on his feet and smiling to the camera.\n\n\u201CSo
    today we learned about stealing, and how wrong it is to steal from God\u2019s
    Chosen.\u201D He folded his arms in an exaggerated manner and leaned back on his
    back leg. \u201CAs God\u2019s people, we Amarr are entitled to the bounty of God\u2019s
    creation. The Minmatar, being wayward children, have not earned their right to
    God\u2019s kingdom. Thus, they must live with the lot given to them by us, God\u2019s
    chosen people.\u201D Cherall raised his arms again. \u201CThat\u2019s why Mr.
    Wayward was punished for taking Flonta Furrier from his holder. By stealing from
    his holder, he was also stealing from God.\u201D\n\nCherall twirled in place,
    his body twisting violently as it gained momentum. He pirouetted in a constant
    motion and propelled his body across the stage, continuously spinning as he progressed
    in a figure eight. As he performed his signature \u201CSpindlemas\u201D dance
    to the children\u2019s delight, a woman appeared at the other end of the stage.
    She was dressed in a long, white, flowing dress with a white parasol in her hand.
    Bright red flowers adorned her hair, and brilliant colors flashed across her dress
    as she tiptoed around the spinning clown.\n\nThe children laughed and clapped
    as she followed Cherall\u2019s gyrating form, attempting to catch up with him.
    Finally, Cherall spun in place for several seconds, allowing the woman to sidle
    up to him. She stood on her tiptoes and extended her arm out, putting on finger
    at the crown of Cherall\u2019s multicolored head. Instantly, he stopped spinning
    and beamed at the audience in shock. He turned to the woman and gasped. \u201CMiss
    Melody, I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s you!\u201D he exclaimed.\n\nThe woman curtsied.
    \u201CHere I am, at your service, Dr. Adad.\u201D\n\n\u201CWelcome, welcome. What
    do you have in store for us today?\u201D\n\nMiss Melody turned to the camera drone
    and ran to the front of the stage, dropping her parasol and holding her hands
    together. \u201CWhy, I\u2019m going to sing you a song!\u201D\n\nCherall ran up
    to stand next to her. \u201CDo you mean it\u2019s time for\u2026.\u201D All the
    children in the audience screamed with Cherall in unison. \u201CMiss Melody\u2019s
    melodies?\u201D\n\nThe audience applauded as Miss Melody curtsied again.\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s
    wonderful,\u201D Cherall exclaimed. \u201CWhat are you going to sing for us today?\u201D\n\nMiss
    Melody cleared her throat dramatically, pausing for a beat before answering. \u201CToday
    I will be singing the classic hymn, \u2018The Children of Heaven Will Gather Together.\u2019\u201D\n\n\u201CWe
    can\u2019t wait. Without further ado, take it away, Miss Melody.\u201D Cherall
    bowed to her, then ran backstage as the first notes reverberated throughout the
    hall and Miss Melody\u2019s pristine soprano lilted through the air.\n\nWhen he
    reached backstage, Cherall found the nearest available chair and sank into it.
    He closed his eyes and took deep breath. He became lost in the song\u2019s beautiful
    melody. As he sat there, listening to the music, he cried softly to himself.\n\n
    \n\n* * *\n\n \n\nTadama looked at Cherall imploringly on the vidscreen. \u201CDid
    you find out what they wanted?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes, I did,\u201D Cherall replied.\n\n\u201CWell?\u201D
    Tadama had bags around her eyes from lack of sleep. Her pupils were dilated and
    she had trouble focusing on the image in front of her. She drummed her fingers
    on the data console in ragged strokes.\n\n\u201CThey want me to renounce my faith
    on my program and to cancel the show.\u201D\n\nTadama stopped drumming her fingers.
    \u201CThat\u2019s it? No ISK, no power deals, no nothing?\u201D\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s
    it.\u201D\n\n\u201CSo when are you going to cancel it?\u201D\n\n\u201CI don\u2019t
    know.\u201D\n\nTadama glared at his image on the vidscreen. She grabbed the nearest
    object to her \u2013 an urn \u2013 and threw it against the wall. \u201CWhat do
    you mean you don\u2019t know?\u201D she screamed.\n\nCherall stood up from his
    chair, his knees creaking as he did. His legs were wobbly and he could hardly
    stand. \u201CI just don\u2019t know. That\u2019s not my duty.\u201D\n\n\u201CYour
    duty is to your family. Have you talked to Samne about this? The two of you have
    worked together for nearly 30 years now.\u201D\n\n\u201CSamne\u2019s dead.\u201D\n\nTadama
    gasped. She looked around the room in bewilderment. \u201CWhat? When? How?\u201D
    she stammered.\n\n\u201CThey killed him two days ago. The same guys, these \u2018Bleeding
    Hearts of Matar\u2019 terrorists. They\u2019re a splinter cell of the Bloody Hand.
    They gave me this same threat last week.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhy haven\u2019t I heard
    anything about this yet?\u201D Tadama asked, her voice quivering.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019ve
    kept it quiet. We didn\u2019t know what to do. The Theology Council has officially
    endorsed our show for the edification of the faith. We couldn\u2019t cancel the
    show without explaining it to the Council.\u201D Cherall sat down again with a
    heavy sigh. Across the vidscreen, Tadama followed suit.\n\nAfter a few moments
    of silence, she started to sob quietly. Between convulsing breaths, she muttered:
    \u201CWhat\u2026about\u2026our\u2026daughter?\u201D\n\nCherall sat in silence
    as he listened to his ex-wife\u2019s whimpering. Finally, he said, \u201CI have
    an obligation to my faith to\u2013\u201C\n\nTadama shot up from her seat and yelled
    at the top of her lungs. \u201CFuck your righteousness for once, Cher. They\u2019re
    going to kill Prandi!\u201D\n\nCherall remained silent, his head bowed in prayer.\n\n\u201CYou\u2019ll
    never see her face again because you don\u2019t have the balls to upset the Theology
    Council. What God would allow this to happen?\u201D\n\nCherall raised his head
    and looked Tadama in the eye. \u201C\u2019The road to Heaven is paved with tribulation.
    Those who remain with my flock shall never be vanquished. Their family shall be
    reunited in Heaven so long as they remain faithful to me.\u2019\u201D\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re
    a coward and a fool, Cherall. I\u2019m going to the police.\u201D\n\n \n\n* *
    *\n\n \n\nAt the end of the program, Cherall stood in the center of the stage,
    a single spotlight shining down upon him. He smiled to the camera drones.\n\n\u201CNow
    we must end our show for today. Please bow your head in prayer, children.\u201D\n\nIn
    turn, the children bowed their heads. In the air surrounding his body were the
    images of hundreds of devout faces peering at the ground or with eyes squeezed
    shut, their hands folded in front of their faces, and their lips moving softly
    and silently. Cherall followed suit.\n\n\u201CDear God, you have taught us so
    much today. You have taught us about the sin of stealing; about your love for
    your children; about the sanctity of the body; and about the importance of faith.
    We pray for your forgiveness as we strive to understand your Word, and as we attempt
    to lead the life you have shown us. Please forgive us, for we are sinners. On
    our path to Heaven, we stumble; in our journey of faith, we get lost. But so long
    as we are found again, we are grateful for your blessing. Amen.\u201D\n\nThe children
    raised their heads and stared at Cherall. Cherall, in turn, raised his head as
    well.\n\n\u201CAnd now children, I must leave you for today. Go forth with God.
    We shall be reunited soon with God. Remember that God loves us all. Good night,
    and we\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201D\n\nAs the children applauded for the final
    time that evening, Cherall looked around at all the faces surrounding him, the
    hundreds of visages floating in the air inside the room, staring down at him and
    smiling. A single tear rolled down his cheek as he continued to look at them,
    searching hopelessly for something familiar among all the innocent faces.\n"
