    palace gleamed from a distance, radiating wealth and opulence. On closer inspection,
    it didn\u2019t hold up well in the tropical climate. Starkman Prime\u2019s proximity
    to the unforgiving Arzad sun meant the heat rarely let up, and here moisture had
    caused small cracks all over the walls, with the smell of rotting vegetation permeating
    everything. Today, however, with three men cowering on their knees in the open
    courtyard, the rank smell of sweat and fear managed to override it temporarily.\n\nArkon
    Ardishapur, the royal heir of the Ardishapur family, sat uncomfortably in a chair
    on a raised platform before the three cowering figures and frowned in the heat.
    The insistent buzz of tropical insects made it hard to concentrate as he let his
    gaze travel among the Minmatar slaves before him. They were guilty of rebellious
    actions and would soon be executed, but Arkon sensed they held some dark, sinister
    information, and so hesitated in carrying out their sentence. Arkon glanced at
    his palace secretary, standing expressionless to one side. Drupar Maak was a Starkmanir,
    like the slaves waiting to be executed. He was also a slave, but like many slave
    children that showed remarkable talents, had received a proper education in an
    Amarrian school, which had trained him to become a loyal, obedient civil servant.
    Arkon sighed and turned his attention back to the condemned slaves. They would
    have to be broken.\n\nIt took all of Drupar\u2019s considerable willpower to keep
    his face impassive as he watched his secret associates being put through the wringer.
    Drupar could only admire the slow, deliberate technique of the royal heir as he
    questioned the slaves. Arkon had mastered the skill of breaking a person\u2019s
    will through only words and gestures. When Drupar had heard of the capture of
    the three slaves, he hoped for a quick trial and an even quicker execution. Now,
    cold dread gripped his bowels as he watched the old fool grilling the quivering
    slaves before him. \u201COld fool, yes,\u201D Drupar thought, \u201Cbut devilishly
    cunning at times. Like a dog, he can sniff out conspiracies where no other man
    can.\u201D As much as he loathed and hated the man himself, Drupar had long since
    learned to respect his master\u2019s abilities.\n\nArkon absentmindedly fingered
    his golden scepter as he shifted his enormous bulk from one buttock to the other.
    He felt he was finally making headway with these miserable wretches. As he had
    suspected from the start, they were only cogs in a much larger organization; an
    organization aiming to topple Amarrian authority on the planet. Now, he had only
    to squeeze the names of the ringleaders out of them.\n\nAs the moment when he
    would be exposed as a treacherous rebel inexorably approached, Drupar felt his
    pulse quicken, adrenaline pumping through his veins, heightening his senses. Years
    of careful planning, hundreds of fellow slaves and rebels, all were in dire danger
    of being undone in one fell swoop. The questioning droned on until Drupar felt
    himself act\u2014not deliberately, but as if driven by primeval instinct. Rushing
    towards his master and nemesis, he grabbed the golden scepter, yanking it out
    of the Heir\u2019s royal hands. For a split-second he allowed himself to enjoy
    the look of shock and disbelief on Arkon\u2019s face before driving the sharp,
    sun-flaring edge of the scepter\u2019s head into his master\u2019s neck. Blood
    sprayed everywhere. Chaos ensued.\n\nAmazingly, the aged Heir, blood spattering
    from the gaping wound in his neck, managed to rise to his feet, his obese frame
    quivering in front of Drupar. A mechanical silver hand shot out of Arkon\u2019s
    robes and grabbed Drupar by the neck, and from the corner of his eye Drupar saw
    guards piling into the courtyard, arms raised. Using every last ounce of his strength
    he managed to slip from Arkon\u2019s grasp long enough to shout at the stunned
    slaves, still on their knees. \u201CGet out of here! It has begun! Rise! Rise!\u201D
    he screamed as he was sucked back into the crushing embrace of the dying heir.
    As daylight turned to darkness before Drupar\u2019s eyes, he saw the three youngsters
    escape in the confusion.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nStrong lights illuminated
    the courtyard, banishing the night. The unnatural light made the usually serene
    courtyard bleak and forbidding, but it fit the mood of the few people there perfectly.
    Idonis Ardishapur stared at the faint traces of blood on the cobblestones, musing
    on how bloodstains always managed to mesmerize people, making them conjure up
    all kinds of horrors in their mind\u2019s eye. He listened to one of his lieutenants
    drone on about how the uprising in the city was already spreading outside it,
    and rapidly becoming unmanageable. On his other side stood the captain of the
    royal guard, anxiously awaiting the opportunity to make some pitiful excuses about
    the death of Idonis\u2019 father. Idonis had already heard enough to know this
    was inexcusable.\n\nBrusquely, he dismissed the two men, having no patience at
    the moment to deal with them. Instead, he walked over to where his friend Zoriac
    was standing, scrutinizing the golden scepter-turned-murder-weapon. Briefly, Idonis
    wondered about the symbolism of his father being killed by an item representing
    the Emperor\u2019s will. He would have to reflect upon that during the morning
    mass. But not now.\n\nZoriac gave a curt nod as Idonis came up beside him, but
    Idonis took no notice of it. He and Zoriac, being of the same age, had been brought
    up together, and Zoriac was as close a friend as a future Royal Heir could hope
    to have. Idonis again regarded the scepter with mixed feelings. On one hand, it
    was one of the most sacred symbols of Imperial and Divine authority; and on the
    other it was covered with his father\u2019s congealed blood. Idonis knew from
    reports that some of the rebels were already wielding shoddy replicas as weapons,
    calling them Khumaak in honor of his father\u2019s killer. Idonis\u2019 stomach
    soured at the thought.\n\nNot for the first time this night he reflected on what
    might have been. He had agreed to accompany his father here to these savage lands,
    nurturing some na\xEFve notions that maybe the Word of God could be brought to
    these newly-conquered barbarians.. Idonis now knew that the Minmatars would never
    adopt The Scriptures as their own, and part of him was glad, fearing for the purity
    of The Word in the uncouth hands of the Minmatars. And yet, calling them barbarians
    was now only a figure of speech. Once familiar with their rich culture, Idonis
    could not mock their traditions as he and his friends had done frequently as youths
    back in the heart of the Empire.\n\nInvoluntary, his mind drifted to the little
    hiding place he had down in the city, to the lithe and winsome creature he whispered
    words of passion and affection to during lovemaking. His family and friends would
    be appalled if they knew of his dark-skinned Starkmanir girl, with her almond
    eyes and her smile that was coy and bold at the same time.\n\nWith sudden realization,
    Idonis knew that that part of his life was over. He was a Royal Heir, now. Already
    he felt the weight of a thousand generations of Ardishapurs on his shoulders;
    the burden of the millions of subjects now looking to him for support and guidance.
    The idyllic lifestyle he had enjoyed here on the outskirts of Empire was gone.
    Like great stones grinding, he could feel his priorities shift. He felt at once
    elevated and apprehensive. He straightened his back and narrowed his gaze. Zoriac,
    looking at his friend, took half a step back, and Idonis saw that he understood.\n\n\u201CThe
    other heirs will judge you by your actions over the next few days,\u201D Zoriac
    said quietly. \u201CA new heir must prove himself in the eyes of his subjects
    and his Empire.\u201D\n\nIdonis only nodded.\n\n\u201CYou must clean up this mess
    your father has left,\u201D Zorac continued. \u201CYou must send a message that
    you will be a strong leader, worthy to be called a Royal Heir.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat
    are the choices?\u201D Idonis replied, already knowing them full well, but wanting
    to hear them out loud.\n\n\u201CStamp out this rebellion of course, with any force
    necessary.\u201D\n\n\u201CThat will not suffice,\u201D Idonis answered, sickened
    by his own words but knowing they must be spoken. \u201CAs you said, I must send
    a message to the other Heirs. Suppressing rebellions is an everyday occurrence.
    Avenging the murder of a Royal Heir is not.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat would you have
    me do?\u201D Zoriac asked.\n\n\u201CAnnihilate the Starkmanir tribe.\u201D Idonis
    paused for a moment and caught his breath, mentally crushing something deep within
    himself. \u201CInform the orbital fleet. Have our people out of the cities and
    in orbit within a rotation. This planet will burn as a beacon, to illuminate the
    galaxy with the strength of House Ardishapur, and the Divinity of our purpose.
    None shall be spared.\u201D\n\nIdonis looked his friend in the eye as he spoke,
    seeing the regret there. He knew his own eyes showed the same. Regret about the
    life they were to leave, regret about what they had to become, but most of all,
    regret about what they were about to do. He allowed himself one more memory of
    his little hiding place, the long supple limbs of his Starkmanir lover, and the
    dreams he had harbored for the Minmatars. Then he let it go. Royal Heirs could
    not afford the luxury of dream.\n\n\u201CTime for mass,\u201D he said, turned
    on his heel, and headed for the chapel."
