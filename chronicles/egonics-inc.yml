    Gallentean entertainment industry is highly competitive and show biz companies
    are willing to do anything to gain an edge over their competitors. The size of
    the entertainment industry means that a mere 1% shift in market share means billions
    in extra revenue. This has led many companies to employ questionable methods,
    such as espionage and sabotage, while others engage in a constant technological
    race. An example of the latter is Egonics.\n\nEgonics Incorporated is a fifty
    year old company that today specializes in making and distributing music that
    fits each and everyone\u2019s personal taste. There are a few essential steps
    in this process.\n\nFirst of all, Egonics runs and maintains a huge database,
    containing personal profiles of billions of people. The Egonics database is arguably
    the largest database of personal information owned by a non-governmental company.
    At first, Egonics planned to use this database for numerous products, but only
    the musical one became truly successful. Early on, conservatists within the Gallentean
    government vehemently opposed the data gathering of Egonics, but the company ingeniously
    used this opposition to their advantage by rallying the young people to their
    cause, advocating personal freedom of all things. This was one of the major factors
    in the subsequent growth of the company and the \u2018Egone\u2019 became a symbol
    of liberty among young people everywhere.\n\nThe information in the Egonics database
    is extremely detailed, it lists both the social status of a person: job, education,
    marital status and so on, but also very thorough genealogical and biological data,
    including DNA samples. Egonics uses every method possible to enlarge their database
    and keep it up to date. Some of these methods are frowned upon by many, but others
    find it good how dedicated the company is in making sure the customer gets exactly
    what he likes and there are some that thrive on selling Egonics DNA samples from
    people not in their vast database.\n\nSecondly, Egonics employ thousands of sound
    engineers and musicians that are constantly creating music according to the specs
    of a certain group of customers. Egonics recognizes hundreds of distinct taste
    patterns in the populace and they make sure that everybody can find music that
    caters to their very special preferences, thus Egonics publish thousands of songs
    every single day. Although the musicians employed by Egonics are total non-entities
    while in its service, they gain invaluable experience during their stay and a
    number of them have gone onto fame after their stint there.\n\nAnd finally, Egonics
    use a unique method in distributing their music to their customers. The Egone
    may look like a head ornament instead of a headphone. This is because it doesn\u2019t
    broadcast sound to the ears as normal headphones do, but instead it projects the
    music directly to the zones in the brain that govern hearing, bypassing the ear
    altogether. This has many obvious advantages, both for Egonics and the customer.
    Most importantly, there is no danger of illegal copying and distribution, as there
    is no actual sound to record. Also, there is no noise pollution and people can
    easily converse with each other as the ears are clear.\n\nMusic is broadcasted
    to the Egone over wavelength, similar to radio, so in effect every Egonics customer
    is listening to his own personal radio station, playing only those songs he likes
    and has paid for.\n\nAll in all, Egonics is steadily increasing their popularity,
    although there are many that find the ruthless data gathering and intrusive broadcasting
    methods to their disliking. The Amarr Empire has for instance forbidden Egonics
    to operate within their boundaries.\n"
