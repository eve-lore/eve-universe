    Ammatars are descendants of Minmatars that collaborated with the Amarrians during
    the latter occupation of the Minmatar worlds. When the Amarrians were thrown out
    during the Minmatar Rebellion their collaborators fled with them. The Amarrians
    helped their Minmatar allies to settle in a few systems not far from the newly
    formed Minmatar Republic. The Ammatars regard themselves as the true rulers of
    the Minmatars, mainly based around the fact that a fair proportion of the old
    Minmatar aristocracy, or tribal leaders, were among them. In this vein they named
    their domain San Matar, meaning \u2018true home\u2019.\n\nThe term Ammatar was
    first used by the Gallenteans to distinguish between the two groups. Out of convenience
    even the Ammatars themselves started using it, stating that, with the help of
    the Amarrians, they\u2019ve progressed beyond the old social structure of the
    Minmatar tribes. Indeed, the Ammatars have very deliberately abolished many age-old
    traditions of the Minmatar tribal society and embraced some Amarrian ones instead.\n\nThe
    Ammatar domain, San Matar, is semi-autonomous. The Ammatar rulers have full domestic
    control, but their foreign policies must have the consent of the Amarrians and
    their military forces are, nominally, under the authority of the Amarrians. The
    relationship of the two has been remarkably smooth in the past, with no serious
    quarrels.\n\nThe San Matar government is structured the same way as any other
    province of the Amarr Empire, with a governor at the head and district officials
    beneath him prescribing over the various departments of state. These heads of
    state are always Ammatar, although the governor himself traditionally is an Amarrian,
    and acts as the supreme representative of the Amarr Empire. As is to be expected
    not all Ammatars are eager for constant warfare with the Minmatar Republic. Those
    who are the most belligerent of them often feel that the Ammatar state is doing
    too little so they have formed a group of their own to fight the Minmatars. In
    a sense this group is a direct response to the independent rebel groups the Minmatar
    have and the guerilla tactics employed by either side are similar.\n\nSince its
    inauguration San Matar has been in a constant struggle with the Minmatar Republic.
    Both states have expanded considerably in the last decades and now border on each
    other in numerous places. The Republic, backed by the Gallente Federation, had
    the upper hand for a while, forcing the Amarr Empire to repeatedly come to the
    aid of their allies, but in recent years the tables have been turning and the
    Ammatar have managed to set up military installations and space stations right
    under the Republic\u2019s nose\n\nBroad speculation existed for many years on
    where the Ammatar got the support for these conquests, as the Amarr traditionally
    were only willing to aid the Ammatars when the latter were under direct threat.
    Though nothing has been conclusively proven, it is widely whispered that for decades
    the Caldari provided clandestine support to the Ammatar in exchange for the promise
    of mineral rights to the rich territories being battled over. These allegations
    were a frequent diplomatic sticking point between the Caldari and the Minmatar,
    and the mere mention of them rankles both sides to this day."
