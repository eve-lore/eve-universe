    darkness outside the bunker was pervasive, and a blanket of dull fog softened
    the small pockets of light near the two heavily armed men standing by the west
    door. The sound of the distant surf was muted by the damp thickness of the air.
    In front of the two, massive turrets scanned the seas beyond the island. Occasionally
    one of the men would shuffle his feet slightly or look around, as if searching
    for something in the heavy and expressionless night.\n\nPresently one of the two
    looked at his companion and said, \u201COne thing I don't understand.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat's
    that,\u201D the other man replied, his inflection flat as the dark horizon.\n\n\u201CWell,\u201D
    said the first man, cocking his head slightly, \u201Cwhy are they coming all the
    way out here when they could just do the same thing over FTL? I can't figure it.\u201D\n\n\u201CJust
    the way it's always been done,\u201D said the other man.\n\n\u201CSeems like such
    a risk to take,\u201D said the first.\n\n\u201CIt's a controlled risk,\u201D said
    the other. He spat at the soft ground, then rotated his creaking neck with a grimace.
    \u201CEveryone knows everyone else is taking a giant risk too, so nobody pulls
    any tricks. Initial expression of fundamental trust, they say in the manual.\u201D\n\n\u201CYeah,
    I get that, but I mean, the trouble of moving everyone out without people knowing
    about it, getting them here safely... It's just, I don't know, you know? Doesn't
    seem to add up.\u201D\n\nThe other man took a deep breath, let it out slowly.
    \u201CDogma says the face-to-face thing is the most important factor here. Worth
    taking the risk for 'cause it can benefit all those hundreds of millions down
    the line if it makes peace any more possible.\u201D \n\nHe spat again. \u201CThat
    being said, I'm none too sure on this either. All I know is we've been making
    these happen for decades, and the secret's never been spilled and nobody's ever
    died. Obviously someone's doing something right.\u201D\n\n\u201CRight,\u201D said
    the first. He looked down at the assault rifle cradled in his hands, then at his
    arm, emblazoned with the logo of the five stars.\n\n\u201CTonight, the part where
    no-one dies is up to you and me,\u201D the other one said, looking at his companion
    for the first time. \u201CYou understand that much, I'm sure.\u201D\n\nJust then
    a crackling came across the sky. A series of blue lights appeared in the tenebrous
    heavens, streaking down toward the invisible line of the horizon and gradually
    growing brighter.\n\n\u201CWell,\u201D he continued, flipping down his visor,
    \u201CIf you don't now, you will in a minute. Prepare to meet Empress Sarum, sergeant.
    And remember, bow deep.\u201D\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nThe
    chamber was a stark and simple affair on the surface, but the tastefully muted
    lights and the plushness of the furniture somewhat betrayed the elevated status
    of the four people the environs had been designed for. At the center of the room
    was a circular table with a single column of gentle bluish-green light descending
    upon it, expanding at its lower half to a benign arc of luminescence that enveloped
    the entire center of the room. As the four in attendance settled into their respective
    positions, their mannerisms gave no indication that just outside these walls,
    the finest killers from the four corners of creation were assembled and ready
    to strike.\n\n\u201CWell, then,\u201D said Jacus Roden, President of the Gallente
    Federation. \u201CA pleasure to see us all in the same room.\u201D He leaned forward
    and smiled benignly, an act which made apparent a silvery streak of metal running
    down the line of his jaw on both sides.\n\n\u201CI am honored to be in the peaceful
    presence of peers,\u201D said a dark-skinned, white-eyed man whose hulking frame
    belied his gentle demeanor. \u201CIn the name of the Minmatar Republic, Sanmatar
    Shakor greets you.\u201D\n\nPiercing as a dagger, a powerful feminine voice cut
    across the table. \u201CThe Imperial Throne of Amarr welcomes you to the table,
    as always.\u201D The owner of the voice was a statuesque woman whose unwavering
    gaze was fixed on the table in front of her.\n\nA long silence followed in which
    her final words seemed to hang in the air, suspended in the ambient lighting.\n\nFrom
    the fourth quadrant of the table came a deep voice, laced with menace.\n\n\u201CSo
    let's get this thing started, then.\u201D\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\n\u201CRespected
    compeers. Please. We're squabbling.\u201D\n\nAt these words, Empress Sarum and
    Sanmatar Shakor broke each other's gaze for the first time in several minutes.
    Shakor was hunched forward on the table, hands locked together; Sarum was sitting
    straight as an arrow, shoulders squared and nostrils flaring. Simultaneously they
    turned their heads to look at the unassuming bald man.\n\n\u201CWe're not here
    to pick at our differences,\u201D continued Roden. \u201CWe're here to find common
    ground.\u201D His velvetine voice rose and fell in precise diplomatic melody.
    \u201CI can understand that you have differing views on what the last few months
    of conflict have done to harm your respective peoples, but I assure you we would
    all be better served by some more constructive discourse.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat
    does 'constructive' mean to you, Roden?\u201D said Tibus Heth, Executor of the
    Caldari State, his thick arms crossed and his great chin down, steel-grey eyes
    drilling into the man across from him.\n\nRoden smiled sweetly, and for the briefest
    of instants a glow came into his gaze, a flicker of green fire almost too quick
    to catch. He leaned back in his seat.\n\n\u201CTibus, my dear friend. We have
    a great number of differences, you and I and everyone else at this table, but
    we also have several common problems. Problems which are not going to go away
    of their own accord. Problems which, in fact, grow in scope and gravity with each
    passing month. I'm sure I don't need to list the phenomena to which I refer.\u201D\n\n\u201CThose
    phenomena,\u201D said Heth acridly, \u201Caren't problems to all of us. In fact,
    some of us are reaping benefit from them already.\u201D He fixed his gaze levelly
    at Roden. \u201CSo why don't you tell us what *your* particular problem is, Mister
    President?\u201D\n\n\u201CMy problem, most esteemed Executor, is that we have
    a growing power bloc in this universe of ours that does not and will not ever
    share a seat at this table, or any like it.\u201D\n\n\"Capsuleers,\" said Heth.
    \"Our common problem. Need to find a way to stop them. I think I've heard this
    somewhere before.\u201D\n\n\u201CIs it any less true than the last time you heard
    it?\u201D asked Roden, raising a carefully plaintive eyebrow.\n\n\u201CCapsuleers
    are fighting our wars for us,\u201D said Heth. \u201CTheir efforts are the backbone
    of our struggle. Our squabble, if you'd rather call it that.\u201D\n\n\u201CAnd
    while they're doing that,\u201D replied Roden, \u201Cdo you honestly believe that
    they don't have schemes of their own? Do you think that much power can be handed
    to anyone without some enterprising individuals eyeing the potential for abuse?\u201D\n\n\u201CThese
    people have families, friends, cities and nations they're beholden to,\u201D said
    Heth. \u201CThey have loyalties. Loyalties do not vanish simply because you acquire
    power.\u201D\n\n\u201CNoblest Executor,\u201D said Jamyl Sarum, quiet as a whisper.\n\nThere
    was a small pause. \u201CYour Eminence,\u201D replied Heth, somewhat taken aback.\n\n\u201CHave
    you ever felt your life ripped away from you? Your very consciousness sucked into
    a bottomless pit? Everything you ever thought you were or would be, snuffed out
    in the smallest fraction of a second?\u201D\n\nHeth's brow lowered. \u201CI believe
    I have felt something like that, your Eminence,\u201D he replied.\n\n\u201CAnd
    have you felt your consciousness light up into existence again, as if the laws
    of life and death did not apply to you? As if you were being born again, unbeholden
    to the principles that bind the mere mortals of this universe?\u201D\n\nHeth looked
    down at the table, clenched his jaw. \u201CNo, your Eminence,\u201D he said in
    a low voice. \u201CI have not had that privilege.\u201D\n\n\u201CIt is not a privilege,
    Executor,\u201D replied Sarum. \u201CIt is the curse that has doomed the Empyreans
    from the beginning. It is true that there are some of them who are devoted still
    to causes greater than themselves, but the vast majority are so disconnected from
    reality that they exist in a realm all of their own, where none of the people
    they perceive to be lesser are worth any consideration at all.\u201D\n\n\u201CSounds
    somewhat familiar,\u201D said Shakor.\n\nThe Empress turned her head to look at
    the Sanmatar, whose sightless eyes were fixed squarely on her from across the
    table.\n\n\u201CSanmatar, I am stung by your insinuations,\u201D she said.\n\n\u201CThen
    it's a good thing faith heals, your Eminence,\u201D replied Shakor.\n\n\u201CAgain,
    people...\u201D began Roden, but this time he was interrupted by the Minmatar.\n\n\u201CDue
    respect, Mister President, but this nonsense is intensely tiresome,\u201D said
    Shakor. \u201CI am not a young man and I am not particularly given to frivolous
    wastes of my time. We've all gone to great lengths to be here, so let's not waste
    the precious hours we have, or offend the fine institution that made this possible
    for the greater benefit of all our peoples. Let's all just address the real reasons
    why we came here, and then I'm sure we can be about our business of killing each
    other again momentarily.\u201D\nThe room's three other occupants looked at each
    other, then down at the table. A silent moment passed, then quietly President
    Roden began to speak.\n\n\u201CWe need to discuss the matter of certain new technologies.\u201D\n\n\u201CIndeed
    we do,\u201D said Shakor. Heth nodded. The Empress was grave and impassive.\n\n<div
    align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nAfter the escort was
    successfully over with and the west entrance had slid closed, the door's guards
    were approached by a man with craggy features and close-cropped white hair, dressed
    in cumbersome dark armor that bore the insignia of House Sarum. His gait was heavy
    and assured. As he neared, he thrust out a hand.\n\n\u201CAmon Ahashion, Lord
    Commodore of the House Sarum Imperial Guard, here under provision of Joint Command
    Directive CC-9.\u201D\n\nThe men shook hands. \u201CCorporal Lutiere, DED classified.
    That's my second, Sergeant Ulfbrard.\u201D\n\nThe Amarrian glanced briefly at
    Sergeant Ulfbrard, then held out his hand.\n\n\u201CSergeant Ulfbrard.\u201D\n\n\u201CLord
    Commodore.\u201D They shook hands.\n\n\u201CWe are all in agreement,\u201D said
    Ahashion, \u201Cthat for the duration of this operation the western perimeter
    of this bunker remains under the control of the House Sarum Imperial Guard. Are
    we not?\u201D\n\n\u201CAffirmative, Lord Commodore,\u201D said Corporal Lutiere.\n\nAhashion
    nodded curtly. \u201CIf you need anything, the man in charge on the ground is
    Marshal Commander Kahd. I will be reachable in my quarters, down on the beachfront.\u201D\n\nCorporal
    Lutiere nodded. Sergeant Ulfbrard studied the ground in front of him, his expression
    fixed and unmoving.\n\nWhen the Commodore had made his leave, the younger man
    turned to the older man and said: \u201CDon't think I like him much.\u201D\n\n\u201CDon't
    have to like him,\u201D replied Corporal Lutiere, slinging his rifle across his
    shoulder. \u201CBut for the time being, you do have to obey him.\u201D\n\n<div
    align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\n\"The proliferation
    is complete,\" said Shakor. \"I'm sure our intelligence agencies have all agreed
    on that by this point.\"\n\n\"And what of it?\" asked Heth. \"We have new tools
    and new methods. Why call a meeting about it?\"\n\n\"An influx of possibilities
    this size,\" said Jacus Roden, \"destabilizes the ground underneath all of us,
    Executor.\" Any semblance of affected mirth had vanished from his tone entirely.\n\n\"I
    suspect that's not all we're here to discuss, though,\" said Shakor. \"Is it,
    Your Eminence?\"\n\nAll eyes fell to Empress Sarum, who was sitting with her jaw
    clenched, eyes cast down.\n\n\"It is not,\" she said presently. \"Though this
    was a convenient pretext, I arranged this meeting for another reason.\"\n\nFor
    the first time on this cold evening on this dark world, Jacus Roden's steel-streaked
    jaw dropped, just a fraction of a fraction of an inch.\n\n\"You?\" he said.\n\n\"CONCORD
    does not always call these summits, Roden,\" said Shakor. \"You of all people
    should be aware of the twisted roads our dance takes us down.\"\nRoden sucked
    in his cheeks, placed his hands on the table in front of him, clenched his fingers
    together. In the depths of his irises, a green fire was burning.\n\n\"Perhaps
    we'd better hear what Her Eminence has to say, then,\" he said, his knuckles whitening.\n\n<div
    align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nThe western beachfront
    was a hive of activity, with Sarum troops constantly moving between hastily erected
    emplacements and surveillance equipment. Looking over the scene, Ulfbrard was
    reminded of slave children playing in the wind-swept courtyards of his neighborhood,
    back before the star, back before everything.\n\n\"See that machine over there?\"
    said Lutiere, pointing down to a small alcove on the beach, where four men busied
    themselves with a large contraption bearing three giant discs that extended threateningly
    toward the sky.\n\nUlfbrard grunted in acknowledgment. \"Atmospheric surveillance,
    right?\"\n\nLutiere nodded. \"That thing picks up every last little heat signature
    given off by anything that crosses the ionosphere in about a fifty-mile radius,\"
    he said. \"They say the tech came from the Cartel originally, though the Amarr
    call it their own, of course.\"\n\n\"They call a lot of things their own,\" said
    Ulfbrard.\n\nLutiere gave a knowing glance at his second-in-command. \"I don't
    disagree,\" he said, not unkindly.\n\nFor a few moments the two men stared out
    at the distant horizon.\n\n\"All I know,\" said Lutiere, \"is if someone's gonna
    come at us tonight, they better have something very special up their sleeve.\"\n\nAt
    this Ulfbrard's posture loosened. He slunk a deliberately lazy look at his superior.
    \"Again with the *all I know*,\" he said. \"If *everything* you knew was half
    as much as *all* you knew, old man, then I'm sure--\"\n\nHe was cut short by a
    distant boom, a quiet thrum more felt than seen, reverberating through the rock
    and seeming to shake the very air. The two men looked at each other, then down
    to the beachfront. Several of the Sarum soldiers were stock still in defensive
    poses, their weapons up and pointed toward the darkness of the tide. Others were
    barking commands into microphones.\n\nAmon Ahashion emerged from his quarters,
    shouting orders. He was met by Marshal Commander Kahd, with whom he exchanged
    a communication by all appearances quite urgent.\n\n\"Polaris One, this is Polaris
    Five,\" said Corporal Lutiere into his radio. \"We have Code D on the western
    front. Repeat, Code D on the western front, copy.\"\n\nThere was no sound from
    the radio. Corporal Lutiere felt his heart begin to race. He held his rifle up
    in front of him and peered at it closely.\n\nPlasma temp gauge offline. Hybrid
    mixing chamber on force manual. No lights, no music.\n\n\"Shit,\" he breathed.
    He straightened up and hoisted his weapon. \"Sergeant Ulfbrard, it looks like
    we've been EMPed,\" he said.\n\nUlfbrard stared at him. \"How?\" He mouthed the
    word, but no sound came out.\n\n\"Your guess is as good as mine, Sergeant,\" said
    Lutiere. \"We need to get down there.\"\n\nUlfbrard flipped down his visor and
    swallowed hard. \"Lead the way, sir.\"\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\n\"I
    am reliably informed that the infantry implant technology has spread throughout
    the cluster,\" said Sarum. \"We are all in possession of it, and no doubt well
    on our way to building our own armies.\"\n\nThe other three at the table remained
    resolutely silent.\n\n\"The reason I have called this meeting,\" continued the
    Empress, then took a deep breath, \"is that this technology in its current form
    poses a significant mutual threat to us, and I firmly believe all of us should
    cease and desist in our efforts to pursue it.\"\n\nFor a brief moment the veneer
    of political prudence dissipated, and Roden and Heth exchanged frankly incredulous
    glances.\n\n\"What...\" began Heth.\n\n\"How is...\" said Roden.\n\n\"Gentlemen,
    please,\" interrupted Sanmatar Shakor. \"Let Her Eminence finish.\"\n\n\"I'm sure
    I need not remind you that the Empire's own Templar program was the first ever
    successful implementation of this technology,\" continued Sarum. \"All the mistakes
    you're making, we've already made. All the lessons you're learning, we've already
    learned. Perhaps the most significant of these lessons is that the Sleepers do
    in fact pose a threat, and that threat is far greater than we had presumed.\"\n\nThe
    three men exchanged guarded glances.\n\n\"Tell me,\" said Sarum, looking at each
    of them in turn as she spoke. \"Your recruits for this new breed of soldier. How
    have they been behaving, post-implant? Any instances of mental instability? Sudden
    forceful dissociative symptoms? Healthy young men speaking in tongues, thrashing
    their heads about hard enough to break their own necks?\"\n\nRoden and Heth were
    stone-faced; Shakor crossed his arms, his expression grim.\n\n\"Those implants
    carry the fragmented consciousness of the Sleepers within them,\" said Sarum.
    \"In some of them, the Sleeper presence is so strong that it can overwhelm the
    implant's host.\"\n\nHeth's brow furrowed and his eyes hardened.\n\n\"What's more,\"
    continued Sarum, \"all Sleeper technology has these fragments within it. The Empyreans
    who today wage war on the Sleepers' outposts to harvest their technology are not,
    in fact, mere resource gatherers, nor are they simple thieves. They are committing
    something far worse than theft.\"\n\n\"Genocide,\" said Heth.\n\nA leaden silence
    descended on the table. Roden was the first to break it.\n\n\"Assuming any of
    this were to be believed, Your Eminence,\" he said, a sharp edge sliding into
    his voice, \"how big is the risk to us?\"\n\n\"The risks are significant and cannot
    be ignored,\" replied Sarum. \"The Sleepers are a civilization older than any
    other - older than New Eden, some believe. They may not exist in our physical
    realm at present, but it looks like that may stand to change. If they continue
    to be attacked in this way, there is no telling what they might do out of self-defense.
    And it is certainly not prudent for us to leave them any openings.\"\n\n\"And
    what would you have us do?\" asked Heth.\n\n\"Accept my gift of alternative implant
    technology,\" said the Empress. \"Created through other means, with no Sleeper
    taint, and thus no way for them to gain a foothold or exact their revenge.\"\n\n\"Your
    Eminence,\" said Shakor. \"With the greatest of respect, you must think us absolute
    blithering fools.\"\n\n\"Sanmatar,\" said the Empress, raising her powerful voice
    so that it resounded off the small chamber's walls. \"Having so recently gained
    your freedom, I would think you of all people would not wish to see others enslaved.
    I started the Templar project because this war has seen too many lives lost. I
    wanted a swift end to it, and gaining this technology was a means to that end.\"\n\n\"You
    wanted to win the war, not end it,\" corrected Roden.\n\n\"In the eyes of God
    and the Throne, those terms are one and the same, Mister President. You understand
    enough about us to know that much.\" Her syllables were coming faster now, rapid-fire,
    words tumbling over each other as her voice gathered momentum. \"The things I
    speak of here today are important. Do not attempt to smother them with petty semantics.\"\n\nRoden
    gave a small flourish. \"Continue then,\" he said.\n\nSarum was pensive for a
    brief moment, seated at the table in regal diplomatic posture, her hands forming
    a small triangle on the edge of the table. She cleared her throat. Her cheeks
    looked sunken and sallow. Droplets of sweat pearled on her forehead.\n\n\"If you
    don't believe me,\" she said presently, \"then answer me this: has the number
    514 played into any of your lost cases?\"\n\nThe atmosphere in the room sharpened
    perceptibly.\n\nHeth leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms. At length
    he began to speak.\n\n\"It's been happening since the beginning,\" he said. \"At
    first we thought it was localized to a particular place. Our first two cases came
    from the same barracks. We thought it was something a few of them had seen on
    joint operations. Some kind of graffiti they'd seen during a traumatic moment
    on Caldari Prime.\"\n\nSarum was staring at him intently.\n\n\"Then it started
    popping up everywhere,\" Heth continued. \"Always the same.\"\n\n\"Blood-red skies,
    strange beings, and the number 514, often written in blood,\" said Shakor.\n\nHeth
    looked at him, eyebrows raised. Roden showed no expression, but his eyes darted
    back and forth between the two men.\n\n\"Exactly that,\" said Heth.\n\nEmpress
    Sarum nodded.\n\nBefore the moment and all its implications were allowed to go
    any further, Roden spoke.\n\n\"What does that prove, though?\"\n\n\"I beg your
    pardon, Mister President?\" asked Sarum.\n\n\"The implants give them strange visions,\"
    said Roden. \"How do you know for sure that Sleeper consciousness is the culprit,
    and not some,\" he made a flippant gesture, \"random subroutine implanted as a
    failsafe by their engineers? For that matter, how do you know this isn't merely
    a quirk of the technology, soon to be ironed out by engineers? Surely those of
    us who are old enough \u2014\" and here he nodded his head pointedly at Shakor,
    \"\u2014remember the spectacular capsule failures of the Caldari-Gallente War.
    To my recollection those stories weren't much better.\"\n\n\"You're not listening,\"
    said Sarum, growing agitated. \"You're willfully misinterpreting my words.\"\n\n\"My
    point, dear Empress,\" said Roden, \"is that there are a million possible explanations.
    Why should we so readily fall on this one?\"\n\nSarum inhaled sharply, straightened
    up, then exhaled slowly through her nose. \"A... most trusted advisor relayed
    his first-hand experience of Sleeper consciousness to me. It is,\" and at this
    her gaze grew distant, \"the most rapturous thing I have ever experienced, and
    at the same time the most horrible. We are literally rending the fabric of their
    self-constructed universe into pieces.\"\n\n\"If the rapture you felt in a digitized
    simulation of reality outstripped the rapture you feel in your faith, then perhaps
    it's time to reconsider a few things, Your Eminence,\" said Shakor.\n\n\"Stay
    with the quips, Sanmatar,\" replied Sarum quietly,\" and watch them destroy us
    because we can't trust one another.\"\n\n\"And what, exactly, have you done to
    earn that trust, Your Eminence?\" said Roden, raising his voice for the first
    time. The effect was pronounced and unsettling, a crescendo of pinpoint syllables.\n\n\"I
    have gone to great lengths to procure a solution to a problem I myself created,\"
    said the Empress. \"I can only beg that you heed my words. I have no gambit.\"\n\n\"The
    Amarr Empire is not particularly known for having no gambit,\" said Shakor. \"So
    you will pardon us if we don't heed your words quite yet.\"\nAs he said this,
    a wave of force passed through the room. Every one of the four felt their ears
    briefly buzz with high frequency, and summarily the hairs rose on every neck.\n\n\"You
    may be running out of time for that,\" said Sarum, and stood up.\n\n<div align=\"center\"
    style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nBy the time they reached Lord Commodore
    Ahashion the western beachfront was awash with running and shouting Sarum troops,
    hastily readjusting defensive plans, corraling men into formation.\n\n\"What's
    going on, Commodore?\" said Lutiere, wholly out of breath.\n\n\"Some sort of electromagnetic
    pulse,\" said Ahashion, his eyes keeping close watch over his men as they spread
    out across the beach. \"We don't know what could have generated one large enough
    to disrupt our equipment. Whatever it is, it disabled communications with our
    orbital forward point as well, several minutes before the blast. We don't know
    what's going on up there.\"\n\nSergeant Ulfbrard felt a cold chill run down his
    back.\n\n\"What are your immediates for our contingent over here?\" asked Lutiere.\n\n\"Spread
    out,\" answered the Commodore. \"Stay hidden. Watch the skies.\" As he said this
    he was looking at something in the far stratosphere above them, and now suddenly
    he began to move. \"In fact, this would be a good time to start.\"\n\nA tremendous
    clap reverberated through the night and a pillar of light appeared down on the
    beach behind a large outcrop of rock. Another clap brought another pillar, then
    another, all of them extinguished almost as soon as they had appeared.\n\nThe
    men on the beach held fast, waiting intently. Fear was pasted on every face.\n\n\"Find
    your men,\" said Ahashion to Lutiere, \"and do it now.\"\n\n<div align=\"center\"
    style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div> \n\n\"This is trickery,\" said Roden, backing
    away from the table. \"I will not have trickery.\"\n\n\"There is no trickery,\"
    said Sarum. \"This is exactly what I warned of.\"\n\n\"You did this, Minmatar,\"
    said Heth. \"This kind of underhanded treachery is your hallmark.\"\n\n\"And how
    do I know it was not you?\" answered Shakor. \"Hallmarks or no hallmarks.\"\n\nHeth's
    brow darkened. Several sharp noises carried in from the outside, shaking the earth
    as they went.\n\n\"We are about to be pulled out of here in the next thirty seconds,\"
    said Jamyl Sarum, looking at the only three colleagues she had in the world. \"Three
    of us will be instantly safe. I do not know about you, Dear Executor.\"\n\nHeth
    nodded. \"My people will take care of me,\" he said.\n\n\"All I ask is that you
    remember my words,\" said Sarum over the growing staccato of noises from outside.
    \"Research the matter. Find out for yourselves.\" She looked at each of the men
    in turn. \"I have arranged for you to receive coordinates to cargo containers
    my people have deployed. There you will find the clean technology I have promised.
    Though you may not believe my words, I pray you will believe the evidence.\"\n\n\"What
    smoke and mirrors, Your Eminence,\" said Roden. \"Absolutely ingenious piece of
    theatre, from beginning to end.\"\n\nSarum shook her head.\n\n\"Ye of little faith,\"
    she said.\n\nOne minute later the room stood empty, and one minute after that
    it was blown to shards, each of which flew out soundlessly past the fighting men
    and into the dark sea, silent sinking monuments to a chamber whose last occupants
    would never see each other in the same room again.\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nWith
    his Corporal's head cradled in his lap and his blood mixing with the Corporal's
    blood on the glinting pavement Ulfbrard gathered his senses just enough to scream,
    and scream *loud*.\nThough it had been intended as a roar, the sound that came
    out was more akin to a gurgle. He supposed it was probably due to the missing
    lung.\n\nBlackness began to paint his periphery. This was it, then. Good a way
    to go as any. Something historic. Nobody there to witness it.\n\nA dark silhouette
    came into his field of view. He narrowed his eyes at it, and as it gradually came
    into focus a sick realization rattled its way down his spine and took hold in
    his gut.\n\nAn armored figure with a matte visor, spread out over the face as
    if to deny even the existence of a face, stared down at him.\n\n\"Evening,\" he
    managed to say, through blood and sand and bile. Ocean air had never smelled so
    fresh.\n\nThe figure stood there for a brief while. Small clicking noises could
    be heard inside its helmet. Then it leveled its weapon at him.\nInvoluntarily
    his breath quickened, choked gasps coming in ragged rhythm. He had often wondered
    what his last words would be; in fact, he had constructed them carefully. He opened
    his lips to speak.\n\n\"Adakul, light of the world...\" he began, but got no further.\n\nThe
    figure resumed its search of the surroundings.\n\nThe horizon was silent and dark."

description: The darkness outside the bunker was pervasive, and a blanket of dull
  fog softened the small pockets of light near the two heavily armed men standing
  by the west door. The sound of the distant surf was muted by the damp thickness
  of the air. In front of the two, massive turrets scanned the seas beyond the island.
  Occasionally one of the men would shuffle his feet slightly or look around, as if
  searching for something in the heavy and expressionless night. Presently one of
  the two looked at his [...]
