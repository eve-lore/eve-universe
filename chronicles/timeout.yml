    four ships registered as red dots on Maya Arikinnen\u2019s radar, but that didn\u2019t
    deter her from activating her cargo scanner on one of them. The four frigates
    were manned by outlaws - characters with a track record of crimes and misdemeanors.
    But Maya recognized their kind by their ships and style. They were not killers,
    but smugglers. This didn\u2019t make them harmless, but they were less likely
    to start some reckless action here in a medium secure system. At least Maya hoped
    so.\n\nTorrinos system lay on the outskirts of Caldari space. Beyond there were
    increasingly less secure areas until one reached the Amarrian border zones some
    seven jumps distance. Although this route was not an official linkage point between
    the two empires it was still a popular path for smugglers or those wishing to
    travel outside the main routes. This was the reason why Maya had positioned herself
    here sporting her newly acquired cargo scanner, courtesy of the Custom license
    she\u2019d bought from the Caldari state. Many of her friends had done this before
    her and all agreed that Torrinos system offered some good pickings. All she had
    to do was to sniff out some illegal or contraband goods and report her findings
    - she would then receive a part of the fine imposed on the offender by the authorities.\n\nThe
    cargo scanner aligned itself with the nearest of the four frigates and started
    its scanning process. But before it could finish it sputtered to a halt and reported
    a failed scan. At first Maya was sure she\u2019d done something incorrectly, before
    realizing that the target ship had used an anti-scanning device on her to counter
    her scanning efforts. The four frigates suddenly veered off their course and now
    headed directly towards her. The menacing advance of the smugglers gave Maya the
    urge to panic and do something reckless, but she managed to get her emotions under
    control. The smugglers had not opened fire on her yet. Maybe they were just trying
    to scare her off. The leading smuggler, the one that thwarted her scanning attempt,
    established a com-link to her, automatically creating a new channel for them to
    communicate over:\n\n\u201CWhaddya think yur doin\u2019?\u201D the uncouth voice
    of the smuggler crackled. \u201CTry one more time to scan us and we\u2019ll fry
    your ass!\u201D the smuggler continued. Maya ran some background checks on him.
    Nori Yirikai. A member of a renowned criminal organization. He had an unimpressive
    track record of smuggling felonies, which maybe explained his current usage of
    a hi-tech anti-scanning device. \u2018Obviously a man that learns from experience.\u2019
    Maya thought sardonically. It was also obvious that Yirikai and his cronies were
    only trying to scare her away, being sensible enough not to be willing to reduce
    their already sorry security standings by engaging in combat here. Yet they must
    be carrying illegal cargo, or they wouldn\u2019t be so concerned about being scanned.\n\nJust
    to be on the safe side Maya asked two of her friends in the custom business that
    she knew were close by to come and join her. She then turned her ship away from
    the smugglers and made as to leave.\n\n\u201CThere\u2019s a good girl,\u201D came
    the voice of Yirikai. Maya noticed he was trying to sound scornful, but it sounded
    more like he was relived. She began wondering what it was they were carrying that
    they were so anxious to keep a secret. It was tempting to provoke them by trying
    to scan them again once her friends got here, one of them might get through. As
    soon as she released that thought her friends had arrived. They quickly aligned
    themselves beside Maya\u2019s ship, which she had promptly turned around.\n\nThe
    smugglers seemed to hesitate for a second. They were probably discussing this
    new turn of events among themselves. Maya and her friends formed a group, so they
    could retaliate in case one of them was attacked. The smugglers started aligning
    themselves in a combat formation. Maya began sweating. She had fervently hoped
    it wouldn\u2019t have to come to this, but it was clear that the smugglers were
    willing to attack them to keep the identity of their cargo hidden. She began preparing
    her ship for the onslaught. But just as the two sides were about to let loose
    their weaponry a new ship appeared on the radar. A big ship. A DED ship. Maya
    sighed in relief.\n\nThe sudden appearance of the DED battleship quickly ended
    any thoughts of battle. Both sides disengaged and starting preparing to leave,
    all under the watchful eye of the DED ship. The channel-link with Yirikai came
    to live:\n\n\u201CYou just watch it, custom officer Arikinnen. Next time, I won\u2019t
    hesitate to kill you.\u201D Yirikai said vengefully. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 Maya thought
    as she warped out, \u2018and I would very much like to find out what you are carrying
    in your cargo hold.\u2019"
