    Enclosed are initial research and preliminary documents for your perusal. We have
    stopped production of this product before it could hit distribution. All implicated

    find below the investigation\u2019s core documentation:\n\n* * *\n\nFrom the journal
    of Yosif Veaulore, Sept. 12, YC 111\n\nI sold out today, and I could not be happier.
    Viladillet\u2019s office sent me their newest offer, and I couldn\u2019t turn
    them down. It was more than generous for my fleet of junkers. Those Quafe bastards
    are losing their touch the bigger they get; either that or they\u2019re desperate
    for the biomass. Quafe+ must be behind schedule. I don\u2019t know why they want
    us to keep at the morgue runs. All I can gather is that it\u2019s to keep an emotional
    face on that lumbering beast of a conglomerate.\n\n* * *\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nQuafe
    Corporations Merges with Lost Stars, Inc.\n\nLirsautton \u2013 The Quafe Corporation,
    through its affiliated development group Quafe Enterprises, has completed their
    merger with Lost Stars, Inc., a Federation-based funerary services agency that
    specializes in cleaning up the aftermath of starship engagements throughout the
    Gallente Federation. The companies agreed to a merger agreement in which Lost
    Stars will join the myriad companies comprising Quafe Enterprises\u2019 burgeoning
    business conglomeration.\n\nLost Stars, Inc. was founded in YC 106 by Yosif Veaulore,
    who started the business with his son, Perime. From the corporation\u2019s beginnings
    as a single frigate retrieving the bodies of crew members from deadspace pockets,
    Lost Stars, Inc. currently maintains a fleet of over 2,000 ships, many custom
    designed for deep space retrieval missions. Through the deal, Lost Stars will
    provide an important role in Quafe Enterprise\u2019s new Industrial Services division.
    \u201CWe are proud to be a part of the Quafe family,\u201D says Lost Stars\u2019
    president Veaulore. \u201CWe hope to provide a human element to Quafe to show
    that there\u2019s more to the corporation than beverages.\u201D\n\n* * *\n\nFrom
    the journal of Yosif Veaulore, March 20, YC 112:\n\nI\u2019m worried about Perime.
    I thought that maybe he\u2019d get better in this new environment. His messages
    are sullen and terse to me \u2013 at least, much more than usual. I made sure
    the Quafe suits didn\u2019t audit his files, and I transferred him to a new ship.
    I\u2019ve done all I can to keep him safe and out of trouble. What am I doing
    wrong?\n\nPerime tried to convince me that this was a bad deal, that I\u2019d
    hurt him if I went through with it. He doesn\u2019t have much to stand on. He
    sold me his shares the last time he got in trouble. It was the only way I could
    keep his problems quiet. This business was his idea. That\u2019s why I still keep
    him on staff, even if he\u2019s under an assumed name. I have to keep him close
    to me; I love him too much. This will be a good change for him, I know it.\n\n*
    * *\n\nAn excerpt from the New Acquisition Progress Report \u2013 Lost Stars,
    Inc., a Quafe Corporation company.\n\nQ2 YC112\n\nFrom the start of the quarter,
    biomass retrieval operations have increased 200% over Q2 last year, though the
    number of retrieval requests has gone down by 40%. Most of the biomass collected
    from deadspace locations and battle sites is reprocessed for use within the company,
    though a small percentage (5%) of the collected human biomass is sold to cloning
    facilities throughout the Federation.\n\nEstimated numbers:\n\nAverage number
    of bodies retrieved from deadspace locations: 5,000\n\nAverage number of bodies
    retrieved from capsuleer engagements (30 ships destroyed): 1,000\n\nAverage requests
    for individuals to be retrievals per engagement: 100\n\nMost biomass retrieved
    from these locations consists of starship crew members who did not survive the
    engagement: Their ship\u2019s hull was breached before they could escape through
    escape pods. This recovered biomass is often unrecognizable, exposed as it is
    to the vacuum of space. When requests to retrieve individual bodies from this
    wreckage come through, the price is often well above normal for funeral costs.
    Upper-income families are the overwhelming majority of clients for Lost Stars,
    as they wish to give their relatives lost to starship engagements a proper burial.
    The Servant Sisters of EVE are also major clients, providing donations to under-privileged
    families to pay for retrieval and funeral costs.\n\n* * *\n\n \n\nFrom the journal
    of Yosif Veaulore, April 10, YC112\n\nThey\u2019ve done wonders with my ships:
    repairs on all the ships, new crews, new equipment. Like new salvage drones (for
    about half of the ships, at least). No more space walks (\u201Cdeath marches,\u201D
    as the crews used to call them). Now they can send those drones out to fetch the
    corpses instead of sending my men out there. Gallente liberty means freedom from
    dangerous work, right? I\u2019m expecting that within a year we\u2019ll have all
    the ships fitted with these new modules. That\u2019ll probably mean massive layoffs
    at that time. That\u2019s the price of safety.\n\n \n\n* * *\n\nPersonnel files:
    biography of Gheyr Aillon, Project Lead for Quafe+\n\n \n\nAillon was born to
    a family of miners in a deep-cavern mining community on Mannar. Both of his parents
    were killed in a deep-core explosion when Aillon was eight years old. He lived
    with relatives and family friends throughout Mannar until he turned eighteen.
    Though impoverished throughout his childhood, he had a natural talent for learning
    and and eloquence beyond his years. When he was of age, he attended the University
    of Caille on a full scholarship. Graduating at the top of his class with a degree
    in Marketing, he entered the Federation\u2019s corporate world in a blaze, founding
    several small companies and turning them into instant successes. Some of the corporations
    folded shortly after Aillon left them, but a few still remain as part of Quafe
    Enterprise\u2019s conglomeration. Three years ago, Aillon became the youngest
    project lead in the history of the Quafe Corporation at the age of 31.\n\n \n\n*
    * *\n\n \n\n \n\nFrom the journal of Yosif Veaulore, April 30, YC112:\n\nPerime\u2019s
    getting worse. I\u2019ve barely spoken to him in the last month. He\u2019s angry
    with me, he must be. To him, it was always about helping people. Am I losing sight
    of that? No, I can\u2019t be. I\u2019m helping more people than ever; progress
    does nothing but good to people.\n\nThat\u2019s why Perime wanted me to start
    this company with him, or at least that was the front he put on. We had lost his
    mother to one of these engagements. She and I were divorced by that point \u2013
    \u201Cirreconcilable differences\u201D \u2013 but Perime loved her so much, and
    it broke his heart when she started working as an engineer for those big, new
    starships. She had only been working the space lanes for about a year when her
    ship was destroyed in a capsuleer engagement. Total destruction of the Thorax
    on which she was stationed. Four eggers caught the ship by surprise in an asteroid
    belt in Intaki. They tore the ship apart before all of the escape pods could get
    away. Verine didn\u2019t make it out. We tried several times to reach the capsuleer
    in charge of that Thorax, pleading for him to help us recover her body so we could
    give it a proper burial. He never returned our messages.\n\nPerime was barely
    a man by that point, but he still had a child\u2019s temper. He went into his
    dark rage, the worst I\u2019ve ever seen him. I lost contact with him for about
    a month. It was only when the hospital contacted me that I knew he was alive,
    though he was badly beaten, almost to the point of death. He never told me where
    he went, but that didn\u2019t matter. I was just happy to know he was alive. That\u2019s
    when he proposed the business to me. I couldn\u2019t turn the boy down, so I promised
    to give it a shot, regardless of the cost. Anything to keep him safe and close.\n\n*
    * *\n\nAn excerpt from a speech by  Gheyr Aillon toinvestors:\n\n\u201CQuafe+
    represents the evolution of soft drinks in New Eden.  With Quafe+, we hope to
    turn our marketed beverages from leisure products to dietary staples. We\u2019re
    in a \u2018want\u2019 market, where consumers want our product on an almost daily
    basis to quench their thirst. But we must expand past this point and turn our
    product into a \u2018need\u2019 market. We must have people needing Quafe+, demanding
    it for their very sake. This need does not have to be a physical dependency, mind.
    We\u2019re not some seedy organization like the Serpentis. Rather, this is a cultural
    need, a social need, and a spiritual need. Quafe+ is the culmination of the familiar,
    a socio-genetic need for any culture. We envision this product as absolutely necessary
    for progress into the future.\n\n\u201CAnd for that, my dear investors, I reveal
    to you Quafe+\u2019s marketing campaign. It\u2019s entitled, \u2018Quafe+: A Familiar
    Taste for a Better Tomorrow.\u2019 We will begin our campaign at the end of this
    year and start selling the product in the Genesis region next year.\u201D\n\n*
    * *\n\n \n\nFrom the journal of Yosif Veaulore, April 30, YC112\n\nWe never wanted
    to make a profit, but we did over time. There were just too many ships out there
    and too much destruction not to grow our business. Even though the capsuleers
    took control of the ship, they still needed a crew. And when they got into their
    territorial pissing matches, when those demigods started to destroy each other
    en masse, that\u2019s when business started picking up. While the eggers could
    lose their ship and their pod and wake up in a cloning vat somewhere, their crew
    members were not so lucky. When that starship exploded \u2013 and it almost always
    exploded \u2013 if you didn\u2019t get into your escape pod quick enough, you
    were lost in the black, forgotten, disgorged, alone. That\u2019s where we came
    in.\n\nWe could empathize; we knew what it was like to lose a loved one to the
    dark void. Verine wasn\u2019t lucky enough to have a funeral. But others could
    be, and we provided that service. It was dangerous work \u2013 we lost about 20%
    of our workers on the death marches \u2013 but it gave someone closure. We didn\u2019t
    want to be profitable, but there was too much business to be had.\n\nThe business
    was all about collecting the dead, harvesting the forgotten. We collected millions
    of bodies over the years. We did our best to categorize them and contact the next
    of kin, and the technology grew quickly over the years. DNA scanners, facial reconstruction
    simulators, biomass regenerators, and biological recursion solvents aided in identifying
    the lost souls. But not everyone could pay our prices \u2013 we were still a business,
    after all. Most of the time, though, we either couldn\u2019t find a next of kin
    or the family didn\u2019t care about our recovery. That\u2019s when we sold the
    bodies for biomass \u2013 human recycling at its nadir. And that\u2019s when Quafe
    became interested in us.\n\n* * *\n\nExcerpted transcript of meeting between Dr.
    Simuel Touvoux, Director of Research and Riesves Boricon, Marketing Manager. April
    14, YC112. From internal communications network and surveillance unit.\n\nTOUVOUX:
    How\u2019re the focus groups responding to the new flavoring agents?\n\nBORICON:
    They can\u2019t get enough of it! Product demand within 12 hours of consumption
    is up 300%. It\u2019s like they\u2019re addicted to Quafe+. I\u2019ve never seen
    anything like it. Your team has done wonders. This is practically alchemy you\u2019ve
    discovered, doctor.\n\nTOUVOUX: It was surprisingly simple to produce the requisite
    flavoring agents, to be completely honest. Once we found the proper source for
    biomass, it was a matter of fiddling with the chemical compounds.\n\nBORICON:
    Where are you getting your biomass from? What\u2019s so special about this biomass,
    anyway?\n\nTOUVOUX: Quafe Enterprises is supplying it to us. Gheyr Aillon says
    that it\u2019s specific to one solar system somewhere in Pureblind. I don\u2019t
    ask too many questions: biomass is biomass, to be honest. Besides, we\u2019re
    already behind schedule on this project already, and we would be even more behind
    if we didn\u2019t find that flavoring agent.\n\nBORICON: Is Viladillet aware of
    any of this?\n\nTOUVOUX: We\u2019re keeping him posted on progress, but not really
    giving him too many details. The old man\u2019s too caught up in developing Enterprises
    to really care about the product even more.\n\nBORICON: All he cares about is
    results, anyway. Frankly, that\u2019s all that matters in this world. This product
    is rather low on the totem pole, but I see the potential for it to revolutionize
    the company. Maybe that will catch his attention.\n\n* * *\n\n \n\nFrom the journal
    of Yosif Veaulore, June 4, YC112\n\nI don\u2019t have much control over my company
    anymore. At least, not the way I wanted. I guess that\u2019s what I get for selling
    out. I\u2019m still in charge of the business\u2019s daily operations, but I have
    no control over its direction. The suits are in charge of that now. It\u2019s
    not about helping people anymore.\n\nI can\u2019t even tell what they\u2019re
    doing with the biomass anymore. Aillon keeps shutting me out of those conversations.
    Our operating efficiency has gone through the roof, and we\u2019re collecting
    more bodies than ever! (It helps when there\u2019s more capsuleers in the sky
    to blast one another into oblivion, but now I\u2019m just being morbid.) I\u2019ve
    been cut off from all of my business partners and all the recycling plants that
    we had deals with. Hell, I can\u2019t even talk to the Sisters anymore. They\u2019re
    still our customer, but they go straight through Aillon\u2019s office at this
    point. That brash bastard \u2013 he\u2019s trying to take too much control. He
    should stick to his stupid Quafe+ project and leave us be.\n\nAnd to make matters
    worse, I can\u2019t even get in contact with Perime. I hope he\u2019s OK.\n\n*
    * *\n\n \n\nIncident Report\n\nLost Stars, Inc., a division of Quafe Corporation\n\nBiomass
    Recovery ship, \u201CEulogy\u201D\n\nMay 10th, YC112\n\nIn the early hours of
    May 10th, YC112, several crewmen aboard this vessel discovered an employee, Eamom
    Delviour, to be stealing biomass from the storage facility aboard the ship. Delviour
    was found in an unoccupied sector of the ship \u2013 formerly the ship\u2019s
    galley, before the \u201CEulogy\u201D was owned by Quafe Corporation \u2013 hiding
    more than 20 bodies in a storage freezer. This sector of the ship was restricted
    to authorized personnel only, though ship logs report that almost no crew member
    besides Delviour had entered the area in at least four months.\n\nAccording to
    the ship\u2019s security investigation, the stolen biomass was preserved with
    embalming liquids and DNA purifiers stolen from Lab C. Each preserved body maintained
    most of its structural integrity, and each body was formerly female. Most of the
    bodies contained some wounds and discoloration throughout the torso area, though
    the causes of these markings are unknown. Significant traces of Delviour\u2019s
    DNA have been found on some of the bodies as well.\n\nBy ship protocol, intact
    biomass is considered a premium and as such is closely recorded. However, as Delviour
    was one of the few space walkers onboard, his biomass collection was never fully
    recorded, which explains how he managed to collect so many bodies undetected.
    The space walking regiment on board the \u201CEulogy\u201D has been dismissed
    entirely and the ship is currently docked and will be fitted with biomass recovery
    drones within the next few weeks.\n\nEamom Delviour has been taken into custody
    by Quafe security, who have performed a complete background check. Delviour was
    operating as an employee of Lost Stars, Inc. under an assumed identity. His real
    name is Perime Veaulore, son of Lost Stars president Yosif Veaulore, and a wanted
    fugitive within the Federation for the crimes of unlawful harvesting of biomass,
    assault and battery, and a classified charge under the \u201CDead Rights Amendment.\u201D
    Security personnel found very few possessions in his bunk area: a few changes
    of clothes, multiple IDs for other assumed identities, and a picture of an Intaki
    woman. There was also a felchon, a plasma knife commonly found among Mannar gangs,
    hidden beneath his bunk.\n\nThe recovered biomass has been destroyed to preserve
    the integrity of the corporation\u2019s product identity. This matter will be
    dealt with internally, and no federal authority is to be notified of Veaulore\u2019s
    crimes against the corporation.\n\n* * *\n\nINTERNAL MEMORANDUM\n\nFrom: Gheyr
    Aillon, Project Lead \u2013 Quafe+\n\nTo: Dr. Simuel Touvoux, Director of Research,
    and Macal Theloux, President, Quafe Enterprises\n\nTouvoux and Theloux,\n\nWe
    have increased our production of biomass for your flavoring agents. Efficiency
    within the Lost Stars operation is up nearly 200%. We have added more ships to
    our fleet and expanded our harvesting range to include Republic space. We are
    also looking to purchase the regional biomass retrieval service, Bountiful Harvests,
    from Boundless Creation within the next few months. With the increase in harvesting
    operations, we should acquire enough biomass to meet demand of Quafe+ upon launch,
    as long as your team can mass-produce the flavoring agent in time. I will keep
    you updated. So far, nobody is aware of the agent\u2019s source, though Internal
    Affairs has been asking questions lately. I\u2019m not worried,though: We kept
    Veaulore around for a reason.\n\nAillon\n\n* * *\n\n \n\nFrom the journal of Yosif
    Veaulore, June 30th, YC112\n\nI sold out, and I\u2019m getting exactly what I
    deserve. I haven\u2019t talked to Perime in months, I\u2019m getting blackballed
    from all executive meetings, and Internal Affairs is breathing down my neck for
    reasons I cannot understand. I just wanted to help people, to soothe them when
    they lost someone close to them. Why is this happening to me?\n\nI have a meeting
    with Theloux and Aillon tomorrow. The suits don\u2019t seem happy with me or how
    Lost Stars is operating. I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re blaming me; Aillon\u2019s
    the one that\u2019s stonewalling me! I\u2019ll find out what he wants tomorrow.
    In fact, I think it\u2019s time I stand up to that bastard. I\u2019ve been out
    of the loop for too long. I need to stand firm, take charge, and steer Lost Stars
    back to the proper course, the righteous course \u2013 the course I started with
    Perime. Then I\u2019ll take Perime out of hiding and put him back on the executive
    level with me. Back where he belongs! They\u2019ll understand why I hid him; Quafe\u2019s
    got the pull to get the charges against him dropped. I\u2019ll try one more time
    to contact Perime after my meeting tomorrow.\n\n* * *\n\nExcerpt from the interrogation
    of Perime Veaulore. May 30th, YC112\n\nOFFICER: Why were you stealing bodies?\n\nVEAULORE:
    The same reason Quafe needs the bodies: I have to fulfill my needs.\n\nOFFICER:
    How many have you stolen since the merger?\n\nVEAULORE: A pittance compared to
    the amount Quafe has repurposed. Do you even know what they do with the biomass?\n\nOFFICER:
    We\u2019re not here to talk about what your company does. We\u2019re here to talk
    about what you did to the company. Tell me: How many bodies have you stolen?\n\nVEAULORE:
    I can\u2019t even count at this point. Everybody\u2019s heads are so far up their
    collective asses that it became too easy. I got greedy, just like Aillon.\n\nOFFICER:
    Give me a rough estimate.\n\nVEAULORE: A few dozen, maybe. I only stole them once
    I got the urges. I\u2019m not healthy, you know.\n\nOFFICER: That\u2019s an understatement.\n\nVEAULORE:
    Though I\u2019m nowhere as perverted as your bosses. My sickness stopped at myself;
    I always gave the bodies a proper burial once I was done with them. But you guys;
    you\u2019re abominations. Especially Aillon.\n\nOFFICER: You don\u2019t know what
    you\u2019re talking about.\n\nVEAULORE: Follow the paper trail. See where all
    this biomass goes once we collect it. Then you\u2019ll see who the real criminals
    are.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom: Dasegne Oleart, InternalAffairs, Quafe Corpoartion\n\nTo:

    Cease Production Immediately\n\nSirs,\n\nAfter a lead from our security personnel,
    we have begun investigations into the production of Quafe+, particularly its flavoring
    agents. The source of these agents, originally described as coming from a particular
    plant in the Pureblind region, has been proven false by independent researchers.
    With the full cooperation of Mr. Theloux, we have investigated the true source
    of the biomass required to produce these flavoring agents: biomass harvested through
    Lost Stars, Inc., an entity within Quafe Enterprises that specializes in collecting
    human remains from starship engagements.\n\nWe have apprehended the company\u2019s
    president, Yosif Veaulore, as we believe that he provided the corporation with
    falsified documents relating to the distribution of his company\u2019s harvested
    biomass. With the help of Dr. Touvoux and Mr. Boricon, who have both provided
    the full documented reports from Mr. Veaulore and his company, we can state with
    complete certainty that Veaulore acted independently of any other entity within
    Quafe Enterprises and Quafe Corporation as a whole. We have also apprehended his
    accomplice, Perime Veaulore, his son and former business partner, who is wanted
    by federal authorities for crimes committed prior to the merger of Lost Stars,
    Inc. and Quafe Enterprises.\n\nAt the request of Internal Affairs, we ask that
    all development and production of Quafe+ be halted immediately until such time
    that we can conclude our investigation.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom: Poire Viladillet\n\nTo:
