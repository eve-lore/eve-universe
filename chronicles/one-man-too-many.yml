    Ancru slowly came to, relishing in the feeling of energy returning to his previously
    limp body. He flexed a few of his muscles, they felt familiar, yet he knew this
    was the first time they were under his direct control. Regaining his senses he
    took in the sterile environment of his surroundings - a small whitewashed, windowless
    room with the med-table he was lying on the only furniture. A somber looking servant
    waited on him. The room was located in his quarters on the Pend Insurance station
    in the Jolia system. Being the chairman and main stockholder of Pend Insurance
    gave him apartments in all their main stations, not to mention wealth and resources
    few men enjoyed.\n\nA man in his position had easy access to the newest technology
    and, as the servant helped him put on a robe, he yet again marveled at this new
    mind-transfer technology. In the few short weeks since he started using it, it
    had transformed his life in more ways than he could imagine. No more tedious space
    travel, no more time wasting on idle journeys through volatile regions. All he
    had to do was set up clones of himself in places he frequented, hook them into
    the mind-transfer machine, and he could whiz halfway through the known world in
    a heartbeat. He could spend the morning in a dour board meeting on Alenia V, the
    afternoon sun-surfing in Maseera and the evening dining at Giraldi\u2019s on Archavoinet
    II. \u2018Ah, yes. Life is wonderful.\u2019 Ancru mused.\n\nEntering his living
    quarters, Ancru had just finished dressing when his servant appeared, announcing
    the arrival of one Jilaine Garat, the Police Commissioner for the station. Ancru
    had met the middle-aged woman before and knew her to be a committed and capable
    officer. Ancru put the last touches to his appearance before heading for the anteroom.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m
    sorry to bother you, sir,\u201D Garat started hesitantly after their formal greetings.
    \u201CI rushed over here as soon as I heard you had\u2026 arrived,\u201D she finished,
    still a bit unsure about this new travel method that few understood or even knew
    about. \u201CA grave matter has come up that needs your immediate attention. But
    first, can you answer me where you came from, sir?\u201D\n\n\u201CFrom Sizamod
    system, I spent the night there,\u201D Ancru answered truthfully. \u201CWhat is
    this all about?\u201D\n\n\u201CLast night senator Papadour was assassinated in
    Palmon and it seems\u2026 it seems that it was you that killed him.\u201D\n\n\u201CMe?\u201D
    Ancru laughed incredulously. \u201CThat\u2019s impossible! Why do you think that?\u201D\n\n\u201CWell,
    the assassination took place at a banquet. We have hundreds of witnesses testifying
    that you were there, with the senator. Can someone confirm you being in Sizamod
    last evening?\u201D\n\n\u201CNo,\u201D Ancru said slowly. He was no stranger to
    smear-campaigns in business or politics, but this went way beyond anything he
    had experienced before. \u201CNo, I was alone last night. Tell me what happened
    at the banquet. How was the senator killed?\u201D \u201CDNA poisoning no doubt.
    The killer - you - coated his hand in poison that only a right DNA combination
    could activate. Senator Papadour\u2019s DNA, in this case. It\u2019s a common
    MO these days. I have here a holoreel from the banquet, if you care to see it.\u201D
    Ancru nodded his agreement.\n\nThe holoreel showed a large, glamorous hall, with
    at least 300 persons seated in their finest livery eating a lush dinner. The picture
    zoomed in on one of the tables, where senator Papadour and a man that looked identical
    to Ancru were seated, amongst others. The people at the table talked and laughed,
    everything looking perfectly normal. Then suddenly the senator grabbed his throat
    with both hands, his face turning red, before he collapsed face-forward onto the
    table, his body raked by a few spasms before becoming totally still and lifeless.
    Commotion ensued, then Garat switched the holoreel off.\n\n\u201CDid you notice
    anything out of the ordinary?\u201D Commissioner Garat asked. \u201CThat was undoubtedly
    you, right?\u201D Ancru didn\u2019t answer immediately, he was deep in thought.
    \u201CIt would seem so,\u201D he finally said. \u201CBut there was something\u2026
    Something not quite right. I just can\u2019t put my finger on it. Can I see the
    reel again?\u201D\n\nThe second viewing didn\u2019t jolt his mind and Ancru saw
    that Garat was becoming impatient, watching him intently. Then suddenly it dawned
    on him.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ve got it! The man - me - was eating left-handed. I\u2019m
    left-handed, but I still eat righthanded.\u201D\n\nGarat smiled at Ancru\u2019s
    words, seemingly pleased.\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s correct. Your\u2026 file states
    this little fact and we noticed it. There were other small peculiarities regarding
    speech pattern, hand movements and facial expressions. Taken together, we can
    only surmise this was a clone impostor. Very professionally done, but not quite
    good enough.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou knew this was an impostor before you came here?\u201D
    Ancru asked.\n\n\u201COf course, but I wanted to gauge your reactions before revealing
    that fact. If we thought it really had been you my\u2026 entry would have been
    more swift and violent. Now let me ask you, do you have any information about
    who\u2019s behind this? Any idea who wanted senator Papadour dead and you in deep
    trouble?\u201D\n\nAncru sat down, rubbing his templates, thinking hard. He and
    Papadour had not been close, but they had rubbed shoulders on that deal with the
    State\u2026 He let his mind wander. The stakes were getting higher. Now, if the
    rumors were true, then\u2026\n\n\u201CI have no idea who did this, Commissioner,\u201D
    he replied at last. \u201CBut it will be fun finding out.\u201D He allowed a small
    smile to touch his lips before summoning his servant to see the Commissioner out.
    \u201COh, yes. It will be fun finding out.\u201D"
