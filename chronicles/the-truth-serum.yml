    style=\"text-align: center;\">\nWhat if Truth was like a tiny speck of sand?\nA
    speck that has been washed and weighed, polished, smoothed and curbed into one
    shiny point, the Universal Truth.\nWhat if we could take this grain of sand and
    collect it into a book? We would treasure the book like our own life. We would
    lock it with the purpose of our mind.\nAnd when we craved the truth we would open
    it up and let the grains wash over us. We would soak ourselves in its depth and
    bask in its radiance.\nBut the book is flawed. We can take more truth from it
    than we have earned. And soon we would be turning empty pages.\nThus the search
    begins. The search for the truth; the truth we crave; the truth that has the only
    meaningful value in an otherwise meaningless world.\nThe search continues, it
    goes on and on. In this search for the ultimate truth everything is allowed. We
    learn to lie and cheat in hope of progress. We see no success, no breakthrough
    of any kind.\n</p></em>\n\n<em><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\nWe\u2019re flooded
    by substitute truth, made up truth, whose only purpose is to sooth us and lull
    us.\nAbsolute truth loses its meaning. There is no absolute truth, only greater
    and lesser truth. We\u2019ve lost our standards, we\u2019ve lost our talent to
    distinguish what is real from what is deception. We no longer know the difference
    between the right truth and the wrong truth. All we care for is truth in any form
    and any guise; corrupted, filthy truth, we want it all, need it all.\nSo this
    truth can make us free, like any other truth. Maybe this substitute truth suffices?
    Maybe.\nBut when we\u2019ve become enslaved to this freedom, then it is freedom
    no longer.\nIt is the worst kind of prison.</p></em>\n\n<em><p style=\"text-align:
    center;\">\nA prison with no walls and no chains. We cannot break free for we
    cannot see what binds us.\nWe talk of freedom like it was something to hope for.
    I hope real freedom never finds us, because we wouldn\u2019t know what to do with
    it.\nYet we continue the search, for the searching has become a way of life for
    us. We know no other. It is what we\u2019ve become.\nLet us only hope the search
    never ends, that the Absolute Truth stays hidden forever. For if the search ends,
    we end.\nThen we become nothing more than dust, specks of sand on the shore of
    universal lie.\nAnd maybe, just maybe, this has already happened.\n</p></em>\n\nThe
    author of this prose is Gorda Hoje, a Jovian philanthropist that died more than
    300 years ago. Hoje was a novelty in his time and age, and his works, which ranged
    from cryptic philosophical texts to meticulous science papers, were generally
    regarded as too eccentric and absurd to have any real value. In his lifetime,
    Hoje acted as a mentor to many of the greatest Jovian minds of the younger generation,
    among them Ior Labron, the founder of the Society of Conscious Thought. After
    Hoje\u2019s death, his followers started to promote his works in earnest and Hoje
    is today regarded as one of the most profound and influential of Jovian intellectuals.\n"
