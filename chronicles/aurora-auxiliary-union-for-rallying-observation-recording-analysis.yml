    Bills abruptly stopped walking, and lowered the datapad. An odd scent wafted from
    an open door, instantly distracting him. He pushed open the door and edged inside,
    only to find himself in a poorly-lit storeroom. A small crate stood open, and
    he reached inside with trepidation. A moment later, he withdrew some of the contents
    - a darkly-colored cigar.\n\n\"Let me light that up for you...\" the older man
    said, as he leaned forward out of a darkened corner, just a few feet away. A small
    tongue of fire snapped to life, making ominous shadows of crates and containers
    dance about the dimly lit chamber. The young officer jumped, dropping the datapad
    to the floor.\n\nNervously, his gaze worked its way across the cluttered room.
    \"What is this?\" He took a breath, and held up his cigar, letting the flame wash
    over the tip. \"Where did these come from?\"\n\n\"Serpentis. Or at least, somewhere
    near there.\" Tarainis leaned back against a crate of holoreels, and took a deep
    puff off of his own cigar. \"Criminals, they may be... but they certainly know
    how to enjoy the finer things in life.\"\n\nBills stared at the old man for a
    moment, then looked back at his own cigar. \"That would make these... well, contraband,
    wouldn\u2019t it? Won\u2019t we get in trouble if...\"\n\nThe fellow gave a sly
    grin. \"Don\u2019t let the lack of uniform fool you, egger. I outrank you, and
    almost everyone else at this station.\" He blew a smoke ring in Bill\u2019s direction.
    \"Besides, none of this exists.\"\n\n\"Come again?\"\n\n\"Some of your comrades
    caught a shipment of boosters coming out of Serp\u2019 Prime.\" He gestured with
    his cigar. \"These were on board, as well. Not on the cargo manifest, though...
    they don\u2019t know where they came from, so AURORA got them. They don\u2019t
    care how we dispose of them, so long as they never see them again.\" He took a
    deep puff, and smiled. \"So, we\u2019re incinerating them.\"\n\nThe lieutenant
    nodded slowly. \"I\u2019ve seen the name AURORA on memos, but never understood
    what it meant. What does it stand for?\"\n\n\"Auxiliary Union for Rallying, Observation,
    Recording, Analysis.\"\n\n\"Ahh... alright.\" Bills looked around the room again,
    for a second, before continuing. \"And what does that all mean?\"\n\nTarainis
    smirked, and reached over to the nearby terminal. The screen flared to life, displaying
    one of the main thoroughfares of the station. CONCORD officials hurried about,
    each with their own agenda and purpose.\n\n\"We handle the jobs that they don\u2019t.
    The ones that fall between the cracks.\" He tapped a bit of ash from the end of
    his cigar. \"We started out as information gatherers, making sure that the right
    information got to the right people. It was only natural that we become the historians,
    as well.\"\n\nHe gestured at a neatly-stacked tower of pressure crates. \"See
    those? Data arrays, due to be shipped out to the archives. You would be amazed
    at what\u2019s in there... Video footage of that battle in Passari. Last night\u2019s
    Clash match scores. Minutes from the Sanitation Committee meeting\".\n\nThe younger
    man coughed, and sat up more attentively. \"Why do you need all that junk?\"\n\n\"You
    never know what is going to be significant, or to whom. So, we collect it all.\"\n\n\"Doesn\u2019t
    sound that bad a job,\" the lieutenant mused. \"At least you get to see all kinds
    of interesting stuff, right? Beats patrolling the inner systems for hours at a
    time...\"\n\nTarainis shook his head. \"That\u2019s what got us in trouble. We
    were just supposed to move information around, to whom it belonged.\" He gestured
    at the viewscreen. \"Look at them. They all have a purpose, a job. Try to give
    them anything even an inch outside of their focus, and they don\u2019t want to
    know about it. It might as well not exist.\"\n\nHe flipped the viewscreen off,
    again. \"That\u2019s why we got our commission. There can\u2019t be a department
    to cover everything, so our job is to take up the slack. And you are right...
    it is a great life. One day I may be following a smuggling trail, and the next
    officiating a wedding.\"\n\nThe lieutenant smiled and leaned back, taking another
    puff on his cigar. \"I\u2019m in the wrong line of work.\" He glimpsed at his
    datapad, and stood up again. \"I\u2019m due in Hanger 3. Thanks for the diversion,
    though.\"\n\nTarainis smiled softly, and leaned back into the shadows. \"Don\u2019t
    worry... we\u2019ll be seeing each other again.\""
