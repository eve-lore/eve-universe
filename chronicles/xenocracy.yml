    Administrator Leonalle Yvesk\u2019s assistant, a much younger Gallente woman named
    Colasa, trotted up and matched his pace as he disembarked from the passenger tram.
    Yvesk sighed vocally. As they made their way up the ramp to street level, flowing
    along with the crowd of other laborers and urban professionals commuting to work
    during the morning hours, she remained silent. Only when they had emerged into
    the open and separated from the majority of the other pedestrians did she venture
    to initiate conversation.\n\n \n\n\u201CGood morning,\u201D she began. \u201CI
    hope you\u2019re well today.\u201D She had a polite but submissive demeanor he
    usually appreciated. It had taken him almost fifty years to climb to his position
    as the highest authority on Chesiette Prime, the first planet of the Chesiette
    system, a thriving temperate world with just over a billion inhabitants. Because
    of its position near the border between the Gallente Federation and Amarr Empire,
    the planet was important \u2013 on paper. In reality, the efficiency of Federation
    politics, combined with their peace-oriented foreign policy, had rendered many
    of his duties unnecessary, resulting in his being regarded by many officials as
    a glorified middle manager instead of a frontier diplomat.\n\n \n\nToday, however,
    he found her meek, subservient manner frustrating. He was on his way to a meeting
    he had been dreading all month, one that he had no experience with, and despite
    the fact that it was finally a duty in line with his diplomatic training, he was
    exceedingly nervous. \u201CWhat is it, Colasa?\u201D\n\n \n\n\u201CI have the
    report you asked for on carbon compound dispersion patterns on the southern continents.\u201D
    She fumbled with a small case as they walked, almost colliding with several people
    moving in the opposite direction.\n\n \n\nYvesk stared straight ahead as he walked.
    \u201CVery good.\u201D\n\n \n\nFrowning, Colasa tucked the case back under her
    arm and hustled to keep up with him. \u201CCan I ask why you seem so upset, Administrator
    Yvesk?\u201D She didn\u2019t wait for him to reply before adding: \u201CDoes it
    have something to do with the capsuleer?\u201D\n\n \n\nYvesk stopped abruptly
    and grabbed her arm, drawing a startled look from his young assistant. He glanced
    around and shot dirty looks at all the people watching, their attentions instantly
    focused on the two after the last word she had spoken aloud. \u201CI think it
    would be best,\u201D he hissed, \u201Cif we kept such topics in private discussion.\u201D
    When he was certain that his point had been made, as was evident by the paleness
    of her face, he released her and stormed off.\n\n \n\nNodding quickly, Colasa
    averted her eyes. From that point until they arrived at the conference building,
    she stayed a step behind the administrator, absolutely silent.\n\n \n\n* * *\n\n
    \n\nSeated in the largest chair in the observation room, Yvesk took a few moments
    to make sure his suit\u2019s collar was perfect before nodding to Colasa, who
    was seated at a nearby holographic interface. She ran one hand over the console\u2019s
    horizontal sensor, prompting the air above it to waver and coalesce into a digital
    readout. Reaching up and tracing one finger across the insubstantial surface of
    the screen, she selected the proper communications channel and turned to look
    at the far wall, which went entirely black, save for the blinking symbol in one
    corner that indicated a connection was waiting for authorization.\n\n \n\nWhen
    an image finally appeared, it caught the administrator off guard. The capsuleer
    was clearly of Amarr descent, with high cheekbones and a clean-shaven scalp, but
    beyond the most obvious features, little of his face could be discerned. Most
    of his head was obscured by cybernetic implants: curved, metallic attachments
    that spread around his skull at every angle, completely concealing his eyes, nose,
    and mouth. Power and information cables stretched from each implant to somewhere
    off camera on either side, making it seem like he was suspended in a spider web
    instead of seated comfortably in a starship in orbit high above the planet.\n\n
    \n\nIt was only a simulacrum, an image that this person chose to portray of themselves,
    but it thoroughly unnerved Yvesk. He caught himself staring at the screen and
    covered his blunder by clearing his throat and introducing himself. \u201CGreetings,
    I am Planetary Admin\u2014\u201D\n\n \n\n\u201CLeonalle Yvesk,\u201D interrupted
    a thundering voice, reverberating around the room with an unearthly tone. The
    camera displaying the man on the screen zoomed in to show only the head and shoulders,
    his body twitching subtly whenever he spoke. \u201CI am familiar with your information.\u201D\n\n
    \n\nYvesk inhaled briefly, scratched the side of his head, then gestured to Colasa
    and offered, \u201CThis is my assistant, Col\u2014\u201D\n\n \n\n\u201CYour associates
    are not my concern.\u201D Interpreting the capsuleer\u2019s body language was
    impossible. After several moments of uncomfortable silence, the muscles in his
    neck convulsed briefly - it really was an unnerving illusion - and the speakers
    continued his statement. \u201CI am Omvistus.\u201D\n\n \n\nThe administrator
    nodded respectfully; his assistant continued to stare at the vidscreen and chew
    on her bottom lip absentmindedly. When it became obvious by the elongated pause
    in the conversation that the capsuleer wasn\u2019t going to finish his introduction
    by clarifying whether the name he had offered was a first or last, Yvesk moved
    on to business. \u201CAs you can see, sir, we are fully prepared to begin implementing
    your production schedule. Our industrial sector still needs some updates and modifications,
    but I\u2019m confident that in just under a year we could\u2014\u201D\n\n \n\n\u201CThat
    is too long.\u201D The expressionless face on the screen twisted slightly, and
    then the capsuleer\u2019s voice boomed through the speakers. \u201CI will replace
    your industrial sector immediately. You have one hour to evacuate all personnel
    before the new facilities arrive in their place.\u201D\n\n \n\nYvesk paled visibly
    as he turned his head slowly to Colasa, who lunged for the nearest control panel
    and began sending out frantic messages. \u201CWe\u2019re making preparations immediately,
    sir. Perhaps if you could\u2014\u201D\n\n \n\n\u201COne hour.\u201D\n\n \n\n\u201CI
    must say, sir,\u201D Yvesk began indignantly, \u201Call of this is highly irregular.
    If you had just included this in your previous documentation, we could have prepared
    adequately.\u201D\n\n \n\nThe cables attached to Omvistus writhed as his body
    convulsed. \u201CYour disquietude is counterproductive. Do I need to replace you?\u201D\n\n
    \n\nYvesk glanced around and stuttered: \u201COf course not, sir.\u201D Licking
    his lips as he chose his next words, Yvesk tried to change the subject. \u201CI
    noticed that you have some ambitious plans for our local spaceport. Would you
    care to elaborate?\u201D\n\n \n\nOmvistus was motionless for several seconds,
    and then his shoulders rose slightly and his voice came through over the channel.
    \u201CYour existing spaceport facility was insufficient for my needs.\u201D\n\n
    \n\n\u201CHow so?\u201D\n\n\u201CThe amount of raw materials that will need to
    be transported into orbit is an order of magnitude larger than what your current
    facilities are able to support. Additionally, I will be overseeing the construction
    of the seventy-two new spaceports my corporation requires, each located at key
    intersections across the surface of your world.\u201D\n\n \n\nYvesk could feel
    the sweat trickling down the back of his neck and pretended to be rubbing sore
    muscles to wipe it away. He was relieved that Colasa was still buried in the computer
    terminal, desperately trying to get evacuation notices out to the industrial sector.
    \u201CSir,\u201D he began, \u201Cwhile I appreciate your dedication to the development
    of Chesiette Prime, I feel it\u2019s my duty to inform you that the scale of that
    project is far beyond our capabilities. Building that many new spaceports would
    cost more than the total revenue our planet generates in a year.\u201D\n\n \n\nOmvistus
    twitched. \u201CI have just purchased all of the required materials to construct
    the new spaceports and arranged for them to be delivered within the next six hours.
    You will prepare for their arrival at once.\u201D\n\n \n\nThe sheer amount of
    currency that had just changed hands before his very eyes, all in the span of
    a single heartbeat, left Yvesk speechless. His mind reeling with the massive numbers,
    he tried to find his footing once again. \u201CI\u2026 thank you, sir. We\u2019ll
    make sure the facilities are properly\u2014\u201D\n\n \n\n\u201CYou will not be
    responsible for their assembly; that process is entirely automated.\u201D The
    capsuleer\u2019s head twisted to one side and his disembodied voice added, \u201CAll
    you need do is stay out of the way.\u201D\n\n \n\nColasa was pleading to Yvesk
    with her eyes, begging for the order to send out additional evacuation warnings
    to any citizens who currently lived or worked in the areas designated for immediate
    repurposing. She pointed to her vidscreen terminal, which showed numerous glowing
    red warnings all over the spinning image of the planet. The administrator, however,
    held one hand up, instructing her to wait. \u201COmvistus, I must protest at this
    point. Most of the coordinates you designated for these additional spaceports
    are located in densely populated areas. It\u2019s going to take more than a few
    hours to evacuate all those citizens. I demand more time!\u201D\n\n \n\nOmvistus
    was absolutely motionless. \u201CYou demand?\u201D\n\n \n\nFrowning and leaning
    closer to the screen to block out the ambient noise of the city beyond the walls
    of the room, Yvesk refused to backpedal on an issue so important. \u201CWe\u2019re
    talking about millions of people here. I don\u2019t think you understand the gravity
    of this situation,\u201D he growled his final word, \u201Csir.\u201D He shot an
    annoyed glance at Colasa when the drone of something outside reached the point
    at which it was difficult to hear himself speak. \u201CWe\u2019re going to need
    at least a week to relocate everyone to unaffected communities.\u201D\n\n \n\n\u201CThat
    sound you\u2019re hearing,\u201D Omvistus replied, \u201Cis your planet\u2019s
    bombardment siren. You\u2019ve probably never had to pay much attention to it
    in the past, seeing as your world is safely under the jurisdiction of CONCORD,
    but that is no longer the case.\u201D As he spoke, the back window of the conference
    room took on a noticeably red tint, saturating the room in crimson light. \u201CWhat
    you\u2019re seeing now is the targeting laser used to aim my battleship\u2019s
    six 425 millimeter railgun turrets. At this altitude, the gravity of your planet
    will augment the standard launch velocity of each solid projectile to speeds well
    beyond operational specifications, enough to obliterate anything within half a
    kilometer of the impact site.\u201D Omvistus\u2019s image grew larger on the screen
    before he continued.\n\n \n\n\u201CAnything between that location and two kilometers
    from ground zero will suffer a worse fate, as the antimatter suspended in each
    shell escapes its containment field and expands in a random dispersion pattern,
    colliding with the ambient normal matter on the ground \u2013 buildings, trees,
    children, everything. Whatever these particles touch will experience matter disassociation
    on an atomic level as, piece by piece, they are reduced to unidentifiable residual
    particles.\u201D He paused briefly, and then concluded.\n\n \n\n\u201CWith a single
    thought, I can reduce your entire city to a smoldering crater; the boiling wind
    rushing in to replace the void left behind will be laced with dust particles that
    were once the bodies of everyone you know and love. Do you understand?\u201D\n\n
    \n\nYvesk looked down to see one of his hands shaking. He swallowed hard and,
    when next he spoke, his voice came out as a raspy whisper. \u201CI\u2026understand.\u201D\n\n
    \n\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry, Administrator Yvesk, but I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t
    catch your last words. Do you understand?\u201D\n\n                                                                                                                \n\n\u201CYes.\u201D\n\n\nThe
    red light faded and, for the rest of the afternoon, the capsuleer spoke and the
    planetary administrator listened with obedience."
