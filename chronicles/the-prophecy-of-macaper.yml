    century ago a Gallentean astrologer named Damella Macaper prophesized the end
    of the world in a book called \u2018The Seven Events of the Apocalypse\u2019.
    Considered a hack and a nutcase by her contemporaries, the book was largely ignored
    outside the small circle of her cult following. A short while later Macaper died
    and her cult died with her as her followers dwindled rapidly.\n\nThe book describes
    seven calamities that will befall the world, culminating in the \u201Creturn of
    the dark light from the heart of the mother\u201D, as Macaper described it. The
    book is written in a stylized prose and even if the general course of events can
    be followed, any detailed information is lacking. It can be deduced that the calamities
    will occur within a space of few months or years at the most, but when or where
    this will happen is not mentioned, decreasing the credibility of the prophecy
    as a whole.\n\nFor decades \u2018The Seven Events of the Apocalypse\u2019 had
    been all but forgotten by everyone except a handful of scholars. But in recent
    months the eyes of the world have increasingly turned towards this old tome for
    explanations. A series of strange natural occurrences around the world seem oddly
    similar to the first calamitous events described in Macaper\u2019s prophecy a
    century ago. Although few believe that the actual end of the world is near people
    is still wary and extensive studies are being carried out into the prophecy and
    other surviving Macaper texts for more clues on what the future holds for the
    world of EVE.\n\nThe first event in Macaper\u2019s prophecy she described as \u201Cthe
    cosmetic kiss of the comets\u201D and this is exactly what happened in a remote
    Caldari system almost a year ago, when two large comets collided head on. The
    clash occurred within the boundaries of the solar system, but not close enough
    to any of the planets to cause any drastic effects. Debris from the comets disturbed
    space traffic for a while, but that was all. Albeit a very rare event, the comet
    collision was not connected to the prophecy at this time.\n\nThe second event
    occurred a few months later when the planet Fricoure in the Gallente Federation
    was literally flooded with rains that lasted for weeks. Scientists could easily
    explain this by citing shifts in the weather patterns in the upper atmosphere
    and it wasn\u2019t until a diligent astrology student pointed out the similarities
    between this downpour and the second event of Macaper\u2019s prophecy that people
    began taking notice.\n\nThe third calamity is described by Macaper as being a
    \u201Croaring stone that silences the world.\u201D A week ago a huge asteroid
    entered the atmosphere of the Amarrian planet Rumida at a low angle. It cut across
    the surface of the planet for hundred of kilometers with a thunderous roar before
    finally slamming into the ocean. In its wake lay the ruins of thousands of homes;
    destroyed by the powerful shockwaves created by the asteroid, the shockwaves plowing
    the earth along a path several kilometers wide. Casualties numbered a few thousand;
    fortunately the asteroid\u2019s impact wasn\u2019t close to settled territories.
    But Macaper\u2019s prophecy came true in a very striking manner; dozens of thousands
    were left deaf by the meteor, as the sound waves streaming around it had exploded
    the eardrums of people many kilometers away from the meteor. The roaring stone
    had silenced the world for all those people and the name of Damella Macaper became
    renowned throughout the world.\n\nFour more events are to take place according
    to the prophecy and speculations about their nature abound. Many claim expertise
    in the prophecies, but none can inform us with any certainty about what is to
    transpire. The fourth event is described by Macaper as \u201Cthe appetite of nothing
    expands over the world\u201D; the fifth is described as \u201Cthe little brother
    makes the final sorrowful steps home; he is not welcome\u201D; the sixth is described
    as \u201Cwhat was many now becomes one when one becomes four\u201D; the seventh
    is mentioned above.\n\nWhat this means is for anyone to guess, but the majority
    of people agree that Macaper\u2019s prophecy has put the fate of humans into perspective
    for the public and the next few months or years should be interesting indeed to
    watch."
