    in his regiment easily jumped over the crevice, Cennet stopped suddenly, not out
    of any sense of fear, but rather from an inexplicable bout of fascination. Rising
    up from the deep crack in the uneven obsidian terrain was a red-hot cyclone of
    burning cinders. Far below the surface of the desolate battlefield was a churning
    torrent of molten rock. Despite the other running soldiers, distant explosions
    lighting up the horizon, and gunfire zipping past just over his head, Cennet stared
    into the scalding river of lava for several seconds, time he really didn\u2019t
    have to spare.\n\nWhen another soldier in his unit clapped him on the back as
    he passed, Cennet was roused from his trance and his attention locked back on
    target. He followed the rest of the formation to the top of a twisted rise of
    porous black rock overlooking a nightmarish scene of heavy combat taking place
    on a shifting arena of partially solidified volcanic rock. Several hundred meters
    away, he could just make out the lead ranks of the enemy force.\n\nCennet took
    up position behind a piece of the rock that jutted straight up, kneeling as he
    double-checked the clip in his assault rifle. He watched as the two soldiers immediately
    adjacent to him stood up and emptied their clips to suppress the enemy advance,
    knowing it would be his turn to stand and pick out individual targets as soon
    as their rounds were complete. He was already up when their weapons ran dry, having
    attentively counted each bullet they fired to anticipate his action.\n\nThe first
    thing he saw through the scope of his rifle was the face of an armored helmet
    looking down a barrel at him from across the field. A heartbeat later, he felt
    a sucking tightness compress his abdomen as a tungsten slug quietly entered and
    exited his body. Staggering backwards, he dropped his rifle and looked down at
    the gaping wound, the blood pouring out over his hands. As many of his companions
    looked on, some shaking their heads slowly, Cennet turned and limped away from
    the front line.\n\nWith his mind reeling from blood loss and his insides screaming
    in agony, he managed to walk for several minutes until he once again found himself
    staring down into the crevice. The promise of blissful oblivion was addicting,
    far too enticing for him to refute how much he needed it. Without a second thought,
    he leaned forward and silently tumbled down into the rolling lava."
