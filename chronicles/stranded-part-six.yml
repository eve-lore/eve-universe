    they come for me, I am alone in my room picking through a madman\u2019s conspiracy.
    Shipping manifests, eyewitness accounts, email correspondence, hacked security
    footage. All the information I\u2019d copied from the reporter\u2019s datapad.
    Data that at first seemed completely random had, in the days since, started to
    make a lot more sense. Like one of those children\u2019s puzzles, an optical illusion
    hiding a picture within a picture, the longer I stared at it all, the clearer
    everything became. The noise faded and, slowly, a pattern took shape.\n\nThe room
    fills with light. The brightness is overwhelming. Backlit by the stark, narrow-banded
    lighting in the corridor, three large shadows step through the opening door. I
    rub at my eyes. A thick, oily tear greases my face. Darkness leaks into the room,
    a roiling mass of black tar that comes bubbling through the walls, the floor,
    the ceiling. The men don\u2019t seem to notice it. They keep on coming.\n\nI try
    to blink away the liquid, and my eyelids almost stick together. I wipe at my face
    and my fingers come away black. I feel the tar ooze from my nose. I start to cough,
    hocking up thick fists of it. The darkness continues to rise, drowning the room
    in the tallow black of a thousand midnights. And through it all, they keep coming.
    The light from the doorway shrinks to a pinprick, and then everything is gone
    and I\u2019m surrounded by nothing. Not for the first time, I throw up.\n\n*\u201CDo
    you remember now, Traveller?\u201D* The voice is soft and expectant, almost pleading.\n\nFighting
    back the nausea, the smothering heat of this place. \u201CWhat are you talking
    about? I know all of this.\u201D\n\n*\u201CKnowing is not the same as remembering.\u201D*
    Disappointment in the voice now.\n\nWhy is it so hard to think? *Fuck you, fuck
    this place. I want out.* By way of response I pull my sidearm and fire into the
    dark. It barely makes a sound and I keep pulling the trigger long after I run
    out of bullets. Somehow, somewhere in the dark I hear the soft *plink* of metal.
    I move towards it.\n\n*\u201CDid you give them up willingly or did they take them
    from you?\u201D*\n\nAfter a few steps I reload, fire until I hear the sound again,
    re-orient myself, and keep moving.\n\n*\u201CYou must remember.\u201D* Anger.\n\nA
    lance of pain stabs behind my eye. The nail-scrape sensation of something fingering
    my brain drops me to my knees and, slowly, the memory puts itself back together.\n\nA
    rust-red wall appears first, followed by a table, squat and square, and then floor
    panels smeared a darker hue than the wall. Dried blood, something in me intuits.
    Pieces continue to fall into place and the room starts to take shape. But even
    before it comes together it\u2019s clear that this is not my room. Armed guards
    stand at attention around me. They wear the red and black trim and blank stares
    of special forces.\n\nAfter the room, the next thing I notice is how badly my
    jaw hurts. I touch it and pain erupts across my face. I remind myself not to do
    that again.\n\n\u201CSorry about that. But you can be a little stubborn.\u201D\n\nA
    voice behind me. Its owner leans into view. He is brown-skinned, black of hair
    and eye, with tectonic features that crack and spread awkwardly as he smiles.\n\n\u201CVantus
    Torin,\u201D I say.\n\n\u201C*General* Vantus Torin,\u201D he corrects.\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re
    a general now?\u201D\n\n\u201CAnd you\u2019re a cripple.\u201D For a Krusual,
    Vantus is unabashedly direct. He never tip-toes around the truth, which is why
    I\u2019ve always liked him.\n\nHe smiles. \u201CCome, I have something to show
    you.\u201D\n\nGlaring at the guards, wondering which one of them hit me, I guide
    the chair out into the passage and pull up alongside him. The passageway leads
    out onto an enclosed overpass, transparent sections of which give a spectacular
    view of the intra-station terminus below. Trams come and go as we walk in silence.
    Mostly, I\u2019m trying to figure out how to get out of this alive. It is Vantus
    who speaks first.\n\n\u201CAfter what happened on Khabi VIII we thought we\u2019d
    lost you. Then I read the report of the attack on the *Ingress* and knew it had
    to be you. So I sent some men to look into it.\u201D\n\nI punch the panel and
    the chair slams to a halt. Vantus steps briskly to the side to avoid tripping
    over it. \u201CYou ordered the attack? You\u2019re responsible for putting me
    in this?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes. And no. That\u201D-he points at the wheelchair-\u201Cyou
    did all by yourself. The men we hired were under strict orders not to do any unnecessary
    harm to the people on board that ship. But then you show up and damn near wipe
    out half their team. I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t kill you.\u201D\n\n*I
    wish they had.* Something shifts in the mountain of knowledge I\u2019ve built
    up over the last few days, collapsing under the weight of a hundred facts, the
    clear surface of understanding exposed beneath. \u201CYou stole your own shipment.\u201D\n\nTo
    his credit, Vantus doesn\u2019t deny it. \u201CIn a way, yes. What we took belongs
    to all Minmatar. Not just those who believe they make decisions for all of us.\u201D
    He hesitates for a moment, chooses his words carefully. \u201CThey want to hide
    it away. Study it. I want to *use* it.\u201D\n\n\u201CAnd what *is* it, exactly?\u201D\n\nHis
    dark eyes shine. \u201COur salvation.\u201D\n\n\u201CThe Republic needs an army,
    Berlin. Now more than ever. And with this we finally have the means to create
    one. An entire army of immortals. An unstoppable force.\u201D\n\nHe leans on the
    armrests of my chair, his face inches from mine. In it I see the haunted stare
    of a people, an entire nation\u2019s pain bubbling under the surface. I think
    of Neera. Eyes moist with suffering and hardship so intense that it is carried
    in the DNA of each generation. And I wonder why I don\u2019t feel the same way.\n\n\u201C*We*
    can save all of Minmatar. Us. Not Skymother. Not the Elders and their empty prophecies.
    With this we can lift our faces from the mud and shit the rest of New Eden has
    cast us down into.\u201D\n\nI finger the knife hidden in the smooth side-mould
    of the chair. *Everyone underestimates the handicapped.* I could kill him right
    here. Or take him hostage. Use him to get a ship and get the hell out of here.
    A tram zooms overhead, the muted rumble of its passing shakes the entire overpass.
    *And go where?* I\u2019m tired of having to look over my shoulder. I see Neera
    and all her dreams and hopes for our people. I let go of the knife.\n\n\u201CImmortal
    soldiers, huh?\u201D I say finally.\n\nVantus pushes off and steps back. He seems
    visibly relieved.\n\n\u201CI thought it would take more to convince you.\u201D\n\n\u201CI
    haven\u2019t said yes yet,\u201D I remind him. \u201CIf you have all of this\u201D-I
    gesture around myself-\u201Cwhat do you need me for?\u201D\n\n\u201CWe can create
    an army, but we can\u2019t manufacture experience. You\u2019re a decorated soldier,
    one of the finest I\u2019ve ever worked with.\u201D\n\n\u201C*Ex*-soldier. Last
    I checked deserters got a bullet, not a medal.\u201D\n\nVantus waves it away.
    \u201CAs far as I\u2019m concerned, Berlin Ansacre *is* dead. You no longer exist.
    But what you\u2019ve seen, what you know, what you *remember*, that will live
    on.\u201D\n\n\u201CAnd,\u201D he says it almost as an afterthought. \u201CWe can
    give you your legs back.\u201D\n\nThinking back, that was the precise moment Berlin
    Ansacre died and Balac was born."
