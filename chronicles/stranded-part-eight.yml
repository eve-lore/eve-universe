    sixteen days we fought beneath a merciless sky, slogging through mud and stench
    as rain pissed down on our heads, cold and vile and never-ending. It filled our
    packs, our clothes and our weapons. It filled our mouths. For sixteen days we
    fought, on little food and even less sleep, an enemy that was better equipped,
    better prepared and almost certainly better paid than us. And for sixteen days
    we died.\n\n\u201CDead end!\u201D Gastun shouts, his voice barely audible over
    the roar of the storm. It\u2019s our third day in the mountains, already more
    than a day behind schedule. We\u2019re tasked with securing a forward site for
    CRU deployment - clones aren\u2019t much use to anyone if they\u2019re miles away
    from the frontline - but the fighting has pushed us north, out of the burn zone
    and into the mountains.\n\nI peer over the edge. Gastun\u2019s right. Fifteen
    feet below, the narrow trail we\u2019ve been following tapers off into the rock
    face. A steady stream of rainwater rushes past our feet and over the edge. There
    is no way we\u2019re getting down that way.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019ll have to double
    back, find another way down.\u201C Gastun nods, a tightening of his jaw the only
    indication of his growing frustration. We turn and, in single file, start back
    along the path that brought us here.\n\n\u201CWhat the hell do they expect us
    to do?\u201D Krin up ahead, shouting against the storm.\n\n\u201COur job.\u201D
    Even here, now, Cala can\u2019t resist starting an argument.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019re
    outnumbered. We have no support. And now we\u2019re stuck on a mountain in the
    middle of nowhere. Don\u2019t you get it Cala? We\u2019re expendable. They don\u2019t
    give a shit what happens to us!\u201D\n\nAs we walk their argument becomes nothing
    but white noise, another layer mixed into the sound of rain and wind and thunder.
    I focus instead on our surroundings. We\u2019re exposed and vulnerable, on a path
    barely wider than a man, snaking our way through a cleave of rock sixty feet wide
    and much, *much* deeper. Walls of sheer rock leer at us from above, white and
    rain smoothed and... and that\u2019s when I see it. Bent over the edge of a cliff,
    a smudge of darkness so intense that it seems to collapse the air around it. Watching,
    motionless, untouched by the rain. The shadow stalker. The black presence that
    has followed me since Khabi VIII.\n\nCala\u2019s scream pierces the heart of the
    storm. I turn in time to see the last bit of ground give way beneath her feet
    and drop her over the edge. Krin has his back to her and is the slowest to react.
    Gastun is in the rear, too far away to do anything. That leaves only me. I jump,
    plunging my arm over the edge, and for a terrible moment feel nothing but air
    between my fingers. Then skin, fingers. I have her. I try to reach out with my
    other hand but feel the rock start to give way underneath me as I do. We\u2019re
    slipping, going over, but then Gastun and Krin are on us and together we pull
    her, heaving and swearing \u2013 she has the body of a 200-pound male after all
    \u2013 to safety.\n\n\u201CWe need to get the hell out of these mountains.\u201D\n\nIt\u2019s
    the first time I\u2019ve heard Gastun complain. In later years I would learn that
    Gastun was afraid of heights. This was as close as he ever came to showing it.\n\n\u201CI
    couldn\u2019t agree more,\u201D I reply, looking back at the spot where, moments
    before, the shadow had been.\n\nAfter that we walk in silence, water-logged and
    weary. Everything feels heavy. My body aches and every step seems to take twice
    the effort, as though the rain has soaked into my bones and is weighing me down.
    There is no joy when we arrive at a small cave; the remnants of a fire the only
    evidence that we had been here the night before. Inside, tendrils of rock cling
    to the walls in patches like the misshapen teeth of an old Sitari hag. But at
    least it\u2019s dry.\n\nExhausted, sleep comes easily, but it is not peaceful
    and when I open my eyes the shadow is staring at me, inches from my face. Beyond,
    at the cave entrance, Gastun keeps watch. *How did it get past him?* Slowly, so
    as not to draw attention, I reach for my sidearm. It opens its mouth, a wound
    that rips and stretches and closes in on itself all at once, but no sound comes
    out. Darkness oozes around the edge of my vision. My hand closes around the pistol,
    but it\u2019s too late. The darkness takes me.\n\nThere is nothing but silence.
    Silence and gut-wrenching despair. My chest aches with a grief and guilt so intense
    that I cannot breathe, cannot feel anything but sadness and fear and confusion.
    A tumbling helplessness. The pure unchained fear of a child. Then, just as quickly,
    it\u2019s gone. I feel the rain on my face and wonder how it got inside the cave.
    I realize then that I\u2019m weeping.\n\nOutside, the deep gray of what should
    be night is starting to give way to the lighter gray of day, and still it rains.
    We\u2019ve seen neither sun nor night since we got here.\n\nGastun appears at
    the entrance to the cave. \u201CI\u2019ve found us a way out of here!\u201D Buoyed
    by the thought of getting off this mountain, the rest of us follow.\n\nHe can\u2019t
    keep the smile off his face as he points it out. A ridge, no more than a foot
    across, cut so close to the face of the mountain that we\u2019d have to hug the
    wall and inch our way across.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s no wonder we never spotted it
    the first time.\u201D\n\nIt\u2019s a dizzying view, one with barely enough space
    to stand. Slip and you\u2019d fall. Lean back even slightly and you\u2019d fall.
    I can\u2019t help but stare at the broken talus slope below. It would not be a
    pleasant death.\n\n\u201CIt widens out further ahead.\u201D Gastun anticipating
    what, by the looks on our faces, we were all thinking.\n\n\u201CHow do you know?\u201D
    says Krin. It sounds more like an accusation than a question.\n\n\u201CBecause
    I\u2019ve already done it, it\u2019s not that hard.\u201D But something in his
    face tells me that\u2019s not the whole truth.\n\n\u201CAre you insane!\u201D
    Krin says, already backing away. \u201CThere\u2019s got to be another way down
    into that valley.\u201D\n\n\u201CI\u2019m with Krin on this one.\u201D We all
    look at Cala, but no-one seems more surprised than Krin. I guess there\u2019s
    a first time for everything.\n\n\u201CLook on the bright side,\u201D I say. \u201CIf
    we fall, we get to hike all the way back out here and try it again.\u201D\n\n<div
    align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nIt takes most of the
    day, but we make it down. After we had struggled and twisted our way along the
    outer rim, we wound our way down through the scree, eventually coming out onto
    the wide, flat plain that we could always see, but until now could never reach.\n\n\u201CNowhere
    to run, nowhere to hide. If we\u2019re attacked out here, we\u2019re as good as
    dead.\u201D Gastun observes.\n\n\u201CThen we\u2019d better get to work,\u201D
    I reply.\n\nThe ECCM tower takes longer to put together than I\u2019d hoped. Without
    the mountain to block it, the wind is stronger down here. It tugs at cables, and
    drags tools underfoot, and if you\u2019re not careful a sudden gust of it will
    knock you off your feet. It pushes and pulls like a petulant child desperate for
    attention while the rain lashes at our backs. With the tower online we\u2019d
    be able to punch through the interference blanket that covers the area, giving
    us a foothold in the region and the support we need.\n\n\u201CHow much longer,
    Cala?\u201D\n\nThe enemy appears then as though conjured into life by my words.
    They come in numbers we hadn\u2019t anticipated, in tanks and on foot. They aren\u2019t
    immortals, but they don\u2019t have to be. They\u2019re an *army.*\n\n\u201CWe\u2019ll
    hold them off,\u201D I say, but we all know how this will go down. It\u2019s over
    faster than I\u2019d hoped. The shells destroy the ECCM tower and scatter us.
    They advance in long columns, walking and firing like some automaton army. We
    cut down those that get too close, but there are too many of them. Before long,
    I\u2019m all that\u2019s left.\n\nAnd through it all, the shadow figure walks
    unharmed. Bullets pass harmlessly through it before striking and killing someone
    on the other side. Smoke seems to move around it, the wind doesn\u2019t get near
    it.\n\nIt stops some distance in front of me, oblivious of or unconcerned about
    the battle being waged around, and at times, through it. It opens its mouth, and
    this time I hear it. The voice that at this exact moment has me trapped below
    the earth\u2019s surface. The voice that has forced me through one memory after
    another. The voice and the shadow that are one and the same.\n\n*\u201CThey lied
    to you, Traveller. Are still lying to you. In the worst way possible.\u201D*\n\nSuddenly,
    I\u2019m standing outside of it all, untouched by the rain and the fighting. I
    look back at the memory of me lying in a pool of my own blood, at the soldiers
    advancing. Minmatar soldiers; my own people. At the empty husks that once housed
    Cala and Krin and Gastun.\n\n*\u201CCome, I will show you what really happened
    this day.\u201D*\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;line-height:172.5%;font-style:italic;margin:
