    hate space. Even the word is a misnomer. There\u2019s nothing vast or open about
    it. Two years on board this ship and it\u2019s still all I think about. I feel
    it pressing against the hull, cold and heavy. Hear it in the thousand creaks and
    moans of the *Ingress* as she pushes deeper into the smothering black.\n\nThe
    corridors on the way back to my compartment are empty, but elsewhere on the ship
    people are busily going about their work. There is no room for passengers on board
    a Thukker caravan. Everybody contributes. Outsiders, as I\u2019ve come to learn,
    doubly so.\n\nFatigue hangs over me like a lead jacket. But even tired, I know
    when I\u2019m being followed. I glance back. Nothing. During the downshift cycle
    the strip lighting in the corridors is turned low. Good for saving power, great
    for sneaking up on someone. I keep walking. The day Neera died - *The day you
    killed her* \u2013 I left. When I was done mourning, I stood up, walked outside
    and just kept going. I guess I always knew someone would come for me.\n\nAs I
    walk, the fatigue burns away, replaced with the savage anticipation of the fight
    to come. I round a corner, then immediately turn and step back into the corridor
    just in time to see a silky shadow disappear into the darkness of a small maintenance
    alcove. A shiver of familiarity crawls up my spine. *Run.* Something uneasy in
    the movement. Fear scratches at the back of my mind, frantic as a caged animal.
    *Run.* The shadow moves again, and this time the oil-slick motion triggers a star
    burst of understanding. The lab on Khabi VIII. The fight flushes out of me. *RUN!*
    I turn to run just as the heat of the explosion surrounds me. Scorching tongues
    of it licking my face and then gone, sucked out of the gaping hole in the corridor
    wall into the suffocating emptiness. And me along with it.\n\n<div align=\"center\"
    style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nI wake in darkness. Gasping for air.
    Sucking in hungry mouthfuls that hammer spikes of pain through my brain. Lights
    spasm and arc across my vision. Dizzy. I reach out a hand to steady myself, but
    only succeed in falling over. I throw up. I lie there for a moment, floating in
    the center of my own spinning universe. Slowly, in the faraway galaxy of my mind,
    nebulous recognition forms. The spinning slows and confusion coalesces into anger.\n\n\u201CWhat
    the hell did you do?\u201D I scream the words, but they wither in the darkness
    and barely reach my own ears. I try to stand, but the spinning starts again and
    so I lie back down. \u201CThat\u2019s not how it happened!\u201D I yell. Again,
    the darkness swallows the sound of my voice.\n\nI feel numb. Every part of me
    heavy and slow, like being underwater. My mind slams into my skull as though it\u2019s
    had enough of all this and wants out. I want to die. Instead, I focus on the ground.
    The ground is solid. The ground is real. Need to keep moving. But where? *Forward,
    chintaku. People should always move forward.* Even in my head, the sound of her
    voice is enough to make me cry. I start walking.\n\nThe darkness pushes against
    me. I lean into it. I\u2019ve fought in heavy gravity before, but never felt anything
    like this. It tugs at my arms and leg. Clings to my ankle like a desperate lover.
    I walk for hours *(Days? Minutes?)*, but each step feels no closer or farther
    than the first.\n*\n\u201CWell, you would know, Traveler. They are your memories
    after all.\u201D*\n\nI bow my head into the invisible storm and press forward.\n\n*\u201CYou
    can\u2019t outrun them you know. Not forever.\u201D*\n\nThe darkness rises. A
    wave of shimmering heat and pressure, the tide of it carries me back to the ship
    and the fire and the screams.\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nThe
    corridor is just the way I remember it. Burning, but intact. Up ahead, a woman
    runs past, a cloak of flame billowing behind her. She doesn\u2019t scream. As
    the fire swallows her, she simply hunches closer over the small bundle she\u2019s
    carrying in her arms. I turn away from the sight. There are some things even I
    don\u2019t want to see. Thukker caravans carry entire generations on board. Families
    live and die without ever leaving the ship. But most live longer than this.\n\nAn
    arm reaches out of a darkened doorway and pulls me inside. The door\u2019s still
    sliding shut as I reach around and twist the wrist on my shoulder, and in one
    smooth motion pinion my attacker\u2019s arm and slam him into the wall.\n\n\u201CHey!
    No, wait!\u201D\n\nHe tries to turn around, but I apply more pressure and he grunts
    in pain.\n\nIt\u2019s me! Jet!\u201D\n\nJita. Calls himself Jet. I remember now.
    Strong kid. Worked a couple shifts down in the Skews together. His parents named
    him after the system he was conceived in. Parents can do shitty things to their
    children sometimes.\n\nI let go.\n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s going on?\u201D\n\nHe squeezes
    his shoulder. \u201CYou almost broke my arm!\u201D\n\n\u201CYou\u2019ll live.\u201D
    I say, knowing I\u2019ve hurt his pride more than his arm.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019ve
    been boarded.\u201D He says, finally. \u201CI was running a diagnostic suite when
    the entire board lit up. They blew a hole into the maintenance bay on Deck 4.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat!
    Who?\u201D I imagine Valklears storming through the corridors. If this is my fault...
    If I brought this on these people... I shut the thought down before it can go
    any further.\n\n\u201CDoes it matter?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes!\u201D I say a little
    too loudly. \u201CYes it does.\u201D\n\n\u201CWell, sorry, but I didn\u2019t stop
    to ask. Vartigin says he heard you were a soldier before. Is that true?\u201D\n\nI
    ignore the question. \u201CHow many of them?\u201D\n\n\u201CI don\u2019t know.
    Maybe ten?\u201D Still rubbing his arm.\n\n\u201CFor a ship this size? They\u2019ll
    need a lot more. And I\u2019m going to need a weapon.\u201D\n\nJet walks across
    the room, does something with a panel that I can\u2019t quite make out and comes
    back holding what might as well be a rock for all the good it\u2019ll do me. A
    Gistii-10. Small, compact and horribly inaccurate at range.\n\n\u201CWhere did
    you get that?\u201D\n\nHe shrugs. \u201CThis isn\u2019t the first time something
    like this has happened.\u201D\n\n\u201CStay here.\u201D I say, and snatch the
    weapon from him before he can object.\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:2.625em\">***</div>\n\nI
    count sixteen. They\u2019re armed and efficient - in ten minutes the entire sub-section
    is locked down - but they\u2019re not Valklear. Dressed head-to-toe in black.
    No insignias or markings of any kind. Whoever they work for, they don\u2019t like
    to advertise. Everything about them is low-key. Everything except the weapons
    they\u2019re carrying. Shiny, hi-tech. I look at the aging Gistii in my hand.
    With no better option, I wait.\n\nEventually, they split up. I watch as the larger
    group disappears around the corner, give it a few minutes just to be sure and
    then, with a silent thanks to whichever miser son of a bitch insisted on the low
    lighting protocol, move round the corner in a bent-knee run, closing as much of
    the gap as I can.\n\nTwelve meters out someone sees me, but three shots center-mass
    puts him down before the others even turn. I get one more shot off, tagging one
    of them in the ribs, before the shouting erupts and the shooting starts. The corridor
    boils with the hungry hiss of gunfire. A wild spray of shots. The sick sizzle
    of metal to my left. I ignore all of it, focus instead on the nearest target.
    The Gistii jerks in my hands. Once. Twice. And then he\u2019s falling back, grabbing
    at the wall, collapsing. One of them is screaming into his headset, but as the
    others go down he pulls a rifle and rakes it across the corridor. The stutter-whine
    of impacts all around me, metal shards sting my face and arms. I blink something
    warm and wet from my eyes. *Focus.* I get the Gistii back on target and empty
    the clip. He jolts, staggers, still firing wildly, and then is down on the ground,
    bleeding over his friends.\n\nIf they didn\u2019t know I was here before, they
    do now. *Shit, the whole ship must have heard that.* I need a new weapon. I need
    to find cover. I know what I should be doing, but instead I\u2019m screaming into
    the face of the only raider I can find alive.  \n\n\u201CWho sent you?\u201D\n\n\u201CDamnit!
    I said tell me who se\u2014\u201C\n\nSomething slams into me from behind and a
    warm wetness blossoms across my chest. I sink to my knees.\n\nA voice, from what
    seems far away, \u201CHow did this Thukker trash get in here? Fuck. Look at this
    mess.\u201D \n\nLying on my back, looking up at the ceiling, the corridor seems
    suddenly very bright. \u201CI won\u2019t let you take me.\u201D I try to say,
    but my tongue feels too thick for my mouth and it comes out like a groan.\n\nThe
    voice looks down at me, weapon still in hand. \u201CThere\u2019s always one isn\u2019t
    there? Way to go, hero.\u201D Then he turns back to his men.\n\n\u201CC\u2019mon.
    Get that container on board and let\u2019s get the hell out of here. G\u2019dammit!
    Be careful. He wants it undamaged.\u201D\n\nI watch them leave through the makeshift
    hole in the wall.\n\nOut into the crushing dark."
