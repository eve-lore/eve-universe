    [August 12, YC 111]\n\n  \n\n\"Director, there\u2018s a message for you.\"\n\n
    \"Little busy right now, Gerard. Can it wait?\"\n\n \"Sorry, sir. It's the Office
    One response.\"\n\n For the first time that morning, Mentas Blaque took his eyes
    off the week\u2018s insurgent update. He pushed his chair away from the console,
    stood up.\n\n\"Display, commandant.\" \n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n \n\nDIRECTOR MENTAS
    BLAQUE,\n\nFEDERAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICE\n\n \n\nExecutive Order 81042 \u2013 Consolidation
    of National Armament Assets\n\n YC111.08.12\n\n                The involvement
    of Federal Government employees as contributing representatives in the national
    arms industry has been deemed essential to achieving the objectives mandated by
    military leadership. It is in the interests of the nation at large that the best
    minds of the field act as one, and that private institutions shall find their
    favor in serving public interest.\n\nBy the authority vested in me as President
    of the Federated Union of Gallente Prime, and in order to establish a Council
    of Armaments Advisors working under Federation auspices, it is hereby ordered:\n\n
    \n\nSection 1. The Federal Council of Armaments Advisors. (a) Membership. There
    is established the Federal Council of Armaments Advisors (\"Council\"). The Council
    shall comprise the following members appointed by the President:\n\n\"End,\" said
    Blaque. He rubbed his eyes and sat back down.\n\nA few seconds passed, just him
    alone with himself in that quiet chamber. Then he pushed a button and said: \"Corporal
    Ormonde, get your men ready to roll out.\"\n\n \n\n[August 13, YC 111]\n\n \n\n\"Sir,
    I don\u2018t know. They\u2018re knocking now, but we don\u2018t see anything.
    There\u2018s no response at all.\"\n\n\"Continue for five then report,\" came
    the squawk through the radio. Corporal Argus Ormonde  flipped down his visor and
    took a few steps toward the gigantic marble sculpture beyond which, several yards
    in the distance, he could see the entrance to the cordoned-off section where this
    eccentric freak of an arms dealer was keeping himself. \n\n\"Nothing still,\"
    came Fregal\u2018s voice. \"I\u2018m listening to the knocks sound off into the
    far passage, but the echoloc\u2018s giving a weird picture. It doesn\u2018t even
    sound like there are walls in there.\"\n\nDespite himself, Ormonde sighed. \"Fine,\"
    he said. \"Initiate breach protocol alpha three and wait for my go-ahead.\"\n\nBad
    PR, but whatever. If you\u2018re batshit crazy for no better reason than that
    you have a lot of money, and you want to do things the hard way, then it\u2018s
    your batshit crazy prerogative to get roughed up a little.\n\nHe braced himself
    behind a pillar, gave the standby signal to the flank unit, then flicked the go
    switch on Fregal. To the Director he sent one signal: operation green.\n\n***\n\nIn
    the insulated comfort of his command center, Mentas Blaque felt an involuntary
    shudder of premonition. Two seconds later, there was a deafening crackle. Voices,
    a rumble. Purposeful running \n\nThe Black Eagles, getting things done when no-one
    else possibly could. It always gave him a small thrill, but today he was having
    trouble mustering the excitement. He\u2018d had a diffuse melange of bad dreams
    the night before, and ever since the morning had carried with him a nagging sensation
    of somehow being outdone.\n\n\"In position,\" said Sergeant Fregal. \"All right,
    we got two sentries and a few scout minis. Two, four, interceptor la\u2014\"\n\nThere
    was a crack. Sergeant Fregal stopped talking.\n\nNext through the radio was a
    cacophony of static-infused noise. Some of it sounded like screaming, some of
    it sounded like talking.\n\nBlaque leaned forward.\n\n \"Corporal Ormonde?\"\n\nThere
    was no reply. The noises on the radio had died down to near silence. It began
    to dawn on him that nothing like this had ever happened to his men before.\n\nHe
    cut to Control. \"Get me Jacus Roden on a private line,\" he said, \"and do it
    absolutely right this instant.\"\n\n***\n\nIt wasn\u2018t quite who he\u2018d
    been expecting. Faced with a man who had made possible, through his ingenuity
    and business wits, the destruction of untold countless millions of lives and livelihoods,
    he now realized he\u2018d subconsciously hoped for a somewhat more forceful figure.
    Jacus Roden was a slight man, perhaps five foot seven, about sixty years in appearance,
    with a slow deliberate manner and a perfectly hairless head.\n\n\"Hello, Mister
    Blaque.\" The old man was calm, quiet, rather composed given the situation.\n\n\"Mister
    Roden,\" said Blaque pleasantly. \"Would you be interested in explaining why it
    is that I\u2018ve lost contact with some of my best men after they initiatied
    their attempt \u2013 their lawful attempt, I might add \u2013 at communicating
    with you on behalf of the Gallente Federation?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Roden.
    He scratched his nose and pressed a small button on his desk. \"Their equipment
    malfunctioned within our electromagnetic field, but they\u2018re being taken good
    care of. You\u2018ll see them again safe and sound shortly.\"\n\nInwardly Mentas
    balked at the man\u2018s presumption, but he kept his demeanor carefully ironclad.
    \"I\u2018m fully presuming, then, that this courteous treatment of our troops,\"
    he said, \"is a sign that you\u2018re taking our initiative in the spirit expected
    of a loyal citizen of the Federation. Am I correct in this, Mister Roden? \n\nThe
    old man sat down in his chair, pushed a few more buttons on his desk and smiled
    airily up at the camera, without really looking at it.\n\n\"You are correct in
    that I am a loyal citizen of the Federation,\" he said.\n\n\"And what would make
    you think this constitutes acceptable treatment of Office One emissaries?\"\n\n\"I
    am motivated by nothing but love for these fine men.\"\n\n\"So you subdue them
    as a first course measure? Why not just talk?\"\n\n\"Because they haven't heard
    what I'm offering and they didn't come with the intent to listen.\"\n\nTwo seconds
    passed. Mentas Blaque breathed in, then out, then in.\n\n\"And what is it that
    you're offering, exactly?\"\n\n\"I just want what's best for everyone, Mister
    Blaque,\" the old man said. He spun in his chair and stood up. As he did so, for
    one second a metallic jaw line came into view, a streak of iron that ran from
    the side of his neck along the jaw to the bottom of the chin. \"I just want everyone
    to be able to handle their business in a manner that befits our great Federation.
    As we were proceeding until our good president decided to stifle the wings of
    creative enterprise.\" He stopped at the corner of his desk and faced the camera
    squarely. A wry curve, half a smile and yet not, played at the corner of his lips.
    \n\nMentas Blaque raised his chin almost imperceptibly and executed a well-practiced
    flare of the nostrils. \"The President makes whatever decisions are necessary
    at any given time,\" he said. \"It has been deemed that the new arrangement will
    lead to a stronger and more unified Gallente, and it's neither your place nor
    mine to question its value. It has not been idly arrived at.\"\n\n\"'Hierarchy
    is the grand streak in the human painting,'\" said Roden. \"Who was that? Fouel?
    Geremande? One of our greats, at any rate.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you can find out later,
    Mister Roden,\" said Blaque. \"After you've released our men and submitted to
    whatever punishment the courts will see fit to bestow for your transgression.\"
    His patience was beginning to chafe away. This was supposed to be an eccentric
    lunatic, not a well-spoken intellectual. Somehow the high ground had begun to
    rattle.\n\n\"Enterprise is the foundation of our great experiment, here, wouldn\u2018t
    you say?\" asked Roden, standing stock still behind his desk. Across several constellations
    and millions of kilometers, Blaque fancied he saw the tiniest flicker of light
    appear in the old man\u2018s eyes.\n\n\"Enterprise is where our Federation has
    been forged. It is where we find out how we stand. It is where we realize what
    it takes to win, to crush our competitors.\" The old man smiled pleasantly.\n\n\"If
    you start undermining the foundations of an enterprise,\u201C he continued, his
    back straightening and his gait becoming more forceful as he began a slow circle
    round his desk, \"the rest of it will all come down. And the Federation,\" he
    said, velvetine menace creeping into his voice, \"is not a lightweight enterprise.
    It is not something one crawls out from under.\"\n\n\"What,\" Blaque began, then
    stopped. It was all getting to be a bit too much. Most likely the old man was
    simply driven to folly by years of wretched excess, but there was a certain sort
    of humor in his manner, a meta-awareness that hinted at hidden knowledge.\n\nJust
    as Mentas Blaque was beginning for one of the very few times in his life to feel
    the befuddled beginnings of true admiration, the old man said, \"I think you may
    have a message.\" He sat down in his chair and leaned back.\n\nMentas muted the
    audio, checked the incoming feeds. Incident reports from seven different locations.
    Shutdown in Elore, hostage situation in Carirgnottin. Allotek Industries and Duvolle
    Labs incommunicado, CreoDron and Chemal Tech declaring allegiance with Roden Shipyards
    and sending out press releases publicly rebuffing the nationalization.\n\nNo way.
    No way you could do this, old man. Mentas cut the vidlink and got up from his
    chair. His practiced and capable mind struggled to assess the situation. Somehow
    a single purveyor of weapons tech had managed to bring the entire military-industrial
    complex together against a presidential decree. Obviously prior information, obviously
    planned well in advance, and yet  completely ridiculous in its scope and audacity.
    \n\nA full minute passed, during which the silent chamber's only sounds were the
    hum and bleep of dutiful machinery. Halfway wishing he had some way of commemorating
    the occasion, he sat down once more in the still deadness of his control center
    and fixed his eyes on the screen in front of him.\n\nInto his microphone he quietly
    subvocalized, \"Control, recorder off.\"\n\nHe switched back to Roden, unmuted
    the open channel. The old man was sitting in his chair, fingers splayed across
    his lap. The wry curve, by now, was more than a half-smile.\n\n\"Mister Roden,\"
    said Mentas Blaque. \"It looks like you and I need to talk.\"\n"
