    may not make sense at first. The complexities of life's story run so deep that
    it may take some time to understand. Some time indeed. Yet I tell you now that
    time will make the truth of these words shine ever brighter, because that is what
    I made them to do.\n\n\\- Unknown\n\n***\n\nShe was watching the people of Seyllin
    die on live holovision when they came for her.\n\nLianda. I must warn you, my
    child, no matter the risk. The Senate has learned of the appearance of new, stable
    wormholes, leading to unknown areas of space. You must not involve yourself in
    this matter. There will be a time and a place for your research to continue. Please,
    for the sake of everything you have worked for, lie low.\n\nThey told her CreoDron
    had only asked for one person. On the display, a darkened and burning orb glowed
    in brilliant shades of blue. Millions must have been there, she thought, trapped
    inside a dying planet.\n\nThey said this was the kind of help that would matter
    more tomorrow, when today had taken what it would from them all. Strangely poetic,
    the ones they had decided to send for her. Most likely no coincidence. They left
    her there. She would follow soon, once her affairs had been set in order. Those
    words, and the truth of them in her eyes when she stepped towards them so purposefully,\n\nThey
    had bought the privacy she would need to reach him.\n\n***\n\n\"CD-73, this is
    CD-Vitrauze, come in.\"\n\n\"CD-Vitrauze, this is CD-73, I have you.\"\n\n\"How
    are you doing out there?\"\n\n\"Fine, just settling in.\"\n\n\"Professor? What
    you said before? We're behind you all the way.\"\n\nA poignant smile formed across
    her face, shared only with the on-board surveillance.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nThe
    Helios stabilized as it pulled out of warp, settling for now into a cautious eighty-kilometer
    orbit. The gamble had paid off. Not that she had doubted her initial findings.
    She felt it was somehow appropriate that Vitrauze was where she found it. She
    had not signaled anything to them, not yet, not until she could see something.\n\nSomething
    amazing.\n\nThe system of Vitrauze, to most people, had been nothing more than
    another cruel and lonely place off the major spacelanes of the Federation. For
    most people, it would remain such. That was fine with her. The best secrets had
    always lain in plain sight, beneath casual glances that each day saw nothing.\n\nShe
    saw them, though. Stripping the unknown of its mystery had been her life's work,
    a task as noble as it was destructive. Before her now, just a few short moments
    away, was one more riddle, but it wasn't one she would solve to the end. She gazed
    out into the twisting shapes, admiring something she felt she had seen a thousand
    times before in her dreams and yet only now truly saw for the first time. It was
    as magnificent and terrifying as anything she could have hoped for.\n\nFor those
    there now, Vitrauze would be remembered as the system where they found that first
    link to the unknown. For her, it would be where she left something. She would
    burn, glow like Seyllin, and in that dim luminescence that her sacrifice shed,
    others would see the hidden paths to tread. He would have liked it phrased that
    way.\n\n\"Vitrauze, I've found something. Sensors onlined, in transit now. You
    have live priority feed.\"\n\nThe microwarpdrive engaged and eighty kilometers
    quickly became fifty, thirty, twenty and then, nothing. Zero point.\n\nIt had
    been named after an early Federation Senator, whose name in turn was supposedly
    taken from one of the first settlers to come through the EVE Gate. To the Amarr,
    \"Vitra\" meant simply \"life.\" Life itself. The Gallentean understanding of
    the word was more subtle, however. To them it meant \"living.\"\n\nDifferent in
    the way sunrise and sunset are, she thought.\n\nSix more Helioses decloaked as
    they dropped out of warp, falling into the same cautious long-range orbit as she
    had.\n\n\"Whenever you're ready.\"\n\n***\n\n\"CD-73, this is CD-Vitrauze, come
    in.\"\n\nShe stopped the thrusters for a moment, almost answering the call before
    deciding against it. They could wait. Even though her voice alone would mean so
    much, they could wait. For now, this moment was hers.\n\n\"CD-73, this is CD-Vitrauze,
    come in. Problem at our end.\"\n\nThe blood immediately started pushing through
    her veins, accelerating with each new heartbeat. She fought back the instinct,
    millions of years and even more souls forfeited in the name of progress, all driving
    her to avoid this. To return.\n\n\"CD-Vitrauze, this is CD-73, I have you.\"\n\n\"Black
    Eagles have entered system, maximum time until location is scanned: approximately
    2 minutes.\"\n\n\"Proceed as planned. I am not here.\"\n\nWithin just a few moments
    of those words reaching the other side, the flagship of CreoDron's private fleet
    deactivated cloaking devices and began about the crucial task of pretending to
    be useful.\n\n***\n\nTo most observers, \"CD-1\" would be considered a monstrosity.
    Horrifically warped Dominix hulls overflowing with esoteric electronics equipment
    often evoked familiar images, ones not so welcome in the heart of Federation space,
    particularly in recent years, and particularly when the vessel in question carried
    CreoDron tags.\n\nTo many of the leading scientists in CreoDron, though, it was
    their beloved \"mothership.\" At times it would serve as their mobile research
    lab, as their home. Now it served as one incredibly risky decoy. Confiscation
    would mean an end to so many ongoing projects, but the weight of that also played
    in their favor.\n\nThe uncharacteristically dark hulls of four Megathron-class
    battleships suddenly appeared, sliding into the scene with a graceful menace that
    only the Black Eagles, with their specially commissioned ships, could project.
    Even before the violent tear in the fabric of space that dominated the area, gushing
    with its ominous crimson light, their presence was made known. The arrival alone
    would have its effect, but underneath it all, the official CreoDron line from
    that point on would remain steadfast. All contact with the other side had been
    lost.\n\nDuvolle scientists had been \"invited\" to attend the ensuing investigation
    and it was they in particular who queried the absence of CreoDron's leading astrophysicist.
    No doubt their own interest in these matters was welcomed by the Eagles, just
    as Duvolle had welcomed the opportunity to see and hear things that would normally
    put their own operations under the Federation's ruthless self-scrutiny. These
    were the sorts of plays the Eagles were fast becoming known for, where saying
    no was made a twice-unattractive option.\n\nThe captain of the fleet understood
    better than most the capacities of his opponent. He would comply, but even though
    others made billions of ISK, these two outsiders now prying into their research
    would be considered by him and the rest of his crew as the very worst kind of
    vultures. This was how real, lasting damage was done. No press releases, no fanfare,
    no public comments one way or the other. Nothing would be made today but enemies.\n\nAs
    CD-1 was turned over indefinitely to Federal jurisdiction, the first discovery
    was made. In one ear, the pilots and crew of CreoDron were hearing stories of
    a new, unknown civilization and in the other, the mechanical drawl of a Federation
    police drone reading them their rights.\n\nNormally, such a task was paid its
    respect, and even the most severe of the Eagle's captains would dutifully inform
    a fellow citizen of their legal rights. As both parties floated there, however
    \u2013 the once-honored formalities of the moment handled by automatons \u2013
    the Eagles received their own distracting news. Another nineteen wormholes had
    been discovered, and although that amount by itself was easily matched, what disconcerted
    the captains most was that only five minutes before their arrival, the number
    had stood at one.\n\n***\n\nThe Helios rested up against the structure. The enclave
    in the distance seemed quiet, bereft of life. This one, however, felt young even
    now. There was such beauty in this timeless design, even though time had claimed
    them all.\n\nIt was more real this time. He looked more real, but she could see
    it. See that he was not, and that perhaps, this was not either. The data could
    have been pulled from the fluid router cache, enhanced somehow. Any automated
    system that could do something like this would be far more advanced than she had
    known, but then this was not her field, and she had a saying about scientists
    who casually dipped into her own. All the same, she could swear she knew the design.
    So old. She had these thoughts even as she stared at him. Too much a scientist
    and too little a soldier.\n\nThis time, there was no life in Hilen's eyes, and
    it was telling her to go.\n\nOnce again into the darkness, and for a moment she
    could almost feel that wind on her face, as the data that represented who she
    was failed to cross the river back home.\n\n***\n\n\"We have reports of\u202678
    now. 78, Corporal. I just had a scout land in\u2026 in\u2026\"\n\n\"What is it,
    Captain?\"\n\n\"\u2026in Luminaire, Sir.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"An advance scout,
    deployed\u2026 deployed in Lonetrek. They reported the wormhole in Ibura, scouted
    the other side and landed in the middle of our operations base.\"\n\n***\n\nLianda
    watched the leaves falling into the stream, plucked from the limbs of the trees
    with such ease. The wind was so gentle she could barely feel it on her face and
    yet it took them all, softly caressing the branches into donating the remnants
    of life they once bore.\n\nShe could understand that eagerness, how easy it was
    to let go after you'd grown out of the things that once nurtured you, that once
    comprised your entire world.\n\nHe understood this, of course. This was his VR
    channel, and he had chosen the environment for a reason.\n\n\"Hilen,\" she said
    quietly, looking across to the Deteis. His eyes were fixed on the currents that
    licked at the edge of the bank. A sobering gaze slowly lifted to meet hers. The
    weight of everything they had shared was staring her in the face. She fell silent.\n\n\"Go,\"
    he said, turning away from her and shaking his head. \"Just\u2026\"\n\nHe disconnected
    the feed, leaving her alone in the surrounding black.\n\n***\n\n\"Her unique network
    ID was accessed at the same time she attempted to make contact, yet she did not
    enter her password correctly.\"\n\n\"Yes, we looked into it. She didn't gain any
    access to secure information. We're investigating the reasons she didn't authenticate
    properly.\"\n\n\"Of course, but that's not what I wanted to mention.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"You
    don't seem to know what I'm talking about.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"The password,
    the one she entered. The incorrect string?\"\n\n\"I will put aside any questions
    I have about how you would have access to such a thing and ask you to come to
    the point.\"\n\n\"It's a locus.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"We were not aware.\"\n\n\"With
    due respect, Sir, what you are not aware of is that for every one of those six
    Helioses inside your system, there are two of our Buzzards.\"\n\n\"I believe that
    as much as I believe you're a psychologist.\"\n\n***\n\nApplied Science? All science
    is applied. Eventually.\n\n\\- Hilen Tukoss. Program Director, Otosela Neuropsychology
