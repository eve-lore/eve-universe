    Laitanen and Korako Kosakami, today better known by the nicknames they gave themselves:
    Fatal and the Rabbit, began their careers as promising space ship captains in
    the 37th (Octopus) Squadron of the Caldari Navy. Laitanen was a shrewd and gifted
    captain, with a glib tongue and charismatic smile. Many expected him to reach
    a position of authority in the end. But he was also vain and greedy; traits that
    led to his eventual desertion. Kosakami was much more introvert than his friend
    Laitanen, but he had a brilliant mind and was a technical wizard.\n\nWhen, in
    the space of one week, Laitanen was passed over for promotion and Kosakami was
    blamed for a lethal crash landing, the two friends decided to desert. They stole
    a couple of Condor-class frigates, the same they still use today, and set off
    to a pirate-infested sector between Caldari and Gallente space. This took place
    in YC 86.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for them to establish themselves among the
    criminal society and few months after their arrival they\u2019d set up their own
    criminal organization, called the Guristas, which is an amalgamation of two Caldari
    words meaning \u2018naughty people\u2019 and is also a slang term for \u2018gang\u2019.\n\nThe
    Guristas are famous for their raids into civilized territory, something that very
    few pirate clans are willing or able to do. The mission of these raids is most
    often simply to steal cargo or passengers (for ransom) from freighters, but on
    numerous occasions their main intention seems to be to sabotage empire installations
    (mining facilities, sentry guns, and the like). This has led to speculations that
    some unscrupulous empire companies or even governments are hiring the Guristas
    to take out property of the competition.\n\nBut by far the most celebrated of
    the Gurista raids was when they kidnapped the Gallentean ambassador to the Caldari
    State and received an enormous ransom from his family. The kidnapping itself was
    a brilliant feat and clearly demonstrated that Fatal and the Rabbit were far from
    being the stereotypical brainless brats that most people regarded pirates to be.\n\nAmbassador
    Luecin Rileau, son of the diamond-king Darouen Rileau, had only one noticeable
    vice, and that was gambling. His gambling fascination was probably the main reason
    why he had sought to become the Gallentean ambassador to the Caldari State, a
    notoriously tricky position. Ambassador Rileau frequented the Grand Tiegjon Casino
    in the Echelon Entertainment Studio station in the Caldari system of Vellaine.
    It was there that Fatal and the Rabbit struck.\n\nThe two of them docked at the
    station under in disguise. The Rabbit (Kosakami) stayed behind in the ship while
    Fatal (Laitanen) entered the casino. Fatal involved himself in a game of Pettokori,
    a popular electro-board gambling game, which Rileau was participating in. In the
    course of the game, Fatal deliberately lost money to the ambassador and finally,
    when he\u2019d run out of money, Fatal offered his ship to the ambassador. The
    ambassador accepted and proceeded to win the game. Fatal offered to show the ambassador
    his newly won ship and Rileau, accompanied by several bulky bodyguards, accepted.\n\nBut
    while the game was underway the Rabbit had been busy. He rigged the boarding ramp
    to the ship with tanks filled with sleeping gas. Needless to say, when the ambassador
    and his bodyguards entered the boarding ramp, they were promptly put to sleep.
    Ambassador Rileau was then carried into the ship and Fatal and the Rabbit innocently
    left the station. It was only when another ship docked in the same berth an hour
    later and discovered the boarding ramp full of snoring bodyguards that the alarm
    was raised, but by then the kidnappers were long gone.\n\nThe Gallente Federation
    was unable to apprehend the culprits and in the end the ambassador\u2019s family
    paid a huge ransom in uncut diamonds to the Guristas. All this drama received
    a great deal of media attention and even if Fatal and the Rabbit relished the
    attention for a time, in the end it only hampered them. Being the most notorious
    criminal in the world of EVE has a downside, mainly that traveling around is not
    as easy as it used to be. This has forced the Guristas to lay low for the past
    few months.\n"
