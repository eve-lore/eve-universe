    Arramida scrutinized the ship that lay motionless \u2013 lifeless \u2013 few kilometers
    away. It was a luxury yacht, made by the Viziam company. An old version; popular
    half a century ago. The numerous pockmarks on the hull and general metal wear
    indicated this ship had been floating here for as long. It was also immediately
    apparent that the yacht had not stopped here to allow the passengers to marvel
    at the view; deep scars not born by erosion crisscrossed the hull and the view
    here in deep space was far from spectacular. In fact, so far was the ship from
    any settlements or stellar objects that locating it without knowing its exact
    coordinates would be like searching for a grain of sand at the bottom of a worldwide
    ocean. But Arramida had the exact coordinates. His benefactor had given them to
    him.\n\nNot knowing who his benefactor was still irked Arramida to no end. He
    only knew his first name, Norid, and that he was an Amarrian like himself. Other
    than that, nothing. A few months earlier Norid had approached him through underground
    channels. The job offer was simple \u2013 travel to certain coordinates in the
    Rethan system and retrieve all bodies from a derelict ship there. Then he was
    to take the bodies to a specific cloning facility on Rethan V and dump them there.
    That was all. No explanations. But for the amount of hard cash Norid offered,
    explanations became trivial.\n\nArramida\u2019s sensors indicated life-signs aboard
    the ship. Further scans revealed a total of 15 people \u2013 still lost in cryo-sleep
    after all this time. Arramida had to wonder who had attacked the ship all this
    time ago and why this same attacker hadn\u2019t bothered to finish the job once
    started. Arramida didn\u2019t have any equipment to enter the ship and fetch the
    bodies, but a few careful slashes with laser cannon carved the ship up nicely.
    Then it was just a matter of sending in a couple of salvage drones to pick up
    the cryo-caskets. The crude operation naturally killed the sleepers, but the job
    didn\u2019t require him to bring back any survivors, so it didn\u2019t worry him
    all too much.\n\nArramida quickly scooped all the caskets into his own ship, taking
    care not to spoil any of the bodies. Norid had been very specific that none of
    the remains should be damaged. As an afterthought, Arramida scooped up some cargo
    containers floating out of the wreckage \u2013 nothing wrong with earning something
    a little extra on the side, he thought. Once finished, he set his course to Rethan
    V to turn in the bodies and collect his reward.\n\nThe moment Arramida had undocked
    from the clone station he sent a message to Norid, telling him the job was done.
    Then, chuckling over the fortune he\u2019s made for such an easy job, he made
    his way to the nearest leisure station.\n\nNorid re-read the message from Arramida
    with glee. At last, the final part of his revenge was in motion! The sweet taste
    of it, after all these years of plotting and planning, shook his frail old body.
    Of course Norid wasn\u2019t his real name. He would never reveal that to an oaf
    like Arramida. But Norid was a good name, maybe he would continue to use it once
    it was over. Yes, that was a good idea, he decided. It nicely underlined the new
    beginning he would make after the deed was done, when he could finally throw off
    his shackles and rise like a Phoenix to his former glory.\n\nNorid sent a quick
    message to the clone station, giving them the necessary DNA information to pinpoint
    the body he wanted sent to him. The rest they could use themselves as a form of
    payment for the services. The body he wanted should arrive within the next two
    days. Just as he finished sending the message, his master rang him. It was time
    for the master\u2019s tea.\n\nNorid was a slave. He had been slave for almost
    a century. He was getting old, but the implants he had from the time when he was
    a Holder were still ticking along nicely. Norid certainly didn\u2019t feel two
    centuries old. Occasionally his implants needed a little bit of maintenance, but
    his master was kind enough to allow them. If only he knew that by doing so he
    was aiding Norid in executing his revenge on him.\n\nNorid scuttled along the
    corridor with the tea tray and entered the study. The master could have used service
    robots or android automatons, but like all Amarr Holders he wanted the respectability
    of having a slave serve upon him. Norid didn\u2019t blame him \u2013 soon he would
    have slaves of his own.\n\nNorid scrutinized the master. He was old, even older
    than Norid, and once the two of them had been bitter rivals in Ardishapur\u2019s
    court. Even after all this time, Norid could still feel the hatred coursing through
    his veins \u2013 hatred towards this man for what he had done to him and his family.
    Crushed like little pegs in political machinations, they had been stripped of
    their titles, their wealth and their ancestry, then sold like common slaves. His
    wife and son hadn\u2019t survived long in the forced-labor camp. But he had survived,
    kept alive by his hatred for the man that was responsible for ruining him and
    killing the two people he loved.\n\nFor years Norid had nurtured his hatred, using
    it to drive him onwards \u2013 towards revenge. Slowly, but surely, he had inched
    closer to his nemesis, until he had entered his service as an attendant slave.
    The master didn\u2019t recognize Norid for who he was \u2013 he only knew he was
    a former Holder. Having a former Holder as his personal slave sustained the vanity
    of the master.\n\nIn the decades since Norid had plotted his master\u2019s downfall.
    Death wasn\u2019t good enough. Something more elaborate was needed \u2013 a poetic
    justice. And now, the plan was finally bearing fruit. The body of the master\u2019s
    son was on his way \u2013 rescued from the ship Norid had sabotaged long ago,
    waiting in his cold grave for the time when he became useful to Norid\u2019s plans.\n\nNow
    that time had come. For years Norid had lurked in the shadows, gnawing at the
    political and financial strength of the master. All that was needed now was a
    slight push to crush the master\u2019s prestige once and for all, ruining him
    as completely at he had once ruined Norid. But that wasn\u2019t enough. Norid
    smiled at the thought of what was to come.\n\nHis master, sipping his tea, noticed
    it.\n\n\u201CWhy are you smiling like a fool?\u201D he asked sternly. Norid bowed
    his head slightly.\n\n\u201CBecause I\u2019m happy to report that I found a suitable
    replacement for your clone that was accidentally destroyed last week,\u201D he
    answered. \u201CIt will be ready in two days.\u201D \n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 he thought.
    \u2018And then I will kill you and you will be cloned in your son\u2019s body,
    and then I will ruin you and take your place.\u2019 Norid started smiling again
    and served his master another cup of tea. "
