    \"Hello Garmasi. I hear you like getting people in trouble.\"\n\nThe Amarrian
    whose name had been spoken slowly put the merchandise back on the vendor's display
    bench, and stood up straight. His wrinkled features coagulated into a smile.\n\nTo
    the voice behind his right ear he said, \"Depends on who deserves it. How did
    you get out?\"\n\nThe voice said, \"We had some help. Amazing what people will
    descend to doing, just for their own personal interest.\"\n\n\"Isn't it just?\"
    Garmasi said. \"But if you don't mind me asking, what makes you think that coming
    here, out in the open, is going to do you any good? Do you perhaps have a laser
    knife on your person?\"\n\n\"None such,\" the voice said.\n\n\"A small gun, silenced
    or perhaps pressurized, and loaded with change-state ammo? Something to really
    put me in my place, during those last few agonizing seconds of my life?\"\n\n\"Not
    at all.\"\n\n\"Disintegrating garrote,\" he said. \"At least that. To lure me
    into a dark alley and snap on that self-tightening noose that does the job for
    you.\"\n\n\"Nothing of the sort.\"\n\nGarmasi turned and faced her. \"So what
    exactly is to prevent me from calling the guards and having your\"-he looked her
    over-\"admittedly marvelous figure thrown right back in jail, now on suspicion
    of disorderly conduct, kidnapping and jailbreak?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't think you
    want to do that,\" Joreena said. \"But I do think you want to tell me about your
    plans.\"\n\n\"I do?\" Garmasi said with a smirk. From his seat behind the display
    board the vendor coughed politely, for the pair was blocking sight to his merchandise,
    but neither one of them moved. When he coughed again, the Amarrian turned to him
    and in one swift motion pulled out a datacard, keyed in a number, touched the
    card to the vendor's scanner, plunged the card back in his pocket and hit the
    scanner's confirmation pad with a fist. A series of digits scrolled up on its
    screen. The vendor promptly shut up.\n\n\"You do,\" Joreena said. \"You had us
    arrested on small charges, but you've been hanging out here with not a worry in
    the world. You must have figured we'd be coming after you and messing up your
    business.\"\n\n\"Not really, dear,\" Garmasi said. \"We have no real business
    here other than to protect our client. As for you coming after us, one of our
    guys knows a thing or two about Gurista datasystems. I'm afraid we gave you a
    rather ugly past. Nothing worthy of a capital offence, but certainly enough to
    have you retained while the authorities figure out what to do with creatures like
    you.\"\n\n\"Creatures like us?\"\n\nHe shrugged and smiled. \"Fires. Children.
    You're bad people.\"\n\nJoreena stared at him for a moment, then smiled and seemed
    to make up her mind about something. \"So we'll disappear. Strike at you from
    the shadows. And we will get our target.\"\n\n\"You'll do nothing of the sort,\"
    Garmasi said. He stepped in and took firm hold of Joreena's upper arm, turned
    his head and said to the vendor, \"Triple the amount I gave you if you get the
    guards here right now.\"\n\nThe vendor nodded eagerly and moved his hand underneath
    his stall. There was a clanging noise, and suddenly guards were all over the place.\n\n\"I'm
    afraid this is the end, my dear,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes. It is,\" she said.\n\nThe
    guards moved in.\n\n\"It's a shame you didn't have any other purpose here. We
    might have come to some kind of arrangement,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh, it's far too
    late for that now,\" he said.\n\n\"Certainly,\" she replied, quite sanguine.\n\nHe
    furrowed his brows, but didn't have time to say anything else, for a muscular
    hand was clamped on his shoulder. \"Alright, murderer. Time to go.\"\n\nHe looked
    around. A large Guristas guard stood there, backed by five others. Two of them
    already had their stun batons out.\n\nGarmasi stammered out \"Wait, what-\" before
    the guard holding him pulled back a fist and punched him in the stomach. \"Shut
    up, asshole,\" the guard said as the Amarrian doubled up.\n\nJoreena knelt beside
    him. \"Save your breath,\" she said. \"You'll need it for the interrogation. I
    hear it's a little harsh for someone of your reputation.\"\n\nGarmasi's eyes bulged
    at her.\n\n\"You're bad people now,\" she whispered and blew him a kiss before
    the guards dragged him away.\n\n***\n\nThe good thing about doing your own crazy
    science experiments in warehouses and empty rooms across the universe was that
    you learned to recognize the signs. Artenal approached the building, taking his
    time and looking closely at its doors and windows.\n\nThere wouldn't be a risk
    of explosives or other area-of-effect damage from this guy. Drones meant accuracy
    and clean hands. That suited Artenal fine. He wanted to get dirty.\n\nOn the other
    hand, drones could also mean early warning systems, and fighting conducted from
    a distance. Artenal walked very slowly and used his eye for patterns. Nothing
    beeped, and nothing blinked, and it seemed like his opponent hadn't rigged up
    anything at all. It was understandable \u2013 the man was leaving soon and his
    enemies were supposed to be rotting in prison \u2013 but very stupid. It was assumptions
    like this that got a person hurt.\n\nArtenal grinned, and patted the small sphere
    in his pocket.\n\nThe warehouse door was creaky, but a gearhead always carried
    some kind of oil. He made his way deeper into the building.\n\nInside, its periphery
    was dotted with all manner of debris and junk - mostly skeletons of hover vehicles
    that had been scrounged for every useable part - but the center was an open area
    that had been cleared out. In it, by a metal workbench, sat the Gallente man Artenal
    had seen at the bar, quietly tinkering with something. The high roof and bare
    walls caused every metallic click from the Gallentean's tools to echo.\n\n\"Safety's
    the illusion of the unprepared, Ontre,\" Artenal said, stepping out from cover.
    Ontre looked up and regarded him for a moment before bowing back to his work.\n\nWhen
    there was no further reaction, Artenal walked a few steps closer. He was too far
    from the Gallente mercenary to see what he was working on, other than a pile of
    silvery mechanics and a mess of wires, but close enough that he could see several
    small attack drones lying neatly sorted on the edge of the bench.\n\n\"Are you
    going to turn those on?\" Artenal said, with perfect calm.\n\nOntre stopped his
    task and for the first time seemed to properly register Artenal's presence, looking
    at him with quiet interest. \"Should I?\" he said.\n\n\"It's either that or you
    surrender and come have an unpleasant conversation with me and some friends of
    mine.\"\n\nOntre seemed to honestly consider this for a moment. Then he shrugged,
    said, \"I do have a lot of work to do here, you know,\" and reached out for a
    switch on a small activation board lying on the bench.\n\nThe air was filled with
    an angry buzz as the drones came to life. Ontre adjusted a few settings on the
    board, then leaned on one elbow and watched Artenal.\n\nIt took a few seconds
    for the electric machines to rise in the air and orient themselves. They hovered
    ever higher, adjusting their formations and apparently communicating with other.
    Despite himself, Artenal was fascinated. \"Do they always take this long to get
    into gear?\" he asked. \"If I had a gun you'd be dead by now.\"\n\n\"They go from
    zero to kill in point eight five seconds per meter in mid-air, assuming no wind.
    There're some emergency features, too, that let them launch themselves up or even
    directly at someone. Total from offline to guaranteed impact is one point one
    two, with my hand on the activation trigger,\" the Gallentean said. \"And if you'd
    had a gun you would've shot me at range, so I figured I might as well let them
    go through the whole syncing routine. They get a little grumpy if I use them too
    much with realignment.\"\n\n\"Let's see what they can do, then,\" Artenal said
    and started walking towards the mercenary. The drones, who were floating in the
    rafters by now, immediately turned their electric eyes to him. There was an echo
    of a dozen little prods extending from their carapaces, followed by the crackle
    of electricity.\n\nAs Ontre shrugged and flicked another switch on his control
    board, Artenal reached into his pocket and pulled out the EMP bomb. The drones
    roared downwards, electric oblivion aimed at Artenal, and it took more self-control
    than he'd expected not to run. He clicked on the bomb and tossed in the air.\n\nThere
    was a whomph, and the drones clattered lifelessly onto the ground along with the
    spent bomb.\n\nOntre frowned. Instead of reacting to Artenal's approaching presence,
    he looked back to his work and prodded it a few times with a screwdriver. \"You
    just cost me a full day of very complex work,\" he said.\n\n\"Shame. Maybe next
    time you'll know better than to mess with us,\" Artenal said. He was closing in
    on the Gallentean and had started to reach out a hand that he expected would grab
    the man by his neck, when the mercenary ducked, shot in and clamped his arms around
    Artenal's knees, tripping him up. Ontre immediately followed through, resting
    one knee on Artenal's sternum and pinning him, the other leg stretched out for
    ballast, and started raining punches on his head.\n\nThe shock of the attack cost
    Artenal several valuable seconds, and his vision had begun to blur at the edges
    when his brain caught up with what his body was undergoing. He bucked his hip,
    then dropped it again and rolled away, getting to his knees. As the Gallentean
    rushed towards him, he pulled his small steel blade out of a hidden part on his
    belt and held it behind his hands, feigning wooziness. The mercenary aimed a kick
    at his head, and as it curved close Artenal swiped his knife at the leg. He'd
    been hoping to hit a tendon, but the blade buried itself midway into Ontre's calf,
    and the kick hit the side of his head with lessened force that was nonetheless
    enough to nearly knock him out.\n\nOntre dropped to the floor, screaming. He tried
    pulling out the knife, but its notched edge wouldn't budge. By the time he had
    the sense to look up again, Artenal's other hidden knife slid neatly under his
    chin and into his head.\n\nOntre slumped, lifeless.\n\nArtenal sat there for a
    long time, reflecting on career choices, and on the idiocy of assumptions.\n\n***\n\nIt
    was dark and the alley was deep, but he had been told she would be here. He knew
    she wouldn't be, at least not unprepared and certainly not by herself, but that
    was all right; he'd made preparations of his own.\n\nKralean walked about slowly,
    listening for noise and for silence.\n\n\"Hello, weakling,\" a voice said.\n\nHe
    turned. A woman of Minmatar origin entered the mouth of the alley. She wasn't
    dressed in much, and the distant lights of neon and stars made her dark skin glisten,
    highlighting its tattoos and scars. Kralean saw the cut of her muscles, which
    writhed like coiled snakes, insinuating themselves in effortless motion. It was
    the woman from the bar, but he hadn't paid any attention to her back then.\n\nShe
    was followed by a dozen people, all of whom looked like they came from the darkest
    part of space.\n\n\"Word has it you've been going after my associates. Got free
    somehow, think you're gonna be real clever and take us out. I tried contacting
    them, thought it was just the usual Guristas shit station service. Turns out it's
    you, and that you've turned the guards against us.\"\n\n\"That would be Artenal.
    He figured you'd be easier dealt with if we imposed a blackout. Sorry about the
    inconvenience,\" Kralean said and put his hands in his pockets. The Minmatar woman's
    associates tensed up, so Kralean added, \"I'm not pulling a gun. Relax.\"\n\n\"So
    I let word spread that I'm panicking,\" the Minmatar woman said, \"And set up
    a meeting with an escape contact. Lo and behold, you show up. Where are your pals?\"\n\n\"I
    honestly have no idea,\" Kralean said. \"I explicitly requested that I get you
    to myself, and I see I made the right choice.\"\n\nThe Minmatar woman frowned.
    She turned to one of her associates and said, \"Kill him.\"\n\nThe man nodded
    and wordlessly started making his way into the alley. When he'd covered half the
    distance, Kralean pulled out of his pocket a small item and said, \"Come any closer
    and I'll press it.\"\n\nEveryone froze in place. In calm and very clear tones,
    the woman said. \"What is it you have there?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's just a button,\"
    Kralean said, and pressed it. To his great enjoyment, everyone but him pinched
    their eyes shut for a second, then looked around in amazement. \"Told you,\" he
    said.\n\n\"Great Tribe of earth and sky,\" the Minmatar woman said in exasperation,
    sighing with spent adrenaline. \"Kill him!\"\n\nHer man moved in. Kralean smiled.
    There was a brief scuffle.\n\nAfter the man's body had stopped twitching, Kralean
    dusted off his robes and said, \"Look, maybe we can work this out.\"\n\nThe Minmatar
    woman and her people stared at the broken form lying by Kralean's legs. She said,
    \"What ... what do you suggest?\"\n\n\"Well, you've got a tiny golden Khuumak
    hanging around your neck. I like those, they're cute. Break it off and toss it
    to me, and I'll give you a running start.\"\n\nEven at this distance he could
    see her face tense up and her jaw clench. \"Don't forget to recite the names of
    the Emperors,\" he added. \"You must've been taught them at some point.\"\n\nShe
    looked directly into his eyes and said in a dead voice, \"You will never walk
    out of this alley alive.\" She started walking towards him, her team in tow.\n\nHe
    gave a brief smile and cocked his head, as if listening, then looked towards the
    sky.\n\nHad this been a mere alley fight, he thought, she would have continued.
    But even despite her visible rage she stopped, and told her men to stop as well.\n\nHe
    found himself relieved that he'd secured backup. The transmitter in his pocket
    felt far too light, but he pressed it again, sending the second and final message.\n\n\"Why
    are we waiting?\" one of them said, in the plaintive tones of a child being told
    it can't play with its favorite toy. \"He's just standing there.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\"
    she said. \"That's the problem. What are you listening for, preacher man?\"\n\n\"The
    people,\" he said. \"And I think they're arriving.\"\n\nThere was a susurrus in
    the air. Kralean said, \"You know, most people had the sense not to help you out.
    The ones who did sign up in your little crew are the ones that everybody else
    on this station positively hates and fears. But there's strength in numbers.\"\n\n\"What
    are you talking about?\"\n\n\"There's a lot of faith in a place like this,\" he
    said. \"And it took quite a bit of convincing, but I've been a Wanderer for the
    Speakers of Truth for a long time, and I know what to tell the people who want
    to hear, and how to listen to those who otherwise never get to speak.\"\n\nThe
    susurrus turned into a tremor. The mercenaries looked around and saw groups of
    people pouring into the alley.\n\n\"You really should have listened,\" Kralean
    said before the beatings began.\n\n***\n\nShahoun moved through the darkening
    night, alone and unprotected.\n\nThe last of his team had vanished. They'd been
    heading towards the docking area when his Caldari bodyguard stopped them, saying
    he'd heard a noise. The guard had ordered him to stay put, then gone off to investigate
    and never come back. He'd heard a woman's laughter in the distance and it had
    given him the shivers. He ran.\n\nNow he was at the docks, moments away from his
    ship. Nothing mattered but to get away.\n\nThe customs agent took a long time
    looking over his data. Then he said to Shahoun, \"I'm sorry, sir. Your ship has
    been sequestered.\"\n\nHe did not even bother arguing. \"Is there any way I can
    get off this station? Any way at all? Please?\"\n\nThe customs agent looked at
    him for far too long.\n\n\"Look,\" Shahoun said, \"I'm very sorry if I'm being
    too forward here. I don't mean to imply anything about you, your job or personal
    ethics. But I absolutely positively have to get somewhere very soon, and I'll
    do anything I can to make it happen. Please. I'm begging you.\"\n\n The agent
    kept looking. Then at last he said, \"Well, sir, your ship has been seized but
    you're under no official obligation to stay, though I don't doubt you will be
    once investigations have run their course. But I can see you're in dire straits,
    and I'm willing to consider a compromise.\"\n\n\"Name it. Anything,\" Shahoun
    said.\n\n\"There's a ship leaving soon, and I know someone on it. Spoke to him
    earlier tonight, as a matter of fact. They've finished their business here and
    have plenty of room for passengers. I'm sure you could bargain with them to get
    you where you want. They're good people.\"\n\n\"Thank you, please. Yes. That would
    be most wonderful.\"\n\nThe customs agent handed him a card. \"So if you'll just
    make a quick donation to the customs agent retirement fund, I'm sure we can sort
    you out.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course,\" Shahoun said and grinned. \"How much?\"\n\n\"How
    much is it worth to you?\" the customs agent said without expression.\n\nShahoun
    signed off an amount, and the agent looked it over and nodded. \"Section 34C,
    red area, sir. Move quickly, now.\"\n\n\"Thank you so much,\" Shahoun said and
    ran off.\n\nHe made it to the ship on time, was waved through by another customs
    agent without a word, and went into one of its waiting chambers, where he sat
    down with a heavy sigh of relief. He didn't want to talk to anyone just yet, merely
    to be whisked away into the oblivion of deep space.\n\nAfter not too long the
    outside door closed automatically. The only other door was the one that lead deeper
    into the ship, standing ajar.\n\nThere was a tink from that door. Shahoun looked
    up and saw a big, burly Minmatar man smiling at him, a small canister in one hand.
    The man threw the canister at Shahoun, who instinctively grabbed it.\n\n\"Welcome
    onboard,\" Artenal said and shut the door. The canister started hissing, and let
    out a white non-odorous gas that filled the room.\n\nShahoun's felt inertia pull
    hard on him, though through the increasing fuzziness of his thoughtweb he didn't
    know whether the ship was taking off or if he was merely losing his consciousness.
    It felt oddly relieving.\n\nHis last thoughts before passing out was that he really
    should have hired these people instead.\n"
