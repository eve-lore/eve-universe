- body: "## Ammatar Mandate\n\nFormed by members of the Nefantar tribe during the
    imperial occupation of the Matari home worlds, the Ammatar Mandate was initially
    composed of those Minmatar who collaborated heavily with the forces of the Amarr
    Empire. Given their unpopular choice of siding with the Amarr and their branding
    as traitors by their Matari brethren, the Nefantars fled Minmatar space during
    the Minmatar Rebellion against imperial rule and subsequently were settled by
    the Amarr emperor in a region under imperial oversight that lay close to the border
    with Minmatar space.\n\nInitially, these Minmatar were simply regarded as Matari
    subjects under imperial rule. However, relatively soon after they were settled
    into the region of Derelik, they became known as the Ammatar, establishing their
    own regional consulate and navy under the rule of the empire. The Ammatar Consulate
    oversees what is effectively a semisovereign state, politically and economically
    bound to the Amarr Empire. The consulate remains the highest government office
    in the mandate and oversees the day-to-day running of the mandate. While staffed
    by Ammatar personnel, the consulate still bows to the ultimate power of an Amarrian
    governor, appointed by the reigning monarch of the Amarr Empire.\n\nTo this day,
    the political situation between the empire and the mandate remains unchanged,
    with Empress Jamyl I having placed the mandate under the vassalage of the Ardishapur
    family on her return to the empire, thereby charging Yonis Ardishapur, current
    heir for the family, with the responsibility of oversight and leadership of the
    Ammatar people as their governor.\n\nAs governor, Yonis Ardishapur also acts as
    the commander in chief of the Ammatar military, namely the Ammatar Fleet, a force
    large enough to keep the mandate\u2019s borders protected and the republic at
    bay. Consisting mainly of former Imperial Navy service vessels handed down to
    the mandate after being decommissioned from the empire, the Ammatar Fleet is neither
    impressive in scale nor technologically sophisticated.\n\nWhat it does lack on
    these fronts, however, it makes up for in pure striking power. The fleet consists
    mainly of attack battleships and heavy assault cruisers that are often called
    into service to assist with imperial border patrols. The mandate enjoys a semiautonomous
    political status and maintains positive standings with the allies of the Amarr
    Empire, most notably the Caldari State and, by extension, Mordu\u2019s Legion."

    ### Ammatar Consulate

    The Ammatars have a semi-sovereign state bound to the Amarr Empire. The Ammatar
    Consulate is the highest governmental office for the Ammatars and takes care of
    the general running of the Ammatar state. It is manned by Ammatars, but they all
    bow to the Ammatar governor, who is an Amarr.


    ### Ammatar Fleet

    The Amarrians allow the Ammatars to operate their own fleet, knowing that it will
    be employed against the Minmatars that otherwise would harass the Amarr Empire.
    The Ammatar Fleet is neither big nor sophisticated, but it''s strong enough to
    keep the Minmatars at bay.


    ### Nefantar Miner Association

    The Nefantar Miner Association is primarily a mining company, but with a strong
    militaristic overtone. This is because it operates mostly in the areas between
    Ammatar and Minmatar space. The area has many rich mineral zones, making it coveted
    by more or less everyone.'
