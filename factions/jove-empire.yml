- body: "## The Jove Empire\n__The Jove Empire__ has always been a mystery to the
    other nations of New Eden, particularly as every new insight into its inscrutable
    people tends to do little but raise more questions. First encounters with the
    Jove are inevitably conditioned by the unsettling appearance of members of their
    race. The Jove have practiced genetic manipulation of their population for millennia
    and, while still human, can seem quite alien to others, due to their distinctive
    skin texture, disturbingly symmetrical facial features, and lustrous black eyes.
    Those who spend much time with Jovian individuals speak of them as almost inhuman
    in their lack of emotion, yet clearly driven by powerful impulses kept under careful
    control.\n\nEnigmatic as they are, the Jove are impossible to dismiss. One reason
    is their technological superiority. Jovian technology has arguably had a bigger
    hand in shaping the New Eden of today than any other force in the last century.
    Perhaps the most far-reaching example of this was the Jovian introduction of capsule
    technology to the Caldari, which paved the way for the capsuleer of today.\n\nDespite
    the best efforts of innumerable researchers, very little is clearly known about
    the history of the Jove Empire. Even in the early days when contacts were being
    forged with the other empires, and the Jove took an active role in shaping interstellar
    society and the CONCORD Assembly, very few of their number were actually encountered
    in the core empires of New Eden.\n\nThe territory claimed by the Jove Empire itself
    is spread across two regions on the edges of the New Eden cluster. The low numbers
    of Jove traveling into the core regions were initially attributed to the distances
    involved, as well as an aloof attitude in general. Over time, however, it came
    to be realized that the Jove had a relatively small population compared to the
    other interstellar powers, and it was learned that a deadly genetic malady, the
    Jovian disease, afflicted their race. Even so, it was still obvious that Jovian
    technology outmatched everything available to the core empires by orders of magnitude.
    The starkest reminder of the Jove Empire\u2019s technological lead over the other
    empires was provided at the Battle of Vak\u2019Atioth, where an entire Amarrian
    invasion force was laid to waste by a Jovian mother ship.\n\nIn recent times the
    Jove have withdrawn, ever more reluctant to intervene in the affairs of other
    empires. It has been several years since a Jovian delegation to CONCORD has appeared,
    and their section of the CONCORD Assembly station has been left vacant for even
    longer than that. Jovian commercial interests in New Eden remain in the form of
    their corporations, such as Genolution and Impro, but these are staffed by employees
    drawn from the other races. Some whisper that the Jove are gone for good\u2014even
    dead, finally wiped out by the Jovian disease or some other catastrophe. Others
    point out that activity can still be detected in the Jove Empire, and that someone,
    or something, continues to defend their territory from unwelcome visitors."

    ### Jovian Directorate

    The Jovian directorate is believed to be the highest governmental authority in
    the Jove Empire, though this has never been confirmed or denied by the Jovians.
    The inner workings of the directorate are also uncertain.


    ### Jove Navy

    No one knows how big the Jove Navy is, though judging by the number of Jovians
    it can''t be all that big. Yet it is universally revered and feared, considered
    the most powerful of all the empire''s fleets. Its reputation dates from the Amarr-Jove
    War when it decimated a whole Amarrian armada in a single battle.


    ### Academy for Aggressive Behaviour

    Most Jovians have had their aggressive instincts curbed or even removed through
    genetic engineering. The Academy for Aggressive Behaviour, responsible for training
    space cadets, uses the latest in gene therapies to re-introduce the base instincts
    to their students to ensure the animalistic nature of humans, so important for
    fighting, is alive and fresh in them.


    ### Material Institute

    The Jovians, with all their power and resources, are not always very pragmatic.
    The Material Institute was founded precisely to combat this. Most Jovians are
    already well schooled in the technical aspects, but they need some tutoring on
    the practical application for use in industry and manufacturing.


    ### Prosper

    Prosper is a financial corporation that has in recent years invested in several
    hi-tech companies around the world. It has never sought a majority ownership in
    any company and has a policy of non-interference. Nevertheless, most companies
    welcome their capital with open arms, simply for the prestige that having a Jovian
    investor gives.


    ### Shapeset

    Shapeset is the main manufacturer of Jovian ships and ship modules. It operates
    solely within Jovian space and has refused all approaches from abroad to sell
    the products to non-Jovians.


    ### Former Jove Corporations

    In YC118, the Genolution, Impro, and X-Sense corporations were transferred to
    the ownership of the [Society of Conscious Thought](2gDU7gDW99fli3iIfSmZNp).'
