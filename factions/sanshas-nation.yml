- body: 'Sansha''s Nation was founded more than a century ago, shortly after all the
    empires had come into contact, just when space exploration and colonization was
    taking off. [Sansha Kuvakei](17GtFlYwgztQDPD4Uotuv8) was a Caldari tycoon that
    carved out a sizeable piece of space for himself. There, he set out to create
    an utopian state. His vision and charm attracted thousands of people and for some
    time the Nation flourished. But Sansha became ever more warped as his success
    increased. He started experiments, combining capsule technology with the human
    mind, creating zombie-like creatures that had the cold, calculating mind of a
    computer, but the ingenuity of humans.


    When this became public knowledge Sansha was condemned and the other empires joined
    forces to bring him down. His forces were decimated and scattered to the winds.
    Remnants still remain far in the outer regions, but the once glorious Nation has
    been reduced to pirates and pillagers.'

- body: "## Sansha's Nation\n\nThere are many horrors along the fringes and in the
    dark places of [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk), but few of these are as feared
    as Sansha\u2019s Nation. The existence of the Nation is a testament to the dark
    possibilities of technology and the will of one man, Sansha Kuvakei. The genius
    of Sansha founded and sustained the Nation, but his vision of an intellectual
    elite served by cybernetically dominated slaves led to its downfall. Yet, for
    all that they tried to scrub out the stain of Sansha\u2019s Nation, the empires
    failed and the dream lived on. Slowly but implacably, Sansha\u2019s Nation rose
    again.\n\nFor a hundred years, the Nation was little more than a presence haunting
    the space lanes and remote corners of New Eden, but now they are once more a force
    to be reckoned with. Sansha Kuvakei himself, believed dead for decades, has returned
    and reclaimed his place at the head of the cybernetic legions of the Nation. The
    old empires see the incursions by Sansha\u2019s fleets and True Slave soldiers,
    and they see a threat that could destroy them. So grave is this threat that they
    must call on the double-edged sword of the capsuleer to help throw back the invading
    servants of their old enemy."

    ### True Creations

    Despite the fact that Sansha''s Nation was destroyed decades ago, remnants still
    remain in deep space and are in many ways growing in stature. True Creations operate
    several shipyards that are increasing the number of Sansha''s ships roaming space
    each and every day.


    ### True Power

    True Power is what remains of the military arm of Sansha''s Nation. Though it
    is mainly concerned about protecting the remaining assets of the Nation, it also
    is engaged in mining and manufacturing operations to maintain its strength.
