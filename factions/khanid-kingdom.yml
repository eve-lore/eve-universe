- body: 'The Khanid Kingdom, also known as the Dark Amarr, was founded a few centuries
    ago when the last Amarr Emperor was chosen. Khanid was one of the royal heirs
    at the time and, in accordance with tradition, should have killed himself after
    failing to become emperor. This Khanid refused to do and split his vast domains
    from the Amarr Empire.


    The empire retaliated, but only managed to conquer some of the vulnerable outer
    regions from Khanid. The Kingdom still upholds many of the traditions of Amarr
    society, but has also wholeheartedly embraced the customs of others, mainly the
    Caldari. Many visitors to the Kingdom feel like it is a surreal mix of the Amarr
    and Caldari empires. '
