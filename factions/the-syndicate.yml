- body: "## Intaki Syndicate\n\nInitially formed by exiles from the Gallente Federation
    during the Gallente-Caldari War, the Intaki Syndicate resides within its namesake
    region of Syndicate, bordering the federation. Over the course of the last century,
    the syndicate has slowly grown in stature, working to increase its political and
    financial capital to ensure it remains an important link between the core empires
    and the illegal elements found in the outer regions.\n\nThe settled planets and
    stations within the syndicate operate as autonomous, financially and politically
    independent entities, all of which cooperate on the basis of collective information
    sharing and provision of security. Although widely regarded as a pirate haven,
    the syndicate still maintains enough rule of law within its territories to allow
    almost anyone to pass through or travel for business. To this end, since empire
    policing within its borders has always been a relatively rare occurrence, the
    syndicate set up its own law enforcement arm in YC 72, branded as Intaki Space
    (ISP), to encourage prospective customers to travel without fear within its borders.
    Although rumored to be highly corrupt, this organization is ruthless when it comes
    to quelling unrest and is generally regarded as a heavy-handed but highly effective
    law enforcement entity.\n\nAs well as protecting trade routes, ISP also protects
    and guards the assets of the Intaki Bank, which has seen a boom in business since
    it opened its doors to public account holders and decided to keep the names and
    transactions of all account holders highly confidential. It remains widely known
    that hundreds of billions of dirty kredits pass through the Intaki banking system
    per month from black market trading and other illegal ventures, though it remains
    the general consensus of the syndicate that if they do not provide this service,
    someone else will.\n\nThe biggest account holder with the Intaki Bank by far remains
    Intaki Commerce, which handles the largest volume of black market transactions
    in New Eden. Intaki Commerce stations are often used as a neutral meeting ground
    where black market traders from the outer regions can meet merchants from empire
    space. Intaki Commerce, via the Intaki Space Police, provides security for these
    meetings, cutting a sizable profit from all transactions for the syndicate.\n\nUnofficially
    run by a ruthless former Sister of EVE by the name of Silphy en Diabel, who returned
    to syndicate space to reclaim her father\u2019s fortune, the syndicate remains
    the largest black market and money laundering organization in the cluster and
    is rumored to have dealings with every major outlaw organization in New Eden."

    ### Intaki Syndicate

    Formed by Intaki exiles from the Gallente Federation during the Caldari-Gallente
    War, the Syndicate has slowly grown in stature and influence. It now serves as
    an important link between the empires and the illegal elements in the outer regions.
    Syndicate space is a pirate haven but still retains enough civility to allow pretty
    much anyone to travel there for business. Its markets are always chock full of
    contraband goods and illegal wares that are hard or impossible to come by elsewhere.
    Each Syndicate station is an autonomous entity, but they cooperate on security
    and information issues. The unofficial leader of the Syndicate is Silphy en Diabel,
    a former Sister of EVE who returned to Syndicate space to save her family''s fortune.
    Since then she''s turned out to be just as resourceful and ruthless as her late
    father.


    ### Intaki Bank

    The Intaki Bank has seen brisk business in the decade since it decided to keep
    the names on all accounts secret and inaccessible to anyone. Everyone knows that
    dirty money pours in and out of the bank, but the general consensus of the Syndicate
    is that if it doesn''t provide this service, then someone else will.


    ### Intaki Commerce

    The Syndicate is the biggest black market dealer in the world of EVE, a place
    where shady traders from the outer regions can meet merchants from empire space.
    Intaki Commerce handles these transactions, making a nice profit for the Syndicate.


    ### Intaki Space Police

    The Syndicate wants their space to be relatively trouble-free, so as to encourage
    people to visit and spend their money. With empire policing infrequent, they employ
    their own police force to enforce the peace.'
