- body: "## Sisters of EVE\n\nThe Sisters of EVE (SoE) are a humanitarian organization
    that operates a large number of stations outside empire space in which travelers
    and those in need can seek refuge. As a religion-based organization, they are
    also actively engaged in a number of scientific pursuits seeking to unlock the
    secrets of the EVE Gate, which they believe is a gateway to heaven.\n\nThe Sisters
    are actively engaged in assisting all governments within the cluster with emergency
    aid delivery and disaster coordination. This is primarily undertaken by their
    Food Relief Division, which collects donations from across the cluster and uses
    them to purchase medical supplies and food, which is then distributed to those
    in need. \n\nThe Sanctuary division operates as the center of science and research
    for the Sisters, with its main project being the study and research of the EVE
    Gate. The Sanctuary also acts as a refuge, as do all other SoE stations.\n\nLed
    by Santimona Sarpati, sister of notorious Serpentis leader Salvador Sarpati, the
    Sisters of EVE can always be relied upon to be one of the first disaster relief
    organizations to arrive on the scene of any catastrophe. In the last ten years
    alone they have been involved in assisting relief efforts during some of the most
    high-profile disasters across New Eden."

    ### Sisters of EVE

    The Sisters of EVE are a humanitarian aid organization that is based on religion.
    The Sisters operate many stations outside empire space where weary travelers can
    seek refuge. SOE is also engaged in a scientific research project on the EVE gate,
    which they consider to be the gateway to heaven and are determined to unlock its
    secrets.


    ### Food Relief

    Food Relief is the humanitarian aid arm of the Sisters of EVE. The company collects
    donations from all over the world of EVE and uses them to buy food and medicine,
    which it then distributes to those in need.


    ### The Sanctuary

    The Sanctuary is the center of the science research the Sisters are undertaking
    on the EVE gate. It also acts as a typical refuge haven as all other SOE stations,
    but this activity is secondary to its scientific pursuits.
