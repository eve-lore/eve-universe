    a sort of \"disruptor\" start-up in the tech industry. AIR was founded by two
    entrepreneurs who split from their respective corporations to create their own:
    Elida Balashirian, formerly of the [Sisters of EVE](2rrk92bQtToCN1naxS0OSc), and
    Daisuke Ojala, formerly of the Ishukone Corporation. Both left their respective
    corporations in good standing, and have used the connections they formed there
    to help kickstart AIR's research and development projects. Their former organizations
    have been tremendously helpful when it comes to sharing knowledge and resources
    (from data to ships) so long as AIR is as willing to share the fruits of their
    own labor.\n\nFocused heavily on research and development of new technologies
    across multiple industries, AIR is something of a jack of all trades organization.
    The company has subdivisions that cover everything from combat-oriented technology,
    industrial and economic endeavors, and exploration-focused pursuits. One of their
    current projects involves the study, refinement, and iteration of neural data
    transfer and cloning technologies.\n\nThe corporation has launched a new pilot
    program\u2013the [Capsuleer Training Program](7pnycXWiN9qUmgsnOG2UAr#air-capsuleer-training-program)\u2013that
    involves testing their newly developed proprietary neural data transfer and cloning
    tech on aspiring capsuleers as a part of the AIR Capsuleer Training Program."
