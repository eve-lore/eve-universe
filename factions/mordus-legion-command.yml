    of Intaki military personnel sided with the Caldari. The Intakis were put into
    a separate unit with a Caldari officer named Mordu. After the war the Intakis
    settled in Caldari space, but unwillingly became entangled with Caldari locals
    in the Waschi Uprising. Mordu''s Legion was formed at that time as a mercenary
    fighting force and after the uprising it continued its existence.


    The Legion is loosely associated with the Caldari Navy, but is for the most part
    totally independent. Mordu''s Legion is commonly hired by companies to protect
    valuable assets outside empire space, for instance Outer Ring Excavations pays
    them handsomely to patrol the Outer Ring region.'

- body: "## Mordu's Legion\n\nFormed in the wake of the Waschi Uprising several decades
    ago, Mordu\u2019s Legion is one of the largest and most successful mercenary organizations
    in New Eden. The Legion can trace its roots back to the days of the Caldari-Gallente
    war, when a group of Intaki who sympathized with the Caldari cause was exiled
    from the federation at the start of the war. The most militant of these Intaki
    defected to the Caldari and requested to join in the fight against the Federation.
    Given that the majority were experienced military personnel, and therefore of
    immense value to the vastly outnumbered Caldari, they were placed into a separate
    squadron headed by a brilliant young Caldari officer named Muryia Mordu. By the
    time the war came to an end, this squadron, made up entirely of Intaki servicemen
    and women, had become a unit so celebrated within the Caldari Navy that their
    achievements fell squarely into the realm of modern legend.\n\nAt the end of the
    war, the Intaki personnel who served were offered land and accommodation in Waschi
    City on Kamokor IV, an arrangement that eventually resulted in tension between
    the new settlers and the indigenous locals. After a number of attacks on Waschi\u2019s
    Intaki population, Mordu\u2019s force was re-formed to defend the Intaki against
    the attacking Caldari radicals. This time, however, they flew under their own
    banner, calling themselves Mordu\u2019s Legion. Under the skillful command of
    Mordu himself, the Legion decimated the attacking force and kept the Intaki homes
    secure.\n\nSurprised and impressed by the skill and determination of the Legion\u2014which
    consisted mostly of grizzled veterans but also eager young hotheads drawn by its
    cachet\u2014the Caldari authorities offered to merge the squadron into the Caldari
    Navy, but this offer was declined by Mordu in favor of exploring the mercenary
    potential of the organization.\n\nToday Mordu\u2019s Legion, still headed up by
    Muryia Mordu himself, has grown to become the largest mercenary contractor in
    the cluster and still maintains close ties to the Caldari State. Initially the
    Legion would only accept citizens of the Caldari State, but in the last three
    decades it has opened its doors to those of any creed and race, providing they
    are not regarded as criminals within the state.\n\nMordu\u2019s Legion does not
    train its members. They expect all applicants to be seasoned combat veterans with
    demonstrable skill and knowledge of military tactics. In return, the Legion provides
    access to high-tech military equipment, most of which comes from the Caldari Navy,
    and a virtually endless supply of contract-based employment.\n\nGiven its status
    as the premier mercenary organization in the cluster, Mordu\u2019s Legion is often
    employed by governments across New Eden to settle issues that do not fall directly
    under a particular jurisdiction, particularly in cases where rapid deployment
    and swift resolution are required. The most recent example of this came after
    the federation\u2019s assault on Caldari Prime in March YC 115, when Mordu\u2019s
    Legion was drafted to provide security for the entire planet after it was declared
    a demilitarized zone at the cessation of hostilities.\n\nMordu\u2019s Legion Command
    remains to this day the most reliable and professional mercenary organization
    in the cluster, having since their formation maintained an untarnished reputation
    as fierce warriors, solid tacticians, and honorable business partners."
