- body: "## CONCORD Assembly\n\nThe Consolidated Cooperation and Relations Command
    Assembly, or CONCORD Assembly as it has become known, was founded over a century
    ago, after the five empires initially established contact with each other.\n\nFrom
    the outset interstellar relations were strained. That being the case, the main
    purpose of an agency like CONCORD was to ease the tension and create a foundation
    for peaceful cooperation between the empires. This endeavor is widely regarded
    as a success, given that while several flare-ups have occurred, and indeed the
    empires have come to blows since CONCORD\u2019s formation, a situation of all-out
    war has been avoided through careful mediation and negotiation."

- body: "## Corporations\n\n### CONCORD\nCONCORD was jointly formed a century ago
    by all the empires. The intention of it was to foster the fragile relationship
    between the empires and act as a meeting place where they could discuss their
    differences and hammer out a compromise solution. CONCORD has since taken on a
    life of its own, proud of its independence and determined to uphold its duties.\n\n###
    CONCORD Aerospace\nCONCORD's Directive Enforcement Department became concerned
    early in the Drifter Crisis that its inventory of ships could no longer meet its
    needs. The CONCORD Aerospace division therefore embarked on its \"Force Majeure
    Program\" to develop enhanced variants.\n\nWhile CONCORD Aerospace successfully
    upgraded DED's stable of vessels with hyper-advanced technology, the program became
    a severe drain on CONCORD's resources. Consequently, the Inner Circle authorized
    a limited release of CONCORD Aerospace's designs, stripped of CONCORD's advanced
    rapid-deployment and electronic warfare suites. The division was established as
    a subsidiary corporation to facilitate the release of these designs to the capsuleer
    market via authorized dealers.\n\n### DED\nThe police enforcement arm of CONCORD.
    DED has the responsibility of tracking down known criminals and attacking criminal
    facilities. They frequently operate outside empire space, wanting criminals to
    understand that they are nowhere safe from the long arm of the law.\n\n### Directive
    Intelligence Agency\nThe CONCORD Directive Intelligence Agency is an offshoot
    of the DED that provides a range of intelligence gathering and reporting services
    to CONCORD. The CDIA is also known for producing the CDIA Interstellar Fact Book
    and its series of briefing holos for capsuleers: the CDIA Files.\n\n### Independent
    Gaming Commission\nFormed in the wake of the YC105 Amarr Succession Trials when
    a group of entrepreneurs at the Secure Commerce Commission realised how popular
    structured combat tournaments were among capsuleers, the Independent Gaming Commission
    has grown from a small passion project into the CONCORD Assembly\u2019s regulatory
    body for all competitive sports.\n\nWith its own highly skilled team of engineers
    and state of the art shipyards that produce low volume bespoke versions of the
    most popular hulls in the cluster as prizes, the IGC maintains a healthy bottom
    line from event organization, sponsorship and adjudication across the cluster.\n\n###
    Inner Circle\nInner Circle is the top level department of CONCORD. The policies
    of CONCORD are discussed and decided on Inner Circle meetings, which are usually
    closed to the public. At first the members of the circle were nominated by the
    empires, but now they rise from the ranks of CONCORD employees. Thus, their loyalty
    is no longer bound to any one empire, but rather to CONCORD itself.\n\n### Project
    Discovery\nProject Discovery is a research corporation affiliated with the CONCORD
    Assembly. The organization is currently focused on studying an insidious viral
    threat sweeping across New Eden. \n\nThe corporation has contributed to a number
    of research endeavors and supports many more, including Professor Lundberg's foray
    into deciphering Drifter cellular anomalies and Professor Mayor's exoplanet hunting
    program. CONCORD assumed oversight of Project Discovery from the Sisters of EVE
    in July YC 119.\n\n### Secure Commerce Commission\nThe SCC is responsible for
    regulating and monitoring all trade transactions that take place on space stations.
    It has agents on all stations that record the transactions and they also offer
    courier and escrow services to make trade smooth.\n"
