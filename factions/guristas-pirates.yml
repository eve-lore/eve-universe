- body: "## Guristas Pirates\n\nFounded by the charismatic [Fatal](2cUo2UbsCruVr7VsIHmw1N)
    and technically-minded [Rabbit](3Mb6UfjhKf0MdSbbR4a2EU), the **Guristas** pirates
    are a fearless, professional and highly-organized outfit operating out of their
    home region of Venal. Unlike other rogue factions, their activities are based
    not around any twisted ideology or creed, but rather a good old-fashioned lust
    for wealth and power. \n\nThe Guristas focus primarily on interstellar piracy
    in the outer regions and low-security space. The Guristas maintain hundreds of
    deadspace listening posts and staging points on the Caldari border, and are known
    for being unafraid to stage strikes deep within the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy).\n\nTypically
    their business revolves around black-market trading, including human trafficking,
    illegal weapons manufacture, and smuggling of illicit goods. In addition to this,
    the Guristas control a large share of the gray market within the Caldari State,
    smuggling unregulated products into megacorporation enclaves within state borders.\n\nPossibly
    the most lucrative of their operations, however, are their counterfeiting circles.
    Unafraid to knock off anything from designer goods to hard currency, the Guristas
    will bluff any market that can cut them a clean and sizable profit. Just one example
    is their illegal currency exchange of Caldari corporate scrip, the largest network
    of its type in New Eden."
