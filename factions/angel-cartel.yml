- body: "## The Angel Cartel\n\nThe Angel Cartel is regarded by many law enforcement
    agencies as the most powerful and dangerous criminal organization in New Eden.
    The main reason for this assessment is the extent and scope of the cartel\u2019s
    criminal activities. While most of the major outlaw factions have operations spread
    throughout the cluster, the Angel Cartel is notable for the extent to which it
    has insinuated itself into the core empires, as well as its considerable interests
    in the outer regions. Few other criminal organizations, for example, could boast
    of strong links with the Minmatar underworld while at the same time illicitly
    supplying slaves to the less scrupulous holders of the Amarr Empire. When these
    interests are set next to the cartel\u2019s powerful presence in the Gallente
    illegal drugs market and the sinister tendrils it has inserted into the Caldari
    corporate world, it can be seen that the Angels\u2019 reach is long indeed.\n\nThe
    cartel has established itself as a power in the lawless outer regions, in particular
    the aptly named Curse region, where it controls numerous stations and colonies.
    The impressive military power of the cartel is perhaps most strikingly illustrated
    by the fact that it has an entire division, the Guardian Angels, dedicated to
    protecting the interests of its main partner in crime, the Serpentis Corporation.
    The connection with the Serpentis has served to give the Angels a permanent presence
    in the Fountain region, making the cartel one of the few criminal organizations
    to maintain major holdings outside its home region.\n\nThe Angel Cartel\u2019s
    reputation for ruthlessness and brutality has served to prevent interested parties
    from scrutinizing the organization\u2019s operations too closely, but those who
    have, perhaps foolishly, made it their business to study the cartel soon learn
    that it is more than a mere crime syndicate. The cartel has shown a marked interest
    in technologies new and ancient. It has made its headquarters in a region believed
    to have been the home of the First and Second Jovian Empires, and it typically
    discourages exploration and inquiry into its domains with a swift and absolute
    response. All this said, those students of the Angel Cartel who have survived
    long enough to put their thoughts on paper all agree on one point of note: the
    Angel Cartel seems to regard capsuleers as its greatest threat, not rival pirate
    groups and certainly not the old empires."

    ### Archangels

    The main arm of the Angel Cartel, the Archangels have no one center of operation,
    but can be seen roaming the space lanes most everywhere. They are equally adept
    at piracy, scavenging and smuggling.


    ### Dominations

    The Dominations is the command division of the Angel Cartel. The Dominations are
    quite elusive and seldom venture far from their bases in the Curse region. Little
    is known about the identities of the leaders of the Angel Cartel, though it is
    understood they come from all the races.


    ### Guardian Angels

    The Guardian Angels is a division of the Angel Cartel that are today exclusively
    occupied with guarding Serpentis space stations. The Serpentis Corporation pays
    the Angel Cartel handsomely for the protection, that is strong enough to keep
    even the DED at bay.


    ### Salvation Angels

    The Salvation Angels are the non-combat division of the Angel Cartel. The Salvation
    Angels are responsible for building and maintaining the Angels stations and space
    ships. For this, they frequently salvage what they need from the wrecks their
    fellow Angels have left behind.'
