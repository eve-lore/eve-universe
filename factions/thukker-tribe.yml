- body: 'The Thukker tribe is one of the seven original Minmatar tribes. After the
    Minmatar Rebellion the Thukkers left Minmatar space and took up the nomadic lifestyles
    of their ancestors, only this time in space.


    The closest thing they''ve got to home is the Great Wildlands region, where they
    are very numerous, but the Thukkers like to be on the move, constantly going from
    one solar system to another in their huge caravans, trading and scavenging. Many
    frown upon the Thukkers, considering them to be nothing but scoundrels and thieves.
    Indeed, the Thukkers often operate on the shadier side of the law, but their resourcefulness
    and diligence count a lot more for their success than their criminal activities.


    According to what remains of the historical records of the Minmatar, the Thukker
    tribe had always been a nomadic people, journeying back and forth across Matar
    in large caravans. The development of the old Minmatar Empire appears to have
    done little to inhibit the wandering of the Thukker. Indeed, the Great Caravanserai
    itself was constructed by the Thukker long ago to serve as a major junction in
    their network of routes and caravanserais. The Amarr found the Thukker intractable
    and many escaped to remote areas of space, forming the nucleus of the later culture
    of Great Caravans. The Thukker were notable fighters in the Great Rebellion but
    declined to join in the founding of the Republic. The wanderering Thukker Tribe
    officially joined the Republic in YC111, maintaining full autonomy of their Great
    Wildlands region but once more uniting the Minmatar as seven tribes.
