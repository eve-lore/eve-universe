- body: "## Outer Ring Excavations\n\nOuter Ring Excavations was formed in the Gallente
    Federation by an entrepreneur named Yani Sar Arteu. Colloquially known as simply
    ORE, it has since grown to become the single largest and most influential mining
    conglomerate in the cluster.\n\nFor the first five years of the corporation\u2019s
    existence, business was very difficult. In its fourth year ORE almost declared
    bankruptcy, finding it a challenge to stand out among the many competing mining
    corporations in Verge Vendor. Fortunes changed for the company almost overnight
    in YC 96, however, when a massive obsidian ocher asteroid containing a huge amount
    of nocxium was discovered during a routine survey deployment. The asteroid was
    reportedly the largest single deposit of nocxium ever discovered in New Eden,
    with some sources claiming that it was closer in size to a dwarf planet or a small
    moon.\n\nThis discovery prompted the Gallente government to issue a demand for
    its location, believing that the value of the asteroid was too high for a single
    small corporation. The federation offered a below-market price for the mineral
    value, leaving Arteu with a decision to either sell the asteroid\u2019s location
    to the federation for a safe but reduced profit or rebuke their offers and attempt
    to have ORE work by itself through all aspects of the asteroid\u2019s harvesting.\n\nArteu
    ultimately decided to keep the whereabouts of the asteroid to himself and his
    small inner circle. Along with a highly trusted group of technicians, he began
    work on breaking down the asteroid, keeping its location secret all the while.
    Rather than strip mine the location, the corporation decided to carefully extract
    the ore and slowly release it to the market, in an effort to avoid crashing the
    price of nocxium. Operations were further hampered as the Gallente government
    repeatedly placed economic restrictions on the corporation in an effort to force
    it to release the location of the deposits.\n\nAfter growing pressure was placed
    on the corporation by the federal administration, and a number of sabotage and
    espionage attempts were made on the corporation by competitors, Arteu relocated
    ORE\u2019s operations to Outer Ring, removing the ability of the Gallente Federation
    to place pressure on corporate operations. From this point on, the organization
    flourished and began to grow rapidly into the powerhouse it has become today.\n\nWhile
    Outer Ring Excavations remains a wholly independent corporation, it maintains
    strong ties with highvolume manufacturing corporations across the cluster, as
    well as most of the major commercial shipyards in New Eden."

- body: "## Corporations\n\n### Outer Ring Excavations\nA filthy rich corporation
    that disassociated itself from the Federation when it tried to encroach on the
    companies riches. ORE operates mainly in the Outer Ring and Cloud Ring regions,
    where they have mining installations scattered around in hidden locations, grinding
    out the most valuable minerals on the market. \n\n### Outer Ring Development\nORE\u2019s
    research efforts in fields as diverse as moon mining and space colonization have
    brought the mining conglomerate many innovations over the years since it broke
    with the Gallente Federation. In its efforts to become ever more independent,
    ORE has assembled its most far-thinking, radical and slightly eccentric minds
    in a new division incorporated as Outer Ring Development. Persistent rumors of
    a program to create a genetically-modified Fedo capable of digesting Dark Ochre
    and excreting pure Nocxium have neither been confirmed nor denied.\n\n### Outer
    Ring Prospecting\nOriginating as a branch dedicated to exploring deep space and
    laying claim to anything valuable found therein, Outer Ring Prospecting was eventually
    spun into a separate company in the ORE family. It is rumored to be staffed with
    hungry-looking people who tend to feel uncomfortable in crowds and spend a lot
    of time glancing out the windows of their ships, as if searching for something
    important just out of sight.\n\n### ORE Technologies\nThe increasing involvement
    of ORE in the development of technology and businesses beyond its mining operations
    origins led the conglomerate to set up ORE Technologies as an umbrella corporation
    to co-ordinate and control its various research and product development subsidiaries.\n\n###
    Frostline Laboratories\nORE began to market ice-mining related products under
    its Frostline brand at the end of YC117. The success of the brand's flagship Endurance
    class expedition frigate encouraged ORE to set up a subsidiary corporation to
    manage research and development of new products for the ice-mining industry.\n"
