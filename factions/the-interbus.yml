    The InterBus is used by the SCC to ferry goods between stations, as they are reliable
    and operate in every station in the world. As InterBus has to operate not only
    in empire stations, but also in pirate havens and other stations associated with
    organized crime, the company has to uphold a very strict policy regarding neutrality
    and secrecy.


    Even if the company is owned by the empires, no information regarding to shipments
    or station locations is ever given out. The strict adherence to these rules has
    allowed InterBus to operate without harassment in every corner of the world of
    EVE, making them one of the pillars of the inter-stellar community.'

- body: "## Interbus\n\nInterbus is an impartial freighter company jointly owned by
    the empires. Set up to ferry passengers and goods to and from any corner of the
    cluster, it has been extremely careful to maintain its neutrality in every aspect
    of business. It possesses the finest stellar-mapping systems and station data
    of any organization in the cluster by means of easy access to information from
    all of the major empires. Shipping routes and customer confidentiality are guarded
    with an almost obsessive level of security.\n\nFormed a little over forty years
    ago, the corporation was intended to facilitate interstellar passenger transportation\u2014a
    field with colossal startup costs and a notoriously low rate of return on investment.
    With joint funding from all the empires, Interbus swiftly grew into a large conglomerate
    offering both passenger and large-volume cargo hauling services with no political
    or economic bias.\n\nToday, the setup costs of such a business have vastly diminished.
    Many of the empires have set up their own corporations, such as Imperial Shipment,
    Prompt Delivery, Freedom Extension, and Inner Zone Shipping. Despite these new
    competitors, however, Interbus still enjoys the largest market share by a sizable
    margin.\n\nAs part of its charter, Interbus pledges to offer service to any station
    or outpost, and in order to do so effectively, the corporation must tread a fine
    line between serving various governments faithfully and at the same time establishing
    trust with new and growing settlements and stations. The board of directors for
    Interbus has successfully managed to stay clear of the quarrels and conflicts
    of the various factions within New Eden, with the resulting neutrality meaning
    that while its services aren\u2019t welcomed everywhere with open arms, it\u2019s
    perceived as a service useful enough to be permitted to operate in peace.\n\nThe
    Interbus system, which spans almost the whole of the cluster, is one of the cheapest
    and most reliable forms of transport available. It also operates as a neutral
    safety net for those travelers who find themselves in trouble: many careless merchants
    and explorers who have found themselves stranded among strange stars attribute
    their safe return home to Interbus."

    ### InterBus

    InterBus is jointly owned by the empires, but it has been careful to maintain
    its neutrality in all aspects. This has allowed the company to fulfill its intended
    role as a freighter company that ferries people and goods to and from any place
    in the world of EVE. InterBus has the best stellar charts and station data of
    anyone, but they guard this information very carefully.'
