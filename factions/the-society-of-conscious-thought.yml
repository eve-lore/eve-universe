- body: "## Society of Conscious Thought\n\nThe Society of Conscious Thought, known
    more frequently as SoCT or simply the Society, was founded three centuries ago
    by the Jovian scholar Ior Labron with the objective of discovering nothing less
    than the meaning of existence.\n\nWhile Jovian society in general is not at all
    spiritually inclined, expression of individuality and personality are highly encouraged
    to assist with cognitive development, and as such those who take to spiritual
    enlightenment tend to do so with a good deal of vigor. Through the ages the Society
    has acted as one of the largest outlets for the spiritual needs of the Jove, although
    today that role has become secondary.\n\nBeginning life originally as a cult,
    the Society evolved into a political organization before effectively becoming
    a shadow government. This situation did not persist for very long. A number of
    political entities joined forces to break down the Society\u2019s power base,
    resulting in its operations being made illegal. The organization lived on in obscurity,
    however, falling back to its quasi-mystical quest for the meaning of life.\n\nSeveral
    decades later, the Society began again to assert itself, this time in a far more
    careful manner, which ensured that it simply skirted the edge of a political arena
    that was now extremely hostile. As the Society evolved, its attention turned away
    from politics and toward education. Preferring to keep its residences and refuges
    in remote areas, away from civilization and large human settlements, it began
    to open schools and set up minisocieties emphasizing self-sufficiency, a trait
    strongly encouraged among the Jove.\n\nThese sprawling places, known as \u201Ckitzes\u201D
    and often resembling huge fortresses, still exist today and house everything from
    living quarters and food-growing facilities to laboratories and libraries. Each
    is a separate entity, but communication between kitzes is frequent and each one
    maintains a school for educating its members in the scholarly or scientific fields.\n\nInitially
    all students were children of Society members, but several decades ago the Society
    started allowing admittance to a small number of outside children each year. More
    recently the Society has even allowed a select few non-Jove children to attend.
    Applicants are chosen by the Society, their choices seeming to many almost random,
    with no visible pattern as to who gets in: race, gender, social standing, or even
    talent and intelligence by themselves do not seem to play instrumental roles.\n\nMany
    wealthy parents have tried to increase their child\u2019s chances by donating
    large sums of money to the Society, but statistically this appears to have little
    or no effect. In any case, most people agree that the education the children receive
    within the Society\u2019s walls is first class; every graduate is a sought-after
    employee anywhere he or she goes. An astonishing proportion of Society graduates
    reach a prominent position later in life, becoming presidents of multistellar
    corporations or governmental ministers. It remains unsurprising, therefore, that
    people regard the Society\u2019s schools as breeding grounds for world leaders."

    ### Society of Conscious Thought

    The Society was formed several centuries ago by a Jovian as a spiritual institution.
    Since then it has taken on many guises, but today it is mainly known for its excellent
    schools, which it operates in remote areas around space. These schools are considered
    the best in the world of EVE and parents everywhere fight to get their children
    admitted.


    ### Genolution

    Genolution is the leading cloning company in the world of EVE. Not only was it
    the first company to start offering clones to the public, but since then it has
    improved the cloning technique considerably, paving the way for others to follow
    in their footsteps.


    In YC118, operation of Genolution was transferred from the Jovian Directorate
    to the Society of Conscious Thought.


    ### Impro

    Impro is a small hi-tech company that is one of the few Jovian companies to operate
    outside Jove space. It manufactures mainly electronic hardware, far superior to
    those produced by the other empires.


    In YC118, operation of Impro was transferred from the Jovian Directorate to the
    Society of Conscious Thought.


    ### X-Sense

    X-Sense manufacture medical equipment that it sells all over the world of EVE.
    When neural boosters were legal X-Sense was also one of the leaders in that field,
    though it naturally stopped producing them once they became illegal.


    In YC118, operation of X-Sense was transferred from the Jovian Directorate to
    the Society of Conscious Thought.
