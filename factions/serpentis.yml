    At first it was engaged in hi-tech research, but with time its ties with the underworld
    grew and the Serpentis research stations, scattered around in remote areas, became

    in peace and the Angel Cartel gets access to the illegal research efforts of the
    Serpentis.


    It is strongly believed that Serpentis is the main developer and manufacturer
    of illegal neural boosters, especially since Sarpati''s father was a renown specialist
    in that field. The home of Serpentis is in the Phoenix constellation in the Fountain
    region.'

    The Serpentis Corporation is a cutting-edge research, development, and manufacturing
    corporation specializing in biochemistry and the production and distribution of
    high-technology pharmaceuticals. To put it more bluntly, Serpentis is one of the
    foremost manufacturers and smugglers of illegal drugs in New Eden. Concentrating
    primarily on the lucrative Gallente Federation market, Serpentis networks ship
    neural boosters and other drugs across the cluster in vast quantities every day.
    As a major source of illegal drugs and the crime associated with them, the Serpentis
    are high on the priority list of criminal organizations monitored by law enforcement
    in New Eden.


    While Serpentis networks uncovered in the core empires are more or less readily
    dealt with by the authorities, the one advantage that the Serpentis Corporation
    holds over many other drug syndicates is its control of the Phoenix constellation
    of systems in the outer region of Fountain. Over the years, the Serpentis have
    established many subsidiary facilities and installations in neighboring regions
    and the hidden folds of deadspace. Their alliance with the Angel Cartel has brought
    them both additional security and a foothold in the Curse region, where they have
    many manufacturing and storage stations. From their well-protected bases in nullsec
    space, the Serpentis are able to control a large portion of the illegal booster
    market with little concern for the forces of law and order.'

    ### Serpentis Corporation

    The Serpentis Corporation was initially a Gallentean research firm that evolved
    into a drug cartel. The Serpentis Corporation is believed to be the biggest producer
    and distributor of illegal neural boosters. They have employed the Guardian Angels
    to protect their assets in space.


    ### Serpentis Inquest

    Serpentis Inquest is a offspring of the Serpentis Corporation that is also a research
    company, but instead of focusing on neural boosters Inquest is researching black
    cyber implants and alternative cloning methods.'
