    The Blood Raiders are a sect of an ancient cult called [Sani Sabik](TDJbDXVg3cRp4b6FEkkFS),
    which uses blood in their rituals. The Blood Raiders believe that cloned bodies
    have ''purer'' blood than other bodies and this explains why they operate mainly
    in space, attacking unwary space farers and draining their bodies of blood.


    The Blood Raiders are led by the fearsome [Omir Sarikusa](6UYaNpBPqY1ls1ps78PPPt),
    who has remained at the top of the DED''s most wanted list for many years now.
    Under his leadership the Blood Raiders have become more organized and they have
    established several bases in the Bleak Lands region.'

- body: "## The Blood Raiders\n\nRegarded as one of the most frightening groups in
    the cluster, second in most people\u2019s eyes only to the never-ending scourge
    of Sansha\u2019s Nation, the Blood Raider Covenant has gained a reputation as
    one of the most savage forces an individual can cross paths with in New Eden.
    It is a particularly well-known sect of an ancient cult by the name of [Sani Sabik](TDJbDXVg3cRp4b6FEkkFS),
    which literally translates to \u201Cblood seed.\u201D Under the leadership of
    the legendary Sabik priest [Omir Sarikusa](6UYaNpBPqY1ls1ps78PPPt), they have
    made their way into the minds of the general populace as perennial bogeymen, people
    of tainted minds and ghastly appetites.\n\nThe Sani Sabik cult first appeared
    thousands of years ago on Amarr Prime as a schismatic sect of the Amarrian faith,
    long before the advent of space travel. This sect\u2019s guiding belief was that
    some people were born for greatness, and other people lived only to breed and
    serve these exalted few. To this, they added the obsession with eternal life that
    permeates the upper tiers of the Amarrian elite, and the result was a cult so
    pervasive and destructive that Amarrian religious authorities immediately stamped
    down on it. Depleted but not defeated, the sect lived on in the shadows, every
    so often mutating itself anew. Today the cult exists in a multitude of independent
    sects throughout the Amarr Empire, with some even having moved their business
    to other empires or out into neutral space.\n\nAt some undocumented point in their
    history, the Sani Sabik began using blood in their rituals, and though each of
    the different sects of the cult varies in their rituals and doctrine, blood is
    always the focal point of their search for immortality. A few sects have taken
    \u201Cblooding\u201D\u2014as they call the draining of blood from a body\u2014to
    new heights. Rumors exist of \u201Cblood farms,\u201D where people are kept against
    their will, their blood regularly harvested. Other stories tell of sects that
    engage in necrophilic and even cannibalistic activities. As little is known of
    the inner workings of most of the sects, it is difficult to say whether these
    stories are true or just urban legends.\n\nBefore Omir Sarikusa took leadership
    of the covenant, the sect was already infamous for killing children, who were
    considered to have \u201Cpurer\u201D blood. Omir added to this practice by beginning
    to target those who were [clones](5y5CUyA9h4xXY40dInhn3o), believing their blood
    better suited for their arcane blood rituals.\n\nIn their search for cloned people,
    Omir\u2019s sect has taken to space. In the time since, their frequent attacks
    on passenger ships and other space vessels have made them feared and hated across
    the entire cluster. While the fact that they originated within the Amarr Empire
    is still a sore point for the Amarr (and rarely brought up in conversation), the
    covenant do not return the Amarr\u2019s hatred. Instead, they are inclined to
    view them as believers who have been led astray, faithful who could realize their
    true potential if they could only accept the true uncompromising and savage nature
    of their own faith.\n\nThe fact is that the Sani Sabik doctrine still shares a
    substantial number of beliefs with the Amarrian faith. It simply applies a different
    approach, paying particular attention to a number of scriptural passages that
    the Amarr would just as soon gloss over."

    ### Blood Raiders

    The Blood Raiders evolved from an ancient Amarrian cult into a gang of cut-throat
    bandits that revel in killing and maiming. They are considered among the most
    dangerous and depraved of all pirate elements operating in space. CONCORD strongly
    advises people to stay out of their zones in the Bleak Lands.'
