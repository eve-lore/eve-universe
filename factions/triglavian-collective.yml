- body: "## Corporations\n\nThe Triglavian Collective has a complex social structure
    that is not easy for outsiders to understand on the strength of the limited observations
    made so far. One important element of the civilization is the so-called 'Clades',
    which clearly play a vital role in all aspects of the Collective.\n\n### The Convocation
    of Triglav\n\nThe Convocation of Triglav Outside the Struggle appears to be a
    central organizing body for the Triglavian Collective. Data recovered from Triglavian
    structures and wreckage indicates that the Perun, Svarog, and Veles Clades are
    all represented in the Convocation.\n\n### Perun Clade\nThe Perun Clade seems
    to be made up of many subclades and appears to be accomplished in space-time mechanics,
    high-impulse and FTL engine construction, and electronic systems. The Perun Clade
    apparently exerts itself in the sphere of strategic leadership of the Collective
    to a greater degree than others.\n\n### Svarog Clade\nThe Svarog Clade is apparently
    made up of many subclades and the evidence so far indicates strengths in combat
    vessel construction, the development of novel weapon systems and extensive use
    of bioadaptive mutaplasmid technology. The Svarog Clade seems the most aggressive
    and traditional, while inclined to explore new opportunities.\n\n### Veles Clade\nThe
    Veles Clade seems to be made up of many subclades and is seemingly very strong
    in the fields of heavy space industry, communications technology and high-energy
    exotic particle physics. The Veles Clade seems to prize discourse and diplomacy,
    after a fashion, over strife \u2013 that is, if the evidence has been understood
    correctly.\n\n### Navka Overminds\nThe Navka Overminds are a form of rogue drone
    swarm that can be encountered in significant numbers throughout Abyssal Deadspace
    wherever Triglavian infrastructure is present. The designation 'Navka' seems to
    have some relationship to a subdivision of the Triglavian race that runs across
    the so-called 'clades'.\n\nIt would seem that the Navka Overminds are either entirely
    suborned to Triglavian purposes or, perhaps more worryingly, are willingly working
    with them.\n"
