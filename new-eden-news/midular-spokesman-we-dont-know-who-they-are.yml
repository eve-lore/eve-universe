- body: "Illuin - A spokesman for Minmatar Republic Prime Minister Karin Midular firmly
    denounced any involvement with the mystery fleet which threatened CONCORD Bureau
    Station in Yulai. \"The location of every ship in the Republic Fleet at the time
    of the armada's incursion has been accounted for,\" he announced. \"Although those
    ships were clearly of Minmatar design, we just don't know who they are or what
    their intentions were.\" \n\nWhen asked about Ambassador Keitan Yun's alleged
    involvement with the mysterious fleet, he stated only that such claims have \"very
    serious implications for Mr. Yun which are yet to be verified\", and that \"under
    no conceivable circumstances would Premier Midular authorize or endorse any threat
    against CONCORD.\" \n\nKarin Midular is facing increased scrutiny following a
    string of embarrassing incidents which have weakened her premiership, most recently
    the \"annexation\" of the Skarkon System by the Angel Cartel."
