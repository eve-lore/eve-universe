- body: While Sukuuvesta Corporation has been in the spotlight these last few days
    because of the Protein Delicacies scandal, it has until now kept quiet about the
    whole thing. Yesterday they spoke for the first time about the matter. That Protein
    Delicacies are made from garbage was not mentioned at all. Instead, a scathing
    attack was made on the Quafe company for their unethical industrial espionage.
    An agent working for Quafe managed to breach the security of the Sukuuvestaa Corporation
    and infiltrate one of its factories. Sukuuvestaa says this is industrial espionage
    of the worst sort, its main intention was to steal the manufacturing process for
    the Protein Delicacies. Quafe has refused to comment on the matter, but the Caldari
    are threatening to take it up within the halls of CONCORD. Thus, a whole new dimension
    of inter-stellar conflict as result of the scandal may be brewing.
