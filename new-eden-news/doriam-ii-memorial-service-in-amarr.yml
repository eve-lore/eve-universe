    Doriam II, the Curatores Veritatis Alliance hosted a Memorial Service at the Emperor
    Family Station in Amarr.   \n  \nAmongst the about 175 attending were pilots from
    both the Curatores Veritatis and Aegis Milita Alliances as well as numerous loyal
    Amarr citizens. But not only amarrians had gathered to honour their late emperor
    - among the attendees were also Hellcore, Cold Lazarus, Derran and Sarkos from
    Ushra\u2019Khan, who all were granted at temporary amnesty.   \n  \nThe Memorial
    Service was led by CVA Vice-Admiral Ethidium Bromide, who described the untimely
    passing of emperor Doriam II as \u201CGod\u2019s ways are not for us mortals to
    understand\u201D. Following his words PIE forces fired salutes before Lord Niviss
    of the Imperial Chancellor\u2019s office spoke to the pilots present.   \n  \nDuring
    his speech Lord Niviss called Doriam the second \u201C a man of single-minded
    vision and a man of the people, maintaining the sage teaching of his predecessor
    to create a world that would benefit ALL within the confines of the Empire\u201D
    and a \u201Cdivine example for all Amarrians\u201D. With the identity of the emperor\u2019s
    assailants still unknown, Lord Niviss referred to them as \u201Cdespicable transgressors
    that have portrayed this lowest and debased of crimes - a hunted existence cumulating
    in a befitting end shall be their reward. They shall prove a fitting example for
    all those who wish to defy imperial decree.\u201D Concluding his speech he urged
    the attendees to \u201Ccome together in joyous prayer in memory of our great Emperor.
    Let his life be an example to all, and may he courage and inspirational leadership
    be an example for generations to come - Amen\u201D   \n  \nFollowing Lord Niviss\u2019
    speech and outbursts of grief and loyalty to the Amarr Empire by numerous pilots,
    CVA forces warped to the Amarrian Monument at the third planet to kneel and pray.
    Upon their return Vice Admiral Ethidium Bromide was available for a few questions.
    \  \n  \n\u201CNow, as the service is over, what are your thoughts?\u201D   \n
    \ \n\u201CMy personal thoughts are that it was an impressive ceremony and I can
    only hope I did it just. I am impressed with the number of loyal citizens, outside
    the CVA, and guests who attended it. It was also good to see, that some of our
    enemies have shown up and payed their respect. I would also like to thank Lord
    Niviss and the Imperial Chancellor for upgrading this memorial service with his
    presence.\u201D   \n  \n\u201CWith respect to the presence of people you under
    normal circumstances consider as enemies. Do you know how many attended and could
    you explain why you allowed them to attend the service?\u201D   \n  \n\u201CI
    counted six of them at the Emperor Station, four from Masuat'aa matari and two
    from RCS Assault Squad. We decided to put a temporary cease fire into effect for
    Amarr, when representatives of those two corporations had expressed their wish
    to pay their respect to Doriam II today. They have often earned our respect on
    the battlefield and although they are enemies their presence shows that they are
    honourable and that not all hope for the Matari people is lost.\u201D"
