    program of aid to assist the overstretched Ishukone Corporation, following the
    disaster in Malkalen. Hyasyoda, a long-time partner of Ishukone in the so-called
    'Liberal Faction', will provide emergency enabling loans to Ishukone Corporation
    and direct relief aid to Malkalen system.\n\n\"The Hyasyoda Corporation will not
    stand by and see a great megacorporation of the Caldari State fall to an act of
    treachery and unprovoked aggression. We are therefore making funds available at
    preferential rates so that the Ishukone executives who survive can continue to
    run their organisation and oversee the relief efforts. We are also sending relief
    ships to the Malkalen system to directly assist the efforts at the Ishukone Headquarters,\"
    said Ahtonen Osmon.\n\nOsmon went on to emphasise that Hyasyoda would work with
    any megacorporation in defence of the Caldari State, \"It is true that we of Hyasyoda
    have our particular view of business and the best means by which the Caldari people
    can better themselves. In this the Ishukone are our friends but all Caldari are
    our concern. We are clear that the Caldari State, the corporations and the people
    must be unified in defence against those who have so often sought to destroy our
    way of life. If there are any in the Gallente Federation who believe we will not
    fight as hard and as ruthlessly as our great forebears, then I say that they are
    gravely mistaken.\"\n\n\"In closing, while it has often been said that we in Hyasyoda
    are too cautious, we maintain that, as the old saying goes, 'Only the paranoid
    survive.'\""
