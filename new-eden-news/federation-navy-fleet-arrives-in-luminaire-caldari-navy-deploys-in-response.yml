- body: 'BREAKING NEWS - A large task force of Federation Navy capital-class vessels
    arrived in Luminaire moments ago, triggering a similar escalation from the Caldari
    Navy.


    The exact composition of the Gallente fleet is still unknown at this time, although
    local magnetometric scans are rumored to display the signatures of dozens of capital-class
    vessels. Within seconds of the Federation Navy''s arrival, a sizable Caldari Navy
    fleet bridged into Luminaire from the border system of Kassigainen before the
    Federation Navy could reactivate its cynosural jamming systems.


    The Caldari Navy fleet, consisting of a wing of Phoenix-class dreadnoughts and
    Chimera-class carriers, has made immediate contact with the _Shiigeru_ and her
    support fleet in low orbit of Caldari Prime, setting up a defensive perimeter
    around their flagship.


    At this time, the Federation Navy fleet remains concealed and has not yet made
    any advance on Caldari Prime. Federation Navy cynosural jamming systems are back
    on line, however, a development which has effectively cut off the Caldari fleet
    from further escalation.'
