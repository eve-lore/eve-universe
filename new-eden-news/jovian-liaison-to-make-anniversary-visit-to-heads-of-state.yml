- body: "The Jovian Directorate today issued a press release to all major news agencies
    throughout the universe. The release states that Misu Baniya, Extra-Racial Liaison
    for the Jove Directorate, will tomorrow, over the course of only one hour, make
    diplomatic visits to President Foiritan of the Gallente Federation, Amarr Emperor
    Kor-Azor, PM Midular of the Minmatar Republic, and the headquarters of the Caldari
    State\u2019s Chief Executive Panel, as well as \u201Cother factional leaders,
    heretofore unrecognized by the diplomatic community at large.\u201D   \n  \nAs
    stated in the release, the visit is intended to commemorate tomorrow\u2019s one-year
    anniversary of the founding of the Interstellar Services Division, the multi-corp,
    multi-racial conglomerate which many believe has been the biggest contributor
    to the vast increase in the number of pilots traversing the spacelanes this last
    year, and which, according to the release, \u201Chas worked wonders in stimulating
    economic and social growth throughout the universe.\u201D   \n  \nBaniya himself
    was instrumental in founding and setting up the ISD, helping get the giant multi-billion
    ISK project off the ground. He became known by associates for his deft touch at
    dispute mediation and calm detachment in times of crisis.   \n  \nBaniya\u2019s
    visit will also be used as an opportunity to utilize the Jovians\u2019 latest
    state-of-the-art technological marvel, a new form of transportation. The release\u2019s
    wording is cryptic when describing this piece of equipment, but judging by the
    sheer number of visits Baniya intends to make in only one hour \u2013 and the
    distances involved between them \u2013 it looks to be something quite special
    indeed.   \n  \nHalls of government everywhere have already begun preparations
    for the liaison\u2019s arrival. He is expected to arrive at his first stop, New
    Caldari, at 12:00 EVT tomorrow."
