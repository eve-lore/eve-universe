- body: '_Luminaire - _Several clashes occurred along borders between [Gallente](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente)\-
    and [Caldari](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari)-held districts on [Caldari
    Prime](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Prime) over the weekend, but
    were swiftly dealt with by [Mordu''s Legion](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Mordu''s
    Legion). According to reports, the clashes were sparked by the revelation that
    the Federation government has been spying on Caldari corporations.


    The disturbances seem to have originated with exchanges of insults between Caldari
    and Gallente and escalated from there. Individuals or small groups soon swelled
    to small mobs on both sides. It remains uncertain which side initiated the violence,
    but both sides are reported to have engaged in crossing of borders to attack members
    of the opposite side.


    Mordu''s Legion, the neutral police force agreed upon by both the Caldari and
    Gallente governments, stepped in on each occasion to put a halt to the violence
    shortly after it began. The Legion deployed non-lethal riot suppression weaponry
    to disperse the crowds and arrested several individuals in connection with the
    violence.


    According to official reports, all injuries have been minor, including a broken
    wrist of a Mannar man who resisted arrest and a Civire woman who broke her hand
    striking a Mordu''s Legion officer in a dropsuit.


    Administrative officials for the districts were quick to praise Mordu''s Legion
    for their handling of the situation, saying, "This had the potential to grow much
    larger, but the professional and even-handed intervention of Mordu''s Legion seems
    to have averted that."'
