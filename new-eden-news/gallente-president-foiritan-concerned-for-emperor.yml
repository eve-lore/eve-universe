- body: The Federation's President, Souro Foiritan, is reportedly gravely concerned
    about developments within the Amarr Empire, where Emperor Heideran VII has remained
    out of sight for days. Yesterday the President appeared before the Senate to discuss
    budgetary issues, but he took the opportunity to discuss the situation within
    the Amarr Empire. President Foiritan did not hide his admiration for the Emperor,
    which he described as having 'dragged the world kicking and screaming from a state
    of perpetual petty rivalries to a state of peace and prosperity.' He continued
    by saying that the Emperor was a 'shining beacon of light guiding us to safer
    havens and that if this light would go out we would be lost in this dark and turbulent
    sea that is inter-stellar relations.' Flowery words indeed, but political analysts
    tend to agree with the statements made by the president. President Foiritan nevertheless
    remained optimistic that Emperor Heideran would reemerge soon stronger than ever,
    and that his message of amity would resound throughout the civilized world for
    eternity.
