- body: "Safizon - The Imperial Navy is ending its exploration of wormhole space,
    citing the lack of immediate threat from Sleeper drones on Empire assets as well
    as difficulty with coordinating large fleets on exploration efforts.   \n  \nThe
    Amarr Navy first began sending fleets through the wormholes shortly after they
    began appearing throughout New Eden. The fleets frequently encountered Sleeper
    Drones and suffered losses, though the Navy has not been forthcoming with casualty
    numbers.   \n  \n\"The Navy is cautiously withdrawing from wormhole space,\" read
    the official statement released by the Navy. \"We are confident that wormhole
    space does not pose any immediate threat to the Empire and it is currently a matter
    of scientific interest rather than military concern. The Imperial Navy will continue
    to research artifacts brought back from wormhole space, but our resources are
    best concentrated in other areas, such as protecting our current territory from
    the Empire's many enemies.\"  \n  \nThe statement went on to urge continued exploration
    by capsuleers, particularly those loyal to the Amarr Empire. \"We feel that loyalist
    capsuleers are far more equipped to deal with the constantly shifting circumstances
    of wormhole space. The Empire will be well served by their continued exploration
    and exploitation of this new frontier.\""
