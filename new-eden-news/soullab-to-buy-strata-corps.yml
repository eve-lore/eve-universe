- body: "NEW CALDARI. The Executive Board of Strata Corp is reviewing a take-over
    offer from its Gallente rival Soullier Laboratories. \n\nThe offer for 57% of
    SC's shares, at 45.37 per share, was formally presented last Thursday to the surprise
    of every market analyst in The Forge, [after Strata Corp's success to regain market
    share](http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=1071&tid=6) previously
    lost to SoulLab. SC's acquisition was launched \"as part of our expansion strategy
    in the Caldari transmitter market, and was being planned for quite some time\",
    explained Mr Will Baze, CEO of Soullier Laboratories. \n\nStrata Corp's Executive
    Board has not reached a decision about SoulLab's offer, yet analysts are confident
    it will be accepted. According to Mr. Baze, \"SoulLab's board took long ago the
    decision to aggressively expand into the Caldari market, and buying one of the
    smaller Caldari high-tech companies was always a possibility to be considered.
    The success SC showed in the past few weeks speaks of a solid corporation and
    motivated personnel; absorbing SC into SoulLab will allow us to expand our distribution
    channels in The Forge.\" Mr. Baze declined to comment if other Caldari corporations
    had been considered as an alternative, and whether or not Strata Corp will be
    the first of many. \n\nDavid Simmons, actual CEO of Strata Corp, is said to be
    \"devastated\" by the news, according to SC's CFO Jenny Civ. \"David took this
    manoeuvre a bit too personal, I'm afraid\", said Ms. Civ. \"After successfully
    managing to pull SC out of the red and regain our lost market share from Gallente
    competition, it is a harsh blow to suddenly be confronted with the possibility
    of having your competitor as owner and President of the board.\" \n\nAnaiolen
    Oruvei, Public Relations for SoulLab, confirmed previous rumours that production
    will still be centred in the Gallente Federation. \"Our Strategic Plan calls for
    selling Strata Corp's Manufacture Division, as a means to finance part of the
    purchase, and keep importing the products directly from our Fed-based factories.\"
    According to Mr. Oruvei, a number of possible purchasers of the Manufacture Division
    have already been contacted. \n\nThe answer from Strata Corp's Board is expected
    to be officially announced during next week."
