- body: "PLACID. New perspectives and incidents have come to light following the release
    a fortnight ago of a lethal virus, responsible for the deaths of many aboard a
    station in Stacmon. Involved parties such as the Star Fraction have sought to
    clear their name after becoming embroiled in controversy surrounding their destruction
    of a Sisters of Eve escort seeking to limit the damage caused. At the same time,
    new information has surfaced about the nature of the virus and potential cures.
    \n\nWidely known for their often radical and stubborn views regarding posthuman
    philosophy, the Star Fraction have recently been heavily criticized from many
    sides, joining enemies together in their accusations of recklessness and disregard
    for life, and even drawing strong words from Sister Rhayne of the SSOE, an organization
    previously thought to be on excellent terms with the Fraction. The motivation
    behind such criticism has stemmed from their involvement in the destruction of
    a Mordus Legion escort, hired by the SSOE to aid them against the continued release
    of the Order of Medusa virus. \n\nResponding to the allegations, Star Fraction
    Executor Jade Constantine referenced previous events in the Pure Blind region
    explaining: \u201CStar Fraction and Mordu's have a history of bad standings going
    back over a year\u2026we informed Sister Rhayne that a situation of hostility
    existed\u2026and while we stood off to allow the scientific mission to reach its
    conclusion we were not going to hold fire on the Mordu's vessel indefinitely\u2026when
    his warning period was up we destroyed him.\u201D Referencing the Razor Alliance,
    Ms Constantine further stated: \u201CPeople have a right to know why a humanitarian
    organization seeking to relieve the suffering of disaster victims would league
    itself with an NBSI-class brigand power in Pure Blind\u2026 [the] Sisters of Eve
    need to be called on it.\u201D\n\nMeanwhile, an SSOE ship was cleared from quarantine
    at Stacmon after it was determined by Gallente Federation officials that the biomass
    samples they retrieved from the Hedoubel incident posed no current risk with all
    of the biological pathogens identified as dead and inert. Sister Rhayne then appealed
    to the capsuleer community for assistance in relocating half of the biomass samples
    to their Sanctuary station in X-7OMU for further independent study into it's origins
    and a vaccine or cure. \n\nPreliminary analysis in Stacmon by Federate officials
    indicated a high probability that the virus was designed and manufactured. \"What
    occurred in Hedoubel may have been a simple test,\" said one of the Federation
    scientists overseeing the study. \n\nNumerous capsuleers were eager to assist
    the Sisters of EVE, but members of The Star Fraction Alliance once again involved
    themselves, intruding on the meeting with their demands. Star Fraction pilots
    refused to leave the Sisters of EVE's communication channel at Sister Rhayne's
    request and continually pressed for answers to the decline in relations, effectively
    disrupting the departure of the convoy. \"It darkens my spirit that they would
    place their own egotism and agendas above the safety of countless lives. Never
    did they express any grief or sorrow for the lives lost or any concern for the
    future lives that they may have placed in jeopardy with their actions should they
    result in this biological weapon being used again,\" added Rhayne. \n\nReports
    state that the Star Fraction pilots continued to act in an aggressive manner,
    including targeting Rhayne's ship, attempting to ram her ship from the docking
    ports of the station, and following her ship in warp with their fleet. The Fraction
    denied the claims of aggression, but admitted to scouting the SSOE squad. \u201CWe
    became suspicious of her motives and decided to shadow her convoy ourselves to
    make sure it reached the X-7O base,\u201D stated Ms Constantine, expressing confusion
    at what she perceived was 'peculiar behavior' on Sister Rhayne\u2019s behalf.
    \n\nTheir actions forced the capsuleer pilots escorting the Sister's convoy to
    take an alternative route and switch ships. As they arrived into zero-sec space,
    tensions were raised as the Sister and her escorts jumped into a Star Fraction
    gate camp with an interdiction sphere, assuming hostile intent on the Fraction\u2019s
    behalf. All vessels escaped unscathed and were unharmed however. Star Fraction
    pilots claimed to have stood down, with Ms Constantine stating in clear terms:
    \"No SF vessel engaged the convoy of SSOE and neutral escorts...they were not
    prevented from moving the 15 kilometers\u2026required to take them beyond the
    bubble.\u201D She further claimed that SOE fired the first shot \"without hail
    or provocation.\" \n\nTragedy and actual conflict was not far away however, as
    members of the Band of Brothers fired upon an SSOE agent, destroying her ship
    and pod over a perceived insult. \"Seeker Lillandra declined their escort, as
    she had no reason to trust them and many reasons not to, seeing as they were attacking
    ships that were coming through the gate,\" reported Sister Rhayne. \"I attempted
    to negotiate with their diplomat for a cease of hostilities and the return of
    her cargo, but we were unable to come to a mutual understanding.\" The Sister
    admits further distress over the fate of the Sister Lillandra body, which remains
    in the hands of the pilots who killed her. \n\nSister Rhayne wished to express
    her gratitude to those that came to her aid: \"To the members of the capsuleer
    community that ensured my safe arrival, you have my eternal gratitude and I would
    like to personally thank pilot Killiana Lett of Raddick Explorations for lending
    me her covert-ops vessel. It is rare to see such outright generosity and trust
    among strangers, and such kindness should be treasured for the priceless gift
    that it is.\" \n\nWith the biomass samples safely secured in their station, the
    Sisters of EVE reports that they can get their research project underway. \"We
    will be building a new expansion to our station specifically for genetic and biological
    study,\" says Sister Rhayne. \"We have appealed to several corporations for specialists
    in that area. We remain hopeful that we can develop a cure for this weapon.\""
