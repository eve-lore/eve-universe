- body: "Last month witnessed an unprecedented request from Amarrian capsuleers that
    they be informed as to the progress of the investigation into the assassination
    of Emperor Doriam. Despite serving as a severe breach of protocol, the request
    sparked fervent academic debate within the Empire regarding the next Succession
    championships and what form they will take.   \n  \nWhile no outright dissent
    has been aired on the issue, it is no secret that the people of the Empire are
    growing impatient with the wait for a new Emperor. In an announcement late last
    week, Uriam Kador endorsed the ongoing debate by making his opinions known publicly.
    Here is an excerpt from his statement:   \n  \n\"For too long has our Empire languished
    without an Emperor. It is due time that we, the Heirs, decide how the next Championships
    shall be held, lest we incur God\u2019s wrath for our Chamberlain\u2019s apparent
    lack of will to move forward.\"   \n  \n\"I move that the Championship not be
    fought in the barren byways of the infinite, but rather here on God\u2019s earth,
    by those of pure flesh. We should look not to those who cheat death by shedding
    and donning bodies like discarded rags, for who can tell what happens to the soul
    through its endless leapfrogging from body to body?\"   \n  \n\"We should look
    to true Amarrians, the chosen people of God, barren of the impurities of their
    spacebound kin.\"   \n  \nDr. Emuil Zalaveille, political analyst at the University
    of Caille and an expert on Amarrian affairs, regarded the speech as just the latest
    in a series of affronts to Chamberlain Dokuta Karsoth\u2019s authority.   \n  \n\"His
    [the Chamberlain\u2019s] position has been growing ever weaker in the last months,\"
    said Dr. Zalaveille. \"With the murder investigation yielding no apparent answers
    and the Navy all but directly disobeying his commands to police the Bleak Lands,
    the addition of a royal Heir\u2019s accusation of laxness in the matter of the
    succession comes as no surprise.\""
