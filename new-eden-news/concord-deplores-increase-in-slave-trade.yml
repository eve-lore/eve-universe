- body: CONCORD has released a harsh statement warning against slave trade. The statement
    is in response to persistent rumors that slaves are becoming increasingly popular
    as forced labor throughout the world of EVE. CONCORD wants to remind people that
    slave trade is strictly forbidden everywhere except within Amarr borders and that
    there are harsh penalties for engaging in human trade. CONCORD ships, and other
    police forces, may shoot on sight anyone carrying slaves. The Minmatar Republic
    has also released a statement where they express sadness that the slave trade
    industry seems to be on the rise and encourages people to stop slave trade wherever
    it is found, by any means necessary. The Republic itself has taken a strong stance
    in this and has already attacked and annihilated several slave trader ships.
