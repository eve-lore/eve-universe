    \ \n[Vrael Zann](https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Vrael%20Zann)\n\nThe Scope
    Network's current round of contracts will run for several weeks to come and the
    top ten participants will be rewarded with additional BPCs upon its conclusion.
    Five single-run Vendetta BPCs and five single-run Vanquisher BPCs will be available
    to those who have aided the empires the most and have earned the most points from
    Scope Network contracts.\n\nAs CONCORD re-evaluates the threat level from various
    organizations and entities across New Eden, it is clear that the usefulness of
    the service the Scope Network offers is factoring into their calculations. Sources
    within the DED and the Scope Network have both confirmed that talks between FTL
    comms giant Semiotique Superluminal, the majority shareholder in the Scope Network,
    CONCORD and the Gallente Federation are continuing with a view to defining more
    clearly the operations of the Scope Network."
