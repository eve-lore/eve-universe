- body: "An SCC ruling on disputed patent claims for hull modification technology
    opens the door for the licensing and manufacture of devices based on the controversial
    research. Boundless Creations, one of the companies involved in the settlement,
    wasted no time today in releasing a schematic for the production of a device utilizing
    the research breakthroughs. Due to SCC regulations regarding arbitration of patent
    claims disputes, the identities of the other corporations or individuals involved
    in the settlement remain secret, but it is only a matter of time before more licensed
    schematics appear.   \n  \nIn a statement from their headquarters at Hagilur IV
    Moon 3, Chief Researcher Bogekur Alpur announced the release of the schematic
    and praised the efforts of the Boundless Creation employee who made it possible,
    as well as giving credit to the licensee of the first schematic based on this
    research. \"Through the joint efforts of our own Adrald Evalfolf and Korinn Feald
    of X-Factor Industries, the general public will now be able to enjoy the benefits
    of our research into the field of starship modification.\"   \n  \nBoundless Creation
    (ticker: BC), a relatively diminutive new Minmatar manufacturing corporation,
    has specialized in research facilities, building several in the Metropolis region
    of Minmatar space, including the Boundless Creation Factory at Hek VIII Moon 12
    where this schematic was released. Investment in the fledgling company by the
    Krusual and Brutor tribes, as well as by the majority-Krusual owned Freedom Extension
    (ticker: FE), has apparently paid off.   \n  \nThe technology will allow starship
    pilots to gain interior ship space at the expense of overall speed and some structural
    integrity. These modifications, bearing the SCC-approved designation \"Expanded
    Cargohold I,\" require only limited training to install, and allow for significant
    increases in cargo carrying capacity.   \n  \nDue to the long-standing dispute
    over intellectual property rights, this technology has never been officially approved
    for licensing and manufacture application, but an earlier version of the schematics
    were apparently stolen by criminal organizations believed to be operating in the
    Lonetrek region. These criminals subsequently manufactured small quantities of
    the Expanded Cargohold I modifications, which later found their way to market
    in small quantities. Though not officially acknowledging the existing \"grey market
    trade\" in so-called \"pirate mods,\" Bogekur Alpur did say, \"previous versions
    of these schematics have significant flaws in the production process algorithms,
    resulting in considerable component wastage during construction.\" He went on
    to say, \"Modification modules produced by these officially approved schematics
    take advantage of much more refined and elegant manufacture processes, and should
    therefore be much more economical.\"   \n  \nThe SCC, as is their custom, declined
    to comment on the successful arbitration of the issue, and as yet no other corporation
    has released schematics based on this technology. However, now that the SCC decision
    has legalized \"trade and manufacture of the technology and subsequent devices
    based upon same,\" as the official arbitration notice states, it is certain that
    additional licensing of this technology is only days away"
