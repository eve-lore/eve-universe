- body: "Recent news reports have been flooding in from various anonymous sources
    of attacks at the fringes of Caldari space.   \n  \nFor the past few months these
    mysterious attacks have been on the rise and they do not appear to be letting
    up. Each of the attacks appears to contain a small tightly nit fleet of eight
    or so Caldari ships, enlisted in an oddly named corporation. Every attempt at
    communication with any of these vessels is met with garbled and seemingly random
    noise. Early attempts at decrypting the signals have failed but cryptologists
    are still working on decoding fragments of communications submitted by pilots
    who have encountered them.   \n  \nOnly tonight a group of these mysterious vessels
    appeared, this time in the Akora system, their origins still completely unknown,
    always appearing within the Ihatalo constellation. The ships were dealt with by
    various pilots, before they could wreak too much damage. Unfortunately no-one
    was captured and the only communications were the now familiar garbled random
    noise.   \n  \nAs these attacks rise, we must surely ask ourselves, who are these
    pilots and what are they doing? Especially as sightings of these pilots starts
    creeping towards higher security space. It appears not even concord can deal with
    them, as they have failed to intercept the pilots on every occasion it has been
    recorded they have entered high security space.   \n  \nOfficial figures from
    the jumpgate records bureau for the Ihatalo system have reported a slight drop
    in industrial and light combat ship movement since the beginning of these attacks."
