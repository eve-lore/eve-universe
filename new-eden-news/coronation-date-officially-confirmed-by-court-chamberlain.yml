- body: "Hedion - Jamyl Sarum will be coronated Empress Jamyl I in three days' time,
    Chamberlain Hemirin confirmed today. It has been known for several weeks that
    the coronation would take place imminently, but the precise date has been kept
    secret.   \n  \nAt a packed press conference this evening, Hemirin cited \"unresolved
    security issues\" as the reason for keeping the coronation date from the press
    for so long. Hemirin asserted also that although attendance at the coronation
    event itself was strictly by invitation, anyone wishing to join in the planned
    post-coronation festivities had \"more than enough time\" to travel to the Amarr
    system and that additional transport capacity had been made available to cope
    with expected demand.  \n  \nWhile Chamberlain Hemirin's message has been one
    of measured control, inside sources on Mekhios claim that negotiations covering
    protocol, attendance, and scheduling have repeatedly failed to reach consensus.
    A spokesman for the Chamberlain's office has denied any political concerns, calling
    such claims \"scurrilous falsehoods.\"  \n  \nIt seems clear that Friday will
    be a turning point in Amarr's recent history. The coronation speech will be Jamyl's
    first formal address to her new empire, and analysts agree that she is unlikely
    to waste the opportunity to make a dramatic first turn."
