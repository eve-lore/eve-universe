- body: 'Yulai - CONCORD''s Directive Enforcement Department is maintaining a cluster-wide
    Rogue Swarm Alert due to the continuing presence of large numbers of rogue drone
    infestations throughout known space.


    Rogue drones under the direction of "Swarm Overmind" type drones are repeatedly
    emerging from deadspace and establishing nests despite the best efforts of capsuleers
    outfitted with enhanced Alpha Clone capabilities and emergency supplies of military
    equipment.


    It is believed that several million rogue drones have been destroyed in the last
    7 days but DED analysts believe that many tens of millions more are being directed
    by a network of hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of the Swarm Overmind
    variant drones. It is feared that the ongoing Rogue Swarm invasion attempt may
    continue for several weeks and require continued vigilance by CONCORD, the empires
    and independent capsuleers.


    Despite the continuing major rogue drone outbreak, preparations for the Yoiul
    Festival that will mark the end of YC119 and the beginning of YC120 remain on
    track. However, given the ongoing Rogue Swarm Alert, it is understood that additional
    security measures are to be funded by order of the Inner Circle.'
