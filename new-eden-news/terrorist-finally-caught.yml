- body: Earlier today Caldari Navy did a raid in Dantumi, leading the capture of the
    terrorist named Black Scarab. Miss Yaila Heeth, aka Black Scarab, had for several
    years been working disguised as a Caldari Navy courier, using her clearance to
    gain access to information and designs to be used against the Caldari Empire in
    acts of terrorism. She has earlier been under suspicions for espionage and a tip
    from an unknown source led to her capture while setting charges that would have
    disrupted gate travel out of the solar system Dantumi until repaired. She has
    now been moved to a secret location while waiting for prosecution.
