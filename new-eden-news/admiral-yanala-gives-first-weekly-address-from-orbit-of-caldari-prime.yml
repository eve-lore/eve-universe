- body: "LUMINAIRE - Admiral Visera Yanala gave her first public address today, after
    being drafted back into command of the Leviathan class titan _Shiigeru_ which
    orbits the troubled planet of Caldari Prime.\n\nThroughout the address, she made
    numerous mentions of the  \"heroic effort of Caldari rescue teams\" as the cleanup
    from yesterday evening's Shintoko Tower collapse continues. Her release also praised
    the troops of the Provist occupation force for their \"courageousness and professionalism
    in restoring order to the cities of Arcurio and Pakuri.\" She also led those assembled
    in a minute of silence and paid tribute to those whose lives were lost during
    the course of yesterday's events.\n\nDuring the address she assured the press
    that \"those living within Gallente habitation zones on Caldari Prime have nothing
    to fear. Peace and order will be maintained, and so long as the newly enacted
    curfew is adhered to, there will be no further disturbances or use of force to
    ensure calm.\"\n\nThe address was closed with the vow that under her command,
    the Provist security force \"will continue to work toward a peaceful resolution
    of the troubles on Caldari Prime.\" She also added that \"all residents of Caldari
    Prime, both Gallente and Caldari, will be provided for and protected from harm
    until such time as full law and order is restored.\"\n\nReactions to Admiral Yanala's
    words have been varied and widespread. Paakadan Uotadan, a leading security consultant
    to the Kaalakiota Corporation, responded to the address by claiming \"Admiral
    Yanala is the perfect choice for this situation. Her service record with the Caldari
    Navy is a testament to her level-headedness and solid judgment. The fate of Caldari
    Prime is in good hands.\"\n\nMeanwhile, opinions in the Federation remain in harsh
    opposition to the Caldari Providence Directorate. Gallente Senator Rauze Coulon
    reacted with a scathing statement against the Provist occupation force from his
    family estate on the outskirts of Hueromont.  \n\nIn Yulai, the CONCORD Assembly
    remains tight-lipped with regards to ongoing events with the exception of a single
    Intergalactic Summit transmission yesterday evening in which DED Director of Operations
    Arve Vesren stated that \"CONCORD will continue to closely monitor the situation.\""
