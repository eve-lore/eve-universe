- body: '_Taisy -_ Three Provists piloting stolen Caldari Navy Chimeras escaped Taisy
    after the capsuleer alliance Pandemic Legion protected them from the fleets that
    had come to destroy them. Numerous capsuleer ships were destroyed, both by the
    carriers and Pandemic Legion forces, without any Provist losses. After roughly
    45 minutes of combat, the Provist forces thanked Pandemic Legion for their assistance,
    declared their operation complete, and then jumped out of the system to an unknown
    destination.


    The Caldari Navy has characterized the escape as a major setback. "It had seemed
    that the prior operations had proven large capsuleer alliances could work alongside
    the empires when justice is on the line," said Wing Commander Hikemi Korrado.
    "Unfortunately, this event proves that they cannot all be trusted to act in the
    best interests of interstellar prosperity. Hopefully this is an isolated incident
    and not indicative of the future."


    According to the Navy, the bounties remain on the heads of the three pilots. The
    nature of the Provist objective in Taisy is currently unknown.'
