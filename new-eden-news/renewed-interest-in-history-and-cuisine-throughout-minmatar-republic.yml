- body: 'As a new educational term draws near at Republic University, school administrators
    are reporting a record number of students enrolling in university programs based
    on Minmatar history and culture, previously low-attendance subjects within the
    University. University heads state this is a natural follow-on from the increased
    self-confidence the Republic has found itself imbued with over these past months.


    Last week, the movement of Culture Reclamation received several notable increases
    in grants from the tribes. The movement, founded by the Brutor Tribe when the
    Republic was formed, concentrates on restoring the culture and history lost to
    the Minmatar people during the long years of Amarrian occupation and enslavement.


    Also showing growth is Native Freshfood, known for taking "classic" and "lost"
    Minmatar recipes and adapting them to modern cooking techniques. Classic Minmatar
    cuisine has a significantly higher nutritional value than more common "modern"
    dishes, making it easier and cheaper to provide quality meals. Native Freshfood
    attributes the rise in sales of ingredients and recipes to both the reduced cost
    of meal preparation and the desire of Minmatar to "eat like Minmatar."'
