    - A Lai Dai Corporation ammunition factory was destroyed late last night following
    a chain reaction starting in one of the installation's warehouses. Fourteen deaths
    have been confirmed, with over 500 injured workers in intensive care due to injuries
    sustained in the event. Lai Dai officials have called the explosion \"an act of
    deliberate sabotage.\"\n\nThe event is thought to have started by the detonation
    of warheads stored in the base's warehouses, leading to the destruction of a majority
    of the stored ordinance and several of the facility's manufacturing arrays, as
    well as the warehouses themselves. Lai Dai Protection Service teams responded
    quickly and were at the location within minutes of the event.\n\nRaustilo Nesenoilen,
    representing the Internal Security division of the Lai Dai Corporation, Noted
    in response to the attack, \"The Lai Dai Corporation will not tolerate this unprovoked
    hostility, and our enemies can expect fierce resistance in the future.\""
