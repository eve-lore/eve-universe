- body: 'Pator - In a joint press conference held moments ago on the Minmatar homeworld,
    Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor and Thukker Chief Einnar Aeboul have announced that the
    Thukker Tribe is to join the Minmatar Republic, being conferred the status of
    an independent ''state within a state.'' Although the Thukker Tribe will join
    in political union with the other Minmatar Tribes through the emerging ''Tribal
    Republic'' being forged by Sanmatar Shakor, they will retain full autonomy within
    their home region of the Great Wildlands.


    A visibly moved Sanmatar Shakor had this to say of the tribes'' new political
    unity: "My fellow children of Matar, I stand before you as a man looking upon
    the dreams of his forefathers made real. The Seven Tribes of Matar are once more
    unified. The freedom of all Minmatar is another step closer to realization." Chief
    Einnar Aeboul, generally described as a taciturn man, had only a few words to
    say: "The people of the Great Caravans will never stop roaming, but Matar is ever
    our home."


    The announcement of political union between the Thukker and the Republic is a
    dramatic step building on the open-borders agreement of November YC110, which
    some commentators suggested was a prelude to further political convergence. The
    extent to which negotations on Thukker-Republic unity had advanced was unknown
    until Sanmatar Shakor called for an assembly of the Seven Tribes of Matar last
    Thursday. Final details of this new union and the changing political structure
    of the Minmatar Republic look to be the major business items on the agenda of
    the upcoming tribal assembly.'
