- body: The Amarrian Committee of Moral Purity and Elimination of Vice has condemned
    Stavros' claims that he intends to go forth as an Emperor. The Amarrian ruling
    system is an ancient and proven far more efficient at retaining order and peace
    than the decrepit and chaotic system sometimes referred to as Democracy. It considers

    him to retract his bid and apologize publicly for making the remarks he did where
    he criticised various prominent Amarrian community leaders.
