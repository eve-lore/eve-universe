- body: "Malkalen \u2013 For the first time since the end of the Gallente-Caldari
    War, a procession of Federation Navy warships entered Caldari Space, only this
    time flying a banner of peace. Met by Ishukone Watch ships at the Border Zone,
    civilian and military ships alike paused to watch the majestic Nyx-class super
    carrier and her escorts as it traveled to Malkalen. \n\n\"I\u2019ve never seen
    one in person before,\" admitted one Caldari Navy officer, who preferred to remain
    anonymous. \"That\u2019s one impressive looking ship. Not as impressive as one
    of our own Wyverns, of course. But impressive.\" \n\nThe Caldari Navy harbors
    a great deal of respect for Admiral Alexander Noir, the pilot of the Nyx and the
    last living veteran of the war. He has since become a spokesman for improving
    the relationship between the two nations, undoubtedly selected for this summit
    because of his years of advocating peace. \n\n\"We wouldn\u2019t let just anyone
    fly a capital ship into the heart of our space,\" stated Caldari Navy Fleet Admiral
    Morda Engsten. \"Admiral Noir has done more to bridge our differences with the
    Federation than anyone else. We are honored to have him, as with the entire delegation.\"
    \n\nFederation Economic Minister Wadis Chene and the members of her team left
    the carrier in a shuttle and docked at Ishukone Headquarters Station moments ago,
    where she was welcomed aboard by Otro Gariushi."
