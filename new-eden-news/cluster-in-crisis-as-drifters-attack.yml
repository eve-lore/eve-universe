    Drifters Attack Systems Across Cluster\nDrifter-controlled forces have attacked
    solar systems in all four major nations. The attacks have focused on civilian
    infrastructure, triggering the deployment of military crisis response forces.
    Initial strikes by the Drifters have already led to a death toll in the thousands,
    with that number expected to climb as the violence continues. \n\nThe motivation
    behind the Drifter aggression is unclear. The targeted systems are of little strategic
    significance, there are no signs of permanent occupation, and no resources are
    being extracted by either the Drifters or the Sleeper Drones under their control.
    The only clue to the Drifters' goals are the surveillance structures at the heart
    of their efforts. Named \u201CVigilant Dreamers\u201D, these structures appear
    to be the focal points of Drifter activity in affected systems. Defending forces
    are attempting to gather sufficient intel to pinpoint and ultimately destroy these
    Dreamers. \n\nMilitary leaders of the Amarr, Caldari, Gallente, and Minmatar alike
    have called on capsuleers to aid them in their counteroffensives against what
    is being called the Drifter Crisis. Operations are being broadcasted to Capsuleers
    from Crisis systems via their AIR Opportunities interfaces.\n\n### Gallente Districts
    Adapt With Federation Support\nThroughout the Federation, districts have been
    thrown into turmoil by Drifter strikes. Local administrations have been forced
    to reorganize using emergency procedures put in place by President Celes Aguard\u2019s
    Crisis Management team.\n\nToday\u2019s attacks have silenced many who questioned
    President Aguards decision to postpone the Federation\u2019s regularly scheduled
    elections. Only the Federalist-Liberal Party has remained vocal in their criticism,
    accusing the President of using an atmosphere of fear to disrupt the lawful democratic
    process. Her own party, the Progressive Unionists, have dismissed these claims,
    praising Aguard for putting the defense of the Federation first.\n\nThe President
    herself spoke at a press conference on Luminaire today, praising the \u201Cdedication
    and bravery\u201D of those who have taken up the fight against the Drifters. When
    questioned she was reluctant to give a definitive answer on the rescheduling of
    the election, stating that \u201Cthis crisis has only just begun\u201D. \n\n###
    Caldari State \u201CStands As One\u201D in Face of Threat\nSpeaking aboard a Chimera
    class carrier, Chairman Akimaka Saraki has commended the Caldari Navy for its
    speedy deployment to all systems in conflict. He added that \u201Cthe very best
    of the State cannot be distracted from their sworn duty.\u201D \n\nSome political
    pundits took the comment as a disparaging reference to those who criticized the
    CEP for relying on Gallente intel. Saraki issued a second statement dismissing
    this analysis as divisive and unfounded. This statement began, \u201CWe are one
    Caldari. Never is this truer than when we find ourselves tested by unprecedented
    times. As long as we stand as one, none may stand against us.\u201D\n\n### Holders
    Invest at Empress' Behest \nAcross the Amarr Empire, newly deployed joint holder
    assets have moved to meet Drifter forces. Organized in secret, these newly formed
    armadas pool the resources of local nobility to enable timely countermeasures.
    Able to respond more rapidly than Imperial forces, they are part of a strategy
    that puts responsivity first. \n\nEmpress Catiz I has been credited with this
    logistical innovation. In an Empire-wide broadcast, she commended all Amarrian
    citizens for their \u201Cfortitude in the face of darkness.\u201D She called on
    \u201Call faithful to band together against the demonic abborations that plague
    our skies. In years past, these same monstrosities breached our borders and murdered
    our holy Empress Jamyl I. They caught us by surprise, but this time we are ready
    to show them the truth of our Lord\u2019s will.\u201D\n\n### Republic Scrambles
    to Respond\nThe Republic Fleet has scrambled to defend clan holdings under attack.
    Thukker Chief Ennar Aeboul has criticized Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor and the Tribal
    council for failing to heed his tribe\u2019s warnings of a rising Drifter threat.
    \u201CWe who wander are tired of being overlooked,\u201D he told reporters, \u201CIt
    brings me great sorrow that innocent Matari must now pay such a high price for
    the Republic\u2019s foolishness.\u201D\n\nThe Sanmatar has deflected these criticisms,
    saying that \u201Cnow is the time for unity. Despite what Aeboul might think,
    the Republic Fleet is always ready to defend our people. We should be focussed
    on how to support them, not casting aspersions.\u201D\n\n### Deathless Circle
    Blamed By SOCT\nAs the nations of New Eden respond to the Drifter threat, their
    representatives are being hosted at an emergency CONCORD summit in Yulai. As diplomats
    headed into session, the Society of Conscious Thought\u2019s Elder Mentor Matshi
    Raish spoke to the press, laying the blame for the ongoing crisis at the feet
    of the Deathles Circle. \n\n\u201CThese Drifter attacks are the direct result
    of the Deathless and his Circle\u2019s reckless hubris. Their occupation of the
    Fulcrum and Warden structures has clearly awoken a threat that long lay dormant.
    Through their interference with technologies beyond their understanding they have
    unleashed tragedy upon our cluster.\u201D\n\nRumors have spread that the Deathless
    Cricle are attempting to take advantage of the current situation by deploying
    research outposts within Crisis systems, only to come under attack by the Drifters
    themselves. While calls for aid have been registered, military forces are encouraging
    capsuleers to bring any research produced at Circle facilities to national intelligence
    agencies, and not to aid the criminal organization.\n\n### New in Brief\n- New
    rifts appear across New Eden as SOCT detect new conflict zones in Abyssal Deepflows.\n\n-
    Massive destruction in Molden Heath as capsuleers go head to head.\n\n- CONCORD
    interface \u201Cmulti-open\u201D functionality wows crate enthusiasts.\n\n- Voluval
    suspended in many Minmatar clans in response to Drifter attacks.\n\n- Mountain
    Faction leads State military and civilian relief fundraising initiative.\n\n-
    Amarr-Drifter war veterans account for record number reenlistments.\n\n- Archaeologists
    confused by temporary emergences of Jovian relics in Crisis systems."
