- body: "Nakugard \u2013 Republic forces announced today the capture and arrest of
    a Nakugard resident on suspicion of taking part in the sabotage of the Krusual
    Tribe arms complex in which a confirmed 107 workers, the majority Krusual, lost
    their lives. Sources within the Republic Customs Service indicated that Kammas
    Grayli, 42 years old and apparently a Republic citizen, was captured by a customs
    frigate as he tried to avoid a search and slip through the Hek stargate in a shuttle.
    These sources also indicated that an Ammatar link has been established through
    Grayli.\n\nBackground checking on Grayli indicates that although he is nominally
    of Sebiestor lineage, he has a Nefantar grandfather. In light of this, the Customs
    Service has traced Grayli's movements in the last three years and determined that
    he has visited the Ammatar Mandate on at least one occasion. Ostensibly, Grayli
    has acted as a technical advisor in the mining industry and was present at a negotiation
    held during a short-lived ceasefire in the borderlands of the Republic and the
    Mandate. It is believed that Grayli's expertise with explosives and the possibility
    that he is an Ammatar agent has made him the prime suspect in the sabotage case.\n\nKrusual
    forces have been increasingly active in the borderlands between the Republic and
    the Ammatar Mandate. There have been numerous encounters and stand-offs between
    light patrol groups belonging to the Krusual militia and Ammatar forces. These
    have heightened tensions on the border and it has been reported that in one incident
    warning shots were exchanged. Ammatar-backed sabotage of the Nakugard arms manufacturing
    facility may be aimed at disrupting the logistics of the Krusual forces deployed
    along the disputed border.\n\nNo official announcement has been released and Republic
    authorities are continuing to gather evidence at the site of the explosions while
    urging all residents to maintain vigilance. The Krusual Tribe has not yet commented
    on the sabotage or investigation while it prepares for the funeral rituals of
    those tribal members who died in the arms complex. Several regiments of tribal
    militia and a full battlegroup of Krusual warships remain on high alert in Nakugard."
