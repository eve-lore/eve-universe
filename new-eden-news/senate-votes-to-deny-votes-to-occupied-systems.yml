    The Federation Senate passed special legislation today to deny occupied systems
    the right to vote in Federation elections. The bill, which is expected to be signed
    into law by President Souro Foiritan later in the week, passed with little opposition,
    the only dissenting votes coming from senators from Placid and Solitude.  \n  \nThe
    bill applies to any Federation territory occupied by a foreign power, which currently
    includes much of Placid, including population centers such as Intaki Prime.   \n
    \ \nPresidential candidate Senator Vilard Garioss, who voted for the bill, said,
    \"[This bill] cleared up a potentially messy legal issue [that could have] potentially
    invalidated the results of the upcoming election.\" Other candidates have yet
    to comment publicly on the issue.  \n  \nSenator Jolie Maurice of Reschard denounced
    the bill, saying, \"The people who must suffer under Caldari occupation are the
    ones who will be affected the most by the election. We should have looked for
    solutions to their inability to vote, rather than passing a law that essentially
    tells them they don't count.\""
