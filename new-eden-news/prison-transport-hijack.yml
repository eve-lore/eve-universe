- body: "EURGRANA: Leaked documents from CONCORD have revealed massive security lapses
    that led to the capture and destruction of a prison transport ship. \n\nThe documents
    detail the transfer of a prisoner from a classified facility deep within the Geminate
    region to an intelligence review board meeting in the system of Aldik via a vessel
    disguised as a Minmatar industrial ship. \n\nIt is clear from the documents that
    the prisoner was someone CONCORD had recently captured and were hoping to gain
    valuable intelligence from, purportedly regarding a terrorist cell operating within
    empire space. \n\nWhilst events on board the transport ship remain a mystery,
    not least because no crew survived, it is known that the transport made an unscheduled
    stop in Eurgrana where an unknown number of terrorists seized the vessel. \n\n\"Suddenly
    there were black robed figures carrying weapons rushing up a transport ship's
    ramp, you didn't need implants to realise the echo of weapons fire and the screaming
    meant something had gone wrong on board,\" remarked station dock worker Sal Vaslen.
    \n\nCONCORD were aware of the breech almost immediately due to station and customs
    scanners and reacted by placing a bounty on the transport and passengers as well
    as sending its own ships to the vicinity to the station. \n\nAs soon as the transport
    undocked it was destroyed by a number of ships belonging to local pilots. \n\nCONCORD
    swiftly removed several biomass items from the wreckage. \n\nThere has as yet
    been no official word from CONCORD representatives on this latest embarassing
    episode."
