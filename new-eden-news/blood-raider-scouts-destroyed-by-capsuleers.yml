- body: '**The Bleak Lands** - A Blood Raiders scouting force was destroyed late last
    night in Oyonata, after leading capsuleers on a multi-system chase through portions
    of Domain and the Bleak Lands.


    The scouting force, which consisted of two Ashimmu-class cruisers, apparently
    began their journey early in the day in Delve, which the Blood Raiders call home,
    and slowly made their way to Niarja in Domain. Upon arrival, the two began receiving
    intelligence from spies which had infiltrated inhabited planets and discussed
    the apparent viability of launching attacks upon them.


    Local capsuleers, who had been tracking the Blood Raiders since they first began
    appearing in comm channels, converged on the system and made attempts to interdict
    them. However, the Raiders managed to evade their pursuers through a combination
    of cloaking and fast warping.


    The two continued on through several systems, continuing to pause briefly in each
    to receive further planetside intelligence. Reports claim the Raiders appeared
    most excited in the Sasiekko and Myyhera systems, proclaiming the presence of
    heavy ground-fighting on inhabited planets and unusual corpses in the aftermath.


    With their capsuleer pursuers closing in on them, the Blood Raiders attempted
    to flee into low security space. They quickly made their way toward Oyonata, formerly
    the home system of the Blood Raiders prior being ejected from the Bleak Lands
    several years ago, and currently the site of continued conflict between the 24th
    Imperial Crusade and Tribal Liberation Force.


    In Oyonata, they began a survey of one final planet and rendezvoused with an Archon-class
    carrier piloted by a long-serving Blood Raider. The capsuleers who had been following
    them had not broken off their pursuit, however, and engaged the Blood Raiders.
    While initially lacking the firepower to take down the carrier, additional forces
    began to pour into the system and an ad hoc fleet of roughly 40 capsuleers eventually
    destroyed it.


    The Blood Raiders managed to escape in their pods and vowed to return to reclaim
    their former home systems. The Amarr Navy has raised their alert status in the
    Bleak Lands as a result.'
