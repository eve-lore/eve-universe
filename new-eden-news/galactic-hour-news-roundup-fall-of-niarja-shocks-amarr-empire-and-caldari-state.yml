- body: "The Scope's Galactic Hour with Ret Gloriaxx brings your roundup of the latest
    news from around the cluster, with the fall of Niarja severing the vital direct
    stargate link between the Amarr Empire and Caldari State, as continued losses
    of systems in the Caldari State stoke protests.\n\n**Fall of Niarja a \"Strategic
    Catastrophe\" for Amarr Empire and Caldari State**\n\nAmarr Prime - The conquest
    of Niarja by the Triglavian Collective has been described as a \"strategic catastrophe\"
    for the Amarr Empire and Caldari State by diplomatic sources, despite praise from
    EDENCOM and CONCORD officials for the \"valiant efforts\" of capsuleer defenders,
    EDENCOM forces and the Amarr Navy. The occupation of Niarja by the Triglavian
    Collective effectively severs the direct trade link between the Amarr Empire and
    Caldari State, though it is still possible for heavily protected and escorted
    traffic to continue using the stargates.\n\nAs a system in itself Niarja has always
    been of secondary importance to its neighbor, the heavily-populated and well-developed
    Bahromab system, but as a site suitable for a long-range stargate to the Caldari
    system of Kaaputenen, it has been a key strategic location for decades. The importance
    of Niarja to interstellar trade is underlined by the presence of a number of Gallente
    and Minmatar stations in the Yekti-Hoosa Development Zone overseen by House Sarum.
    Large mining and industrial concerns have found the Niarja-Kaaputenen link highly
    useful for shipping via the Caldari State to the Gallente Federation and even
    on to the Minmatar Republic.\n\nMilitarily and diplomatically, the route has been
    a useful high traffic and single jump route between the Amarr Empire and Caldari
    State. While military and diplomatic traffic is also able to use various jump-drive
    routes together with Empire and State cyno beacons, jump bridges and conduit gates,
    it remains a severe blow to the two allied powers. CONCORD conflict monitors have
    sounded a note of alarm that the Amarr Empire may view it as necessary to redouble
    its efforts in the Amarr-Minmatar militia warzone.\n\nA number of systems considered
    Minmatar under the Yulai Accords and Convention have become longstanding Amarr
    strongholds due to the efforts of the 24th Imperial Crusade, House Sarum and a
    sustained, high-intensity campaign by Amarr capsuleer militias. Strategic eyes
    have turned to a number of Metropolis systems as potentially providing bridging
    routes for Amarr and Caldari forces to use.\n\nWhile observers of Imperial Court
    politics believe the loss of Niarja is a blow to the prestige of House Sarum,
    this may be considerably tempered by House Sarum's sponsorship of aggressive operations
    in the Metropolis warzone. House Sarum allies among the Major and Minor Houses
    have begun praising the \"farsighted\" policies of Lord Arrach Sarum in this regard.
    Partisans of other Royal Houses have responded to this line with \"polite but
    ill-concealed scorn\" according to our Imperial Court correspondents.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/edencom_burns_niarja.png)

    allied capsuleer forces._\n\n**Battle of Niarja Scene of High-Intensity Capsuleer
    Combat on All Sides**\n\nNiarja, Domain - The Battle of Niarja represented the
    most high-intensity struggle between EDENCOM loyalists and pro-Triglavian capsuleers
    during the invasions, with preliminary estimates indicating total capsuleer presence
    in Niarja above 600 pilots during key engagements and sustaining system populations
    of over 500 capsuleers locked in combat for many hours.\n\nWith EDENCOM and Imperial
    forces stretched thinly across New Eden, the balance of power in systems invaded
    by Triglavian forces has usually been swayed by capsuleers fighting for one side
    or the other. The day-and-a-half Battle of Niarja is estimated to have involved
    the loss of over 40,000 vessels with perhaps as much as 10% of that total being
    accounted for by capsuleer losses on all sides.\n\nEDENCOM Provost Marshal Kasiha
    Valkanir has thanked EDENCOM-aligned capsuleers for their \"valiant efforts to
    secure this strategically vital system\" and has promised that \"despite this
    setback the forces of civilization shall prevail and ultimately defeat the Triglavian
    menace.\" Amarr Inner Circle delegate Captain Marshal Sirdan xer Qosh also praised
    \"loyalist capsuleers and the forces of the Imperial Navy for their unstinting
    efforts.\" Ambassadors Keitan Yun and Devan Malate, respectively of the Minmatar
    Republic and Gallente Federation, have jointly expressed their \"deep regrets
    at the loss of Niarja\" and urged the Amarr Empire to \"end all operations that
    threaten the EDENCOM alliance.\"\n\nA particularly notable element of the capsuleer
    side of the Battle of Niarja was the presence of nullsec coalitions fighting on
    both sides of the struggle. The Legacy Coalition chose to support EDENCOM efforts
    to defend the system, and preserve a secure and direct route beween the heartlands
    of the Amarr Empire and Caldari State.\n\nThe response to this decision by the
    Imperium, Legacy Coalition's opponents in a major Outer Regions war, was to support
    Collective and pro-Triglavian capsuleer efforts. Claims and counter-claims have
    flown between the nullsec powers, and established pro-EDENCOM and pro-Triglavian
    capsuleer forces, but the overall balance of power was tilted decisively to the
    invaders' favor by the combined efforts of ideological \"Kybernauts\" and the
    Imperium.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/triglavian_conduit_niarja.png)

    State Worker Protests Grow in Frequency and Number after Tunudan and Ahtila Lost**\n\nNew
    Caldari Prime - The Caldari State's loss of Tunudan system, during the Battle
    of Niarja, and the subsequent loss of the Ahtila system, have caused further uproar
    and unrest in the Caldari State. With the direct trading link to the Amarr Empire
    effectively cut, mid-tier executive classes and workers alike are expressing fears
    of the economic consequences as well as reacting to the seeming collapse of Caldari
    State military fortunes in the war itself.\n\nSeveral megacorporation spires and
    arcologies on New Caldari Prime have seen their parks and market squares inundated
    with worker protests, with corporate security forces limiting themselves to blocking
    access to upper tier zones and vital infrastructure. While the protests erupting
    on New Caldari Prime itself are a mark of the anger and confusion amongst workers
    on the capital planet, there have been uncounted incidents of protest and unrest
    across the Caldari State.\n\nProtests are particularly lively in corporate territories
    controlled by the Hyasyoda, Ishukone, Kaalakiota, Sukuuvestaa and Wiyrkomi megacorporations,
    with it being clear that their corporate security and military forces are under
    orders to act with extreme restraint. However, even territories controlled by
    CBD, Lai Dai and Nugoeihuvi are seeing protests despite the reputation for harsh
    responses from the security forces of those megacorps.\n\nThe Chief Executive
    Panel has been in emergency session for two days and it is rumored that a universal
    state of emergency will be declared amidst talk that the leadership of the Caldari
    Navy and other branches of the State Armed Forces are under house arrest. Corporate
    security force officers from all of the \"Big 8\" private militaries have reportedly
    been organized into a \"Transitional General Staff of the Corporate State of the
    Caldari People\" under the direct authority of the CEP.\n\nWhile corporate security
    forces have shown exceptional restraint in the face of worker protests, it has
    been reported there have been raids against underworld groups and clashes with
    alleged Templis Dragonaur cells, Guristas Pirate affiliates, and even gangs loyal
    to the Angel Cartel. While there has been silence from the upper echelons of the
    Caldari Navy, senior field officers have criticized the planning and execution
    of the recent refit of units seconded to EDENCOM service. Some line officers have
    also spoken of sabotage and subversion by Provists attempting to \"undermine the
    order of our Corporate State.\"\n\nExternal observers of Caldari State politics,
    particularly in the Gallente and Minmatar media, are even speculating that a long-burning
    \"corporate shadow war\" is about to break out into open conflict. Advocates of
    this theory point to a number of incidents in the last five years and more indicating
    corporate conflict and re-alignment of interests within the State.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/PKN_Jita_Project_Phase2.png)

    Warn of \"Highly Unusual Space-Time Anomalies\" in Null Security Systems**\n\nYulai,
    Genesis - Scientists have warned of \"highly Unusual and localized space-time
    anomalies\", with preliminary findings confirmed by the Exoplanets Research Division
    of CONCORD's Project Discovery. The detail of the report indicates that the star
    systems of KBP7-G, PF-346, M-OEE8, and R3-K7K are exhibiting \"signs of localized
    deformation of the space-time topology with characteristics sharing similarities
    with both unstable wormhole formation and space-time conduits as formed by Triglavian
    technology.\"\n\nObervations by a number of scientists in the Gallente Federation
    and Minmatar Republic have been the result of an ongoing research project into
    the disruption of space-time topology in the New Eden cluster, an effort sponsored
    jointly by the University of Caille and the Republic University. The University
    of Caille's Department of Astrometrics and Cosmography has been working in close
    collaboration with the Inter-Tribal Circle of Cosmology based at the Republic
    University's Illuin School of Astrophysics.\n\nA minority of scientists across
    New Eden have developed a view that the space-time \"fabric\" local to the New
    Eden \"hyper-density formation\" star cluster has been severely disrupted in recent
    years. The theory holds that this disruption has accumulated due to incidents
    such as the unstable wormhole emergence event, popularly identified with the \"Seyllin
    Catastrophe\", and the so-called \"superluminal stellar event\" at W477-P, popularly
    known as \"Caroline's Star.\" Leading theorists do accept that the superluminal
    aspects of the Caroline's Star incident is most readily explained by the formation
    of vast numbers of nanoscale wormholes through which photonic energy from the
    supernova was scattered across New Eden.\n\nWhile many mainstream scientists view
    the more radical interpretations of such recent events as \"bizarre hokum\" and
    \"not even wrong\", the leading academics of the joint project between UoC and
    RU are known to believe all avenues must be explored in explaining what is happening
    in New Eden. The Triglavian invasion, in their view, fits into the pattern as
    a third major event with the manipulation of multiple stars by the Triglavians
    \"almost certainly disrupting the local cluster's topology yet further.\"\n\n
