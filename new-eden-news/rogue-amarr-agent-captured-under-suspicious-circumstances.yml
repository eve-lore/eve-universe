- body: "In these days of high speed space warfare, if an organisation is trying to
    capture someone it is infinitely simpler to locate their clone and stake it out
    until their natural actions or hired guns make the consciousness animate the body.
    Physically capturing a pilot is unfeasible and expensive.   \n  \nIt is this very
    reason which has surrounded the operation to capture a rogue Amarr Imperial agent
    with mystery. Two days ago (Sunday), an Amarr Patrol frigate was seen scouting
    r3-k7k for pilot installations.   \n  \nLord Sorn, a representative for the ministry
    of war, recruited pilots from the surrounding systems to capture this pilots ship
    intact, a goal they achieved with the minimum of fuss.   \n  \nThe pilot, who
    was curiously operating his ship on silent running and not communicating on any
    channels was told to dock in the Zoar and Sons station in Misaba. It was escorted
    all of the way there.   \n  \nTragedy almost struck when the ship was on the verge
    of docking, when a pirate named Viceroy, opened fire on the captured vessel, destroying
    it, but his ship was destroyed by the escort fleet before he could eliminate the
    pod. The captured pilot docked safely but no word on his fate since the mission
    has been released.   \n  \nRecords show that the pilot who was captured, Jorvel
    Nekarr, has up until this incident been a fine upstanding member of the imperial
    navy. His promotion prospects were above average and he has successfully completed
    several high profile missions during the last 50 years of his career. This move
    by him has been remarked as extremely out of character by those who knew him well.
    \  \n  \nAll attempts to enquire about the incident with navy officials have been
    refused."
