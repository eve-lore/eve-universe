    head of the Theology Council, has been confirmed as one of the roughly six thousand
    casualties of the Pashanai explosion. Habi Ghamri, Commander of Security at the
    Amarrian Ministry of Internal Order, has furthermore gone on record to state the
    explosion was not, as previously believed, caused by an accidental gas leak, but
    rather represented an orchestrated act of terrorism.\n\n\"This was no accident.
    It is an empire-wide criminal investigation at this point and will continue as
    such until we have apprehended those responsible,\" he said. \"A clearer picture
    is emerging of the details on the site. We're confident we'll have some solid
    leads in the very near future.\"\n\nWhen asked if the Empire believed the attack
    to have been politically motivated, Ghamri said, \"At this stage the most we can
    do is speculate, but we aren't ruling out the possibility.\""
