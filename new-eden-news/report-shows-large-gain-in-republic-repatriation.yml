- body: 'Pator - The Republic Government today released the latest report on immigration
    figures which continued to show a dramatic decline in emigration from the Republic,
    coupled with a steady rise in Minmatar returning to the Republic from the Federation.


    Although experts in the field predicted a continuing drop in emigration numbers
    due to the positive industrial news, continuing unity from the government and
    the growing optimism of the general populace saw a surprising gain in immigration
    from the Federation.


    "A closer study of the numbers," stated Professor Kell Baraim, dean of Economics
    at the Republic University, "shows that the vast majority of those returning are
    first generation immigrants, the ones who have been in the Federation shortest.
    It remains to be seen whether this is a sustainable trend or simply a short term
    reaction to the current upswing of confidence in the Republic and its environs."'
