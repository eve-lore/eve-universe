- body: "After many meager months it seems that pirate activity is on the rise again.
    News agencies are being flooded with reports that pirates, emboldened by recent
    overhaul in their command structure and new ships, are now operating close to
    stargates, harassing unsuspecting spacefarers.   \n  \nDED recently warned about
    this possibility, citing that the confidence of all the major pirate groups are
    soaring, which naturally results in bolder attacks by them. DED will monitor the
    situation closely over the next few days to see how the pilot community responds
    to these developments, hoping that the increased pirate activity will not disrupt
    trade and mining operations overly much.   \n  \nMeanwhile, accusations are flying
    as to whom to blame for the sudden surge in pirate activity. Some are blaming
    the Jovians, others Caldari armament manufacturers and still others claim that
    DED itself is responsible, in order to increase their annual budget through illusionary
    importance. For all those pilots suffering at the hands of pirates in the outer
    regions, the truth is perhaps irrelevant."
