    Ceasefire Between Militias of the Caldari and Minmatar Followed by Amarr and Gallente
    Militia Truce\n\nYulai, Genesis \u2013 CONCORD officials have confirmed notice
    of two separate ceasefires between the Caldari and Minmatar militias, and Amarr
    and Gallente militias respectively, both taking effect at 11:00 NEST, today. Under
    the CONCORD Emergency Militia War Powers Act of YC110 (CEMWPA), any two of the
    belligerent powers may may declare and register miltia ceasefires at any time,
    suspending the state of mutual warfare between their capsuleer militias.\n\nDiplomatic
    developments between the Caldari State and Minmatar Republic had led the high
    commands of the two empires to order the ceasefire for today, having given notice
    of their intentions to the Amarr Empire and Gallente Federation. The Empire and
    Federation rapidly followed suit by issuing their own orders for a ceasefire between
    their own militia fighters.\n\nThe Amarr Empire and Minmatar Republic remain in
    a state of limited war within the terms of the CEMWPA legislation across the Amarr-Minmatar
    warzone. Similarly, the Caldari State and Gallente Federation continue to wage
    a border conflict using capsuleer militias according to the provisions of the
    CEMWPA protocol. CONCORD conflict monitors remain concerned at the continuing
    escalation in the two warzones, involving continuing and multiple breaches of
    the Emergency Militia War Powers Act carried out by national militaries, mercenary
    groups, and paramilitaries.\n\n![Shakor Addresses Crowd](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/7CL6U8afQF0BNwA70L8N5h/faac4634ad4c58663132ddd6ee681391/Shakor_Great_Caravanserai.png)

    of Non-Aggression Signed in Twin Ceremonies on New Caldari Prime and Matar\n\nNew
    Caldari Prime and Matar \u2013 A new treaty of non-aggression between the Caldari
    State and Minmatar Republic has been signed by Chairman Akimaka Saraki and Sanmatar
    Maleatu Shakor in twin ceremonies on New Caldari Prime and Matar. Informally being
    called the \"Treaty of Airaken\" after the Caldari system where it was negotiated,
    the new treaty provides limited but definite guarantees of \"peaceful co-existence
    and mutual respect for territorial borders\" between the State and Republic.\n\nChairman
    Akimaka Saraki of the Caldari Chief Executive Panel signed the treaty along with
    CEOs of the \"Big 8\" megacorporations of the Caldari State, before presenting
    the State-authorized copy of the treaty to Republic Prime Minister Tobias Efrit.
    The Caldari signing ceremony was held in the exclusive setting of the Chief Executive
    Panel boardroom located at the pinnacle of the CEP Spire in Landfall City, New
    Caldari Prime.\n\nFor the Minmatar Republic, Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor signed before
    the Chiefs of the Seven Tribes of Matar made their marks, with the Republic-authorized
    copy of the treaty then being presented to Hyasyoda CEO Ahtonen Osmon, the latter
    acting as personal representative of the CEP in negotiations. The Minmatar signing
    ceremony was held in the chamber of the Tribal Council in the Great Caravansarai
    on Matar.\n\nChairman Saraki hailed the Treaty of Airaken as a \"long overdue
    step in establishing a lasting and prosperous peace between the peoples of the
    Caldari State and the Minmatar Republic.\" Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor declare the
    treaty to be \"quite natural as a consequence of the nature and actions of our
    two great independent and proud nations.\" The non-aggression treaty has been
    broadly welcomed by the public of both the Republic and the State, with corporations,
    families, and clans all looking forward to opportunities for future trade and
    exchange with more normalized relations between the two empires.\n\n![concord

    Efforts for Capsuleer Militias Opening Direct Enlistment for Pilots\n\nYulai,
    Genesis \u2013 Despite the news of ceasefires, the CONCORD Assembly has formally
    enacted a long-expected and scheduled amendment to the CONCORD Emergency Militia
    War Powers Act of YC110 (CEMWPA) permitting the \"direct enlistment\" of independent
    capsuleer pilots with a militia of one of the \"Big 4\" CONCORD powers even if
    their parent corporation is not affiliated with that militia.\n\nWith the escalation
    of warfare in the Amarr-Minmatar and Caldari-Gallente theaters, all four of the
    core empires have been increasing their recruitment efforts and the change to
    the CEMWPA legislation has been one of the few items of CONCORD business on which
    all have agreed in recent years. The direct enlistment provisions will permit
    a pilot not in a capsuleer corporation already affiliated with a militia, or a
    CONCORD member-flagged corporation, to sign up with the militia of their choice
    independently.\n\nMilitary planners among the high commands of the \"Big 4\" are
    evidently hoping to attract an influx of new capsuleer fighters to their militias,
    a need potentially made all the more urgent by the shifts in diplomacy that have
    seen the Amarr-Caldari and Gallente-Minmatar military alliances dissolve. Observers
    of capsuleer paramilitaries, mercenaries, and outer regions fighters have mixed
    views on the prospects for advantage to flow to any given empire with this move,
    with many suggesting it is a considerable gamble with great potential for disruption
    in both warzones.\n\n![imp nvy base mehatoor](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/34kz4ZxXM9gVLQtW6BgbcI/30744869f4d530162ee042ecdba83f96/imp_nvy_base_mehatoor.png)

    Authories Order Truce in Response to Caldari-Minmatar Treaty and Ceasefire\n\nPashanai,
    Genesis \u2013 Amarr and Gallente military authorities have taken rapid steps
    to order a ceasefire between their respective capsuleer militias, the 24th Imperial
    Crusade and the Federal Defense Union. Amarr and Gallente negotiators continue
    to work on a formal agreement in a diplomatic conference in the Pashanai system
    but the signing of the Caldari-Minmatar \"Treaty of Airaken\", and the formal
    ceasefire ordered for 11:00 NEST today, has led the Amarr Ministry of War and
    the Federal Security Council to issue an urgent ceasefire order to match the effective
    cessation of hostilities between the Caldari and Minmatar militias.\n\nNegotiations
    between the Amarr Empire's Royal Heir Ersilia Kor-Azor and the Gallente Federation's
    Councillor Wayaki Kayara are understood to be at an advanced stage, with the outlines
    of a \"non-intervention treaty\" said to be settled. Outstanding matters are reported
    to include the matter of continuing economic sanctions levied by the Gallente
    Federation on certain Amarr organizations and officials, together with the status
    of Federation citizens held as prisoners or slaves in various parts of the \"Greater
    Amarr Empire\". The Amarr Empire appears to be concerned to establish better trade
    relations with the Federation but is continuing to avoid concessions on the vexed
    question of Triglavian technology.\n\n![intaki fort vey gt](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/4nT5AtrEWnPXAKzevu8lTf/056bd3fc1c737f418c08ee9c5c425d18/intaki_fort_vey_gt.png)
    *Above: Federation fortifications at Vey stargate in Intaki system*\n\n### Federation
    Increases Security Status of Intaki Despite Continuing Violence on Intaki Prime\n\nIntaki
    Prime, Placid \u2013 Federation authorities have increased the security status
    to Intaki system to 0.6 and lifted a moratorium on the anchoring of capsuleer
    structures, despite continuing violence and civil unrest on the planet of Intaki
    Prime. CONCORD has received notice of the status change and the re-authorization
    of capsuleer structure rights under the Yulai Convention, but has expressed \"concern\"
    at the level of violence in population centers on Intaki Prime.\n\nCivil disturbances
    and sporadic street-fighting in Lenoika, largest city and cultural capital of
    Intaki Prime, have entered their second week, while isolated incidents of violence
    have erupted in Navyii Akat, the administrative capital and seat of the Intaki
    Assembly. A joint call for calm from the visiting Federal Senate delegation and
    the Executive Council of the Intaki Assembly appears to have fallen on deaf ears
    as a number of riots have taken place, with shootings and bombings adding to a
    lethal swirl of violence on the Intaki home world. \n\nChief Councillor Vera en
    Sullacio of the Intaki Assembly's executive has mobilized the Intaki Militia to
    support the city constabularies and planetary gendarmes in keeping peace. Federal
    Marines have been withdrawn to Kainta Yavaat spaceport, Federal compounds, and
    naval installations across the planet, following an urgent request to President
    Celes Aguard by Senators Kelen Ontbad and Shaileen Ramnev, leading the Senate
    delegation's inspection tour. Jonas Ivestara, leader of the Intaki Autonomists
    movement, is also reported to have begun talks with the main faction of the Free
    Intaki Army in an effort to halt attacks on Federation personnel and property.\n\n![imperial
