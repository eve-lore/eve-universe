- body: "YULAI. Frustrated by the lack of support from university administration officials;
    professors, researchers, and students have come together to create the Utopian
    Scholar Foundation \u2013 a multicultural academic institution free from the influence
    of the Empires. \n\nThe foundation, headed up by Dr. Rolleniae of the University
    of Caille, seeks to represent students and professors as well as other scholars
    from across New Eden. It aims to be the voice of those who wish to promote academic
    interests, regardless of race, religion, or political affiliation. \n\nAlthough
    no public announcement has been made by the foundation regarding how the organisation
    will operate, the USFTN has still managed to appear at several major centers of
    learning scattered across the four empires, where affected members of the academic
    community have flocked to join the growing organisation. \n\nScholars within the
    community have been motivated to join the foundation following the student protests
    that have appeared on several university campuses across New Eden. Tensions between
    students and administrative staff have been steadily increasing in the past several
    weeks due to many universities resisting inter-empire academic development, an
    issue the USFTN was founded upon. For the most part, these protests have remained
    peaceful. But, as [reported earlier](http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=1283),
    they have recently turned violent, prompting authorities to increase police presence
    at the site of each protest. \n\nThe sudden turn to violence at these protests
    is perhaps one of the reasons that prompted the USFTN's creation. The Utopian
    Scholar Foundation hopes to organize protestors among academic community into
    a cohesive voice, one whose call for less political involvement in academic interests
    will be heard by policymakers in the four empires. \n\nWhile more specific details
    regarding how the USFTN will operate still remain unclear, the foundation appears
    to be well-funded and well-run. With its recent purchase of office space in the
    CONCORD station in the Yulai system, the foundation will likely become an important
    player in inter-empire relations over the coming months."
