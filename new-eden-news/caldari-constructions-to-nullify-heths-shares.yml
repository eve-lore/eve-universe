    has announced it will convene a shareholder''s vote to nullify his shares in the
    company. It anticipates this vote will be finalized within a month.


    Under Caldari Constructions corporate law, an individual who is unable to exercise
    their duties as a shareholder and has no designated heir or representative to
    assume control of those shares may have their share ownership nullified by vote.
    This provision of corporate law is rarely invoked and, when done, is typically
    voted down. Due to the unusual circumstances surrounding this vote, it is expected
    to comfortably pass.


    The nullification of the shares will allow the corporation to move forward on
    several important decisions, including replacing Heth as CEO. This vote is expected
    to occur in economic quarter 4.'
