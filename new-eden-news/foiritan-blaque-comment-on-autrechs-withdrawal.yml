    Mentas Blaque today sent out press releases detailing the two candidates\u2019
    stances on Eman Autrech\u2019s surprise withdrawal of his presidential bid yesterday
    morning.   \n  \nThe President\u2019s Office\u2019s statement reads: \u201CIt
    comes as a blow to this democracy and a personal shock to the President that a
    good man such as Autrech should decide to step down. His reasons for doing so
    are doubtless solid and just. The Foiritan Administration wishes the candidate
    the best of luck in whatever tasks he chooses to undertake next.\u201D   \n  \nSenator
    Blaque\u2019s statement, meanwhile, describes Autrech as \u201Creneging on his
    duties to this country and this democracy\u201D and \u201Cbowing under the pressure
    of competition.\u201D It furthermore states that the candidate\u2019s withdrawal,
    while \u201Ca tragedy for the man himself and his supporters\u201D is \u201Cnonetheless
    a blessing for those of us who are serious about our participation in this race,
    as well as for everyone who is serious about seeing our nation scale the height
    of its potential.\u201D   \n  \nAutrech\u2019s withdrawal, announced yesterday
    morning, follows nearly a year\u2019s period of census-taking and district-rebordering
    by the Federation government. The period, known due to its pervasiveness of propaganda
    as \u201CThe Winter of Slogans,\u201D has seen a quietly escalating battle of
    imagery and ideology rage between the three candidates, a battle which now sees
    its first casualty. Already this afternoon, on streets bordering Mercury Square
    in Caille, workers were seen pasting a new line of Blaque posters over the frayed
    remnants of Autrech images dating back to January of this year.   \n  \nQuestioned
    about the other candidates\u2019 reactions to his withdrawal, Mr. Autrech declined
    to comment."
