    - A State appeals court yesterday backed the Provist's power to indefinitely detain
    a citizen captured on State soil without any criminal charges being laid. The
    ruling came at the hearing of 6 men arrested last week, who officials said were
    involved in a plot to lure Caldari citizens into space where they were to be offered
    to Sansha's Nation.  \n  \nA host of civil liberties groups weighed in on the
    accused men's behalf, calling on the State to supply evidence and charges. The
    presiding judge disagreed, though, stating that such authority is vital during
    this time to protect the State from Sansha incursions. The men, four Gallente
    and two Caldari, will continue to be held without charges.  \n  \nRikko Sattonnen,
    chief counsel for the Caldari Legal Foundation, said the ruling \"gave the Provists
    the needed flexibility in dealing with war criminals. You can't treat them as
    though they are just another criminal defendant.\" Adivaan Kouver, senior associate
    at Citizen's Rights First, said the ruling \"could lead to the Provists being
    allowed to hold anyone who, for example, accessed what they consider the wrong
    kind of reading from a database.\"  \n  \nLaak Katomi, a Provist Spokesman, gave
    no evidence and few details, saying only: \"All of the State's security agencies
    are actively working to protect the Caldari people from the Sansha threat.\""
