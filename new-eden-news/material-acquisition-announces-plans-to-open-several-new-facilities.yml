- body: 'ELORE - Material Acquisition has revealed that its administration of Gallente-districts
    on Caldari Prime have proven highly profitable, enabling it to open several new
    facilities throughout the Crux constellation. These facilities are expected to
    bring millions of jobs to the Gallente economy.


    According to the report, the majority of the profit has come from tariffs levied
    on inter-district trade and travel, with lesser amounts coming from administrative
    fees and rebuilding contracts. The corporation expects contract profit will drop
    off as the planet is brought back to full repair, but claims it expects tariffs
    will rise as further settlers recolonize the planet.'
