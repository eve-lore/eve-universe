    Today's lively Senate session was given over entirely to the internal process
    of naming and winnowing down candidates for the vacant Head of Senate position.
    Early debate has identified three potential front-runners for the position.\n\nVance
    Opheron, who currently serves as chairman of the Senate Defense Committee, was
    quickly nominated and seconded by a large contingent of senators who feel his
    experience on military matters would serve the nation well. In light of the ongoing
    armed conflict with the Caldari State, this sentiment appears popular. Remnants
    of the earlier Naval Review scandal surround Opheron, but his position in that
    matter has since been largely vindicated.\n\nAlso nominated was Aulmont Meis,
    head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A career diplomat, Meis is seen
    as a moderate voice within the government. Though some charge that she was too
    closely associated with former President Souro Foiritan's policies, Meis herself
    categorically denies this claim. Her voting record shows several key issues in
    which she did not back Foiritan initiatives, but her harshest critics remain dubious
    of her legislative independence.\n\nRounding out the leading candidates is Suvio
    Bellaron. Viewed as something of an \"elder statesman,\" the conservative Bellaron
    was one of Mentas Blaque's most stern critics during Blaque's tenure as the Head
    of Senate. Bellaron was a co-sponsor of the unsuccessful bill that would have
    forced Blaque to resign one of his two positions.\n\nSeveral other candidates
    have been nominated and seconded, but as yet none of them have the backing enjoyed
    by the three front-runners. The final vote for Head of Senate will take place
    in three days."
