- body: "Dumkirinur - The immigration facilities in Rens serve only as a filter to
    assist former slaves toward integration with Minmatar society. Unless complications
    arise, such as medical issues or an extreme unwillingness to incorporate, the
    new arrivals are moved within the first week to housing programs, where they receive
    further support and work placements or education.  \n  \n\"The numbers of trained
    and educated refugees we've been seeing are surprisingly high,\" reports Tjaard
    Mtaki, one of the career advisors employed by the integration facilities. \"All
    of those immigrants who served on stations and ships have a high level of education
    in fields such as mathematics and physics. We've seen expert mechanics and engineers
    who can't read or write a word, but they can accurately explain the finer points
    of essential systems maintenance. We're finding the gaps in their education and
    helping to fill them.\"  \n  \nFor younger refugees like Onyeka Djekatro, the
    changes can be intimidating. She has been offered a place at the Republic Military
    School, helping to maintain the station's vast essential systems. \"It's so different.
    I have no one to tell me what I should be doing. I go to classes every day. They
    tell us what we can expect from living here, but sometimes it doesn't seem real.\"
    \ \n  \nOnyeka is far from being the only former slave who has reported difficulty
    in adapting to their new liberty. Many freed slaves have admitted to feelings
    of apprehension when venturing beyond the confines of their quarters, and groups
    residing in the same housing clusters have begun to band together in small pseudo-family
    units. \"We look out for our own,\" said one woman, who refused to be named."
