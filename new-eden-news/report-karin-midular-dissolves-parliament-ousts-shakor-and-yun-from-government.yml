- body: "Illuin - The political crisis in the Minmatar Republic worsened as Prime
    Minister Karin Midular defiantly responded to Shakor's successful vote of no-confidence
    by dissolving parliament. The measure requires a call for new elections within
    two months, as mandated by Republic law. In addition, there are reports that Ambassador
    Keitan Yun has been relieved of his post and that Parliament Head Maleatu Shakor
    has been \"expelled\" from government. However, Karin Midular lacks the legal
    authority to dismiss an elected official unless evidence of a crime has been presented,
    which she has not yet claimed-at least not publically. \n\nMr. Yun has not been
    seen since the Yulai \"incident\", in which his apparent threat to CONCORD was
    supported by the sudden appearance of a menacing Minmatar-Thukker fleet in Yulai.
    Maleatu Shakor was last seen being escorted from session following the no-confidence
    vote against Midular. \n\nViolence erupted on the parliament floor immediately
    after her announcement, forcing station security to quickly surround and then
    escort the prime minister from session."
