- body: "MALKALEN - Logs from the Local subspace channel in the Malkalen System obtained
    by the media have confirmed that the Nyx supercarrier piloted by Admiral Alexander
    Noir of the Federation Navy was deliberately piloted into Ishukone Headquarters
    station. This attack occurred during an Economic Summit hosted by Ishukone CEO
    Otro Gariushi and included representatives from the Federation government. Partial
    transcripts of the local reveal Admiral Noir's final words, just before impact:
    \n\n\"I have an obligation to my beloved Federation to settle accounts with this
    hateful race, these cursed Caldarians. For my entire life, I have mourned for
    Hueromont, wishing, praying, willing for the day when I could strike back on behalf
    of those souls who perished. Fate has bestowed upon me this grand opportunity,
    this great day, to take vengeance for all those who gave their lives for the Federation,
    the true guardian of our precious Gallentean race . . . may you rest in peace
    now, brave souls of Hueromont, and you, kindred spirits of Nouvelle Rouvenor,
    knowing that I will take back what was stolen from you . . . Curse you, Caldari
    . . . may I take as many of you with me that I can!\" \n\nThe Federation has not
    issued a statement as of this time. Search and rescue efforts are underway to
    reach survivors onboard, where numerous fires are still burning throughout. The
    scale of damage to the station is catastrophic, with the death count estimated
    to reach into the hundreds of thousands."
