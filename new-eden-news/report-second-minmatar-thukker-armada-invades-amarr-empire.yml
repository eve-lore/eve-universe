- body: "Kor-Azor Prime \u2013 Heavy fighting is underway in numerous locations throughout
    the Kor-Azor Region as a second titan-backed Minmatar-Thukker armada invaded the
    Amarr Empire. Multiple surface landings have been reported on planet Eclipticum,
    and Kor-Azor Family Bureau Headquarters Station has been stormed by elite mechanized
    troops. Kor-Azor\u2019s independent security forces are defending against the
    onslaught on both land and in space, but the Minmatar-Thukker forces are overwhelming
    them with sheer numbers. \n\nAlthough the attack marks the first time in history
    that a foreign power has invaded sovereign Amarr territory, Imperial Navy warships
    have not yet moved to intercept them. \n\n_Posted 13:36 GMT_"
