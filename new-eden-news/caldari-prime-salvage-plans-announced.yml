- body: 'LUMINAIRE - A press pack released this afternoon by Material Acquisition
    outlines plans for the initial stages of a clean-up and salvage operation to remove
    the wreckage of the Leviathan-class titan CN Shiigeru, which was partially destroyed
    in orbit and impacted the planet''s surface on March 22 last year.


    The lengthy document, which gives a detailed report on the environmental impact
    of the event and covers the current conditions in the 1.2 million square kilometre
    debris field, contains proposals approved by Material Acquisition, Ishukone and
    the Gallente Senate. They would see much of the wreckage salvaged and recycled
    before being put to use in the reconstruction of Qaiian Tower, the regional headquarters
    of the Nugoeihuvi Corporation, which was heavily damaged during the vessel''s
    atmospheric entry.


    In a follow up announcement, a Material Acquisition spokeswoman confirmed that
    "although the area lies within a district under Federal administration, we will
    be working hand in hand with the Ishukone Corporation due to both the sensitive
    nature of the operation, and the extremely important historical and cultural relevance
    of the Kaalakiota mountains to the Caldari people. We intend to ensure that operations
    in both the affected area, and the city of Arcurio, are conducted with the highest
    level of respect."


    A little over an hour after the announcement, several media outlets reported sightings
    of a number of Ishukone Corporation salvage platforms being towed into low orbit
    of Caldari Prime.'
