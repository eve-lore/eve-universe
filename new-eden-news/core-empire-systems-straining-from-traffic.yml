- body: "A number of Empire solar systems are straining from the massive traffic running
    through them in recent months, and severe measures need to be taken to rectify
    the situation. Local authorities are negotiating with mega-corporations who base
    their business operations in Rens, Oursulaert and Jita to move some of their assets
    to nearby solar systems so the load on the core areas may be diverted.   \n  \nPilots
    and corporations based in the Rens, Oursulaert and Jita systems are encouraged
    to relocate their businesses, and start using their connections with agents in
    nearby systems. Mega-corporation officials point out that pilots can remain in
    business with them and advise capsuleers to utilize their agents in lower security
    systems, where the agent missions and contracts are more lucrative.   \n  \nA
    Rens pilot, when asked about the situation, stated that \"The go*bleeeep* da*bleep*
    station manager bast*bleep* had me waiting for 7 minutes before allowing me to
    undock. I'm going to the nearest 0.6, where you get complimentary bathrobes from
    agents. Fu*bleep* this *bleeeeep* *bleep*.\"   \n  \nAn Oursulaert native went
    on record, saying \"They better fix the *bleep* *bleep* *bleep* jump *bleep* gates
    before I *bleep**bleep**bleep* and then some.\" He then shouted something incomprehensible
    at nearby Customs Officials, subtle foam beginning to assemble at the corners
    of his mouth as he finally became able to jump to the next system.   \n  \nSimilar
    stories have been reported in systems like Nonni, Sobaseki, Inoue and Isaziwa.
    Wasona Binge reported that rush hour traffic was approaching \"Clusterfu*bleeep*
    proportions.\""
