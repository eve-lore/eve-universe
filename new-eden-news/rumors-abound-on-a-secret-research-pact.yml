- body: Unidentified sources within the Gallente Federation have indicated that negotiations
    for a major research pact between the Federation and the Caldari State are underway.
    Nothing has been confirmed, but it is understood that delegates from both sides
    have been meeting in a secret location, surrounded by heavy police presence to
    keep curious travelers at bay. If true, this will be a momentous event in our
    collective history and perhaps the clearest indicator yet of how much the Gallente-Caldari
    relations have thawed in recent years. A sign of future peace and prosperity if
    there ever was one. More information will be broadcast as soon as it becomes available.
