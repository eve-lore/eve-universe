    and news outlets associated with the four major nations of New Eden have been
    denied any direct access to the Deathless Circle. We understand the current Drifter
    attack is of great concern to some of our readers and as always we endeavor to
    bring you the best possible coverage of events throughout the cluster. As such,
    when we received a lead suggesting that the Siege may end soon we felt compelled
    to report on it.\n\nThe Scope has recently received a communication from an independent
    \u201Cjournalist\u201D based inside Zarzakh who purports to have access to key
    members of the Deathless Circle. An investigation into this individual has revealed
    a spotty personal history, but no evidence of any past fraud or misrepresentation
    of facts. Therefore, we have decided to publish their communication here for your
    consideration.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Scope cannot verify the veracity of this individual\u2019s
    account of events and their opinions do not represent the opinions of the Scope.
    We trust that our readers have the capacity to decide for themselves what is an
    appropriate degree of skepticism to apply to the following narrative.\n\n![fulcrum

    Report Received from Hana Shikari\nIn the name of full disclosure, and in line
    with the time-honored principles of journalistic integrity, I must begin with
    a confession that threatens to undermine the validity of the words which will
    come hereafter. I had been drinking. \n\nI was sat on the gangway of a Prowler
    wincing my way through moonshine with a cabal of neredowells keen to share tales
    of violence with any ear willing to receive it. I was in the midst of processing
    a particularly brutal tale when a more immediate incident caught our attention.
    Nearby, a Guristas pirate and dishonorable associate of the Angel Cartel had begun
    extracting the hemoglobin from one another by means of their fists. The associates
    of both parties rushed in and what had begun as an ill-tempered duel quickly escalated
    into a swarm of activity not dissimilar to a bee hive on fire.\n\nLife within
    the belly of the great leviathan known as the Fulcrum is never peaceful. It is
    a vast landscape of empty expanses that haunts the mind, leaving behind both deathly
    silence and the in-dismissible itch of being watched. In the face of such existential
    terror, the people who live here have responded by filling their living spaces
    with neon distractions and their bodies with illicit consumables.\n\nBut now the
    sharks are biting at the gates. Those who prefer action must instead sit with
    their feelings. As fear circles in, there is little to do but brood and imbibe.
    Free of diversions blood was inevitable.\n\nThe specific denizens that had been
    assisting in giving my grey matter an acid bath prior to this distraction were
    the Hrada-Oki. They are members of a starborn civilization with a lower population
    than some moons. They came to be cutting their way through the Great Wildlands
    one ship at a time. I\u2019ve passed through those reaches myself in the company
    of some freshly minted smugglers keen to make a name but less keen on star chart
    navigation. If it was not for fifteen million of someone else\u2019s ISK and a
    comedy routine I stole from a Vherikor mystic with a drinking problem, I would
    have joined those young pups on the wrong side of an airlock. Yet the Wildlanders
    who so definitively dealt with us would have shut the curtains and crawled under
    their beds at the mere mention of Hrada-Oki.\n\nMalaya Hrada, the master of their
    cutthroat caravan and a member of the Deathless' inner circle, happened to be
    in the process of thrashing me for a two-comma sum in a game of dice on that very
    gangway. As the ruckas expanded so did her displeasure. She signaled to her clansmen
    and together they descended into the bloody pit that was the rioting pirates.\n\nAs
    she moved amongst them Malaya\u2019s stormy countenance fell on the rabble like
    icy rain, and when she spoke they listened;\n\n\u201CWe are hunters, not animals.
    Animals thrash against their bars, hunters wait for the perfect moment. You shame
    both your organizations with your petty rage.\n\n\u201COut there, our enemy\u2019s
    resolve wanes, their forces deplete. Our allies have seen to that. I can tell
    you with confidence that we have but days until they are gone from our gates.\u201D\n\nI
    suspect Malaya\u2019s reputation did as much to still the crowd as her words,
    but either way, the tension was sucked out of the air and replaced with awkward
    embarrassment as the Hrada made their way back onto the ship. I decided to follow
    along with them partially out of a desire to win my kredits back and partly because
    I have always been fascinated by why the wind blows in the direction it does.\n\nAllow
    me to assure you that I am a creature of infinite sins, but sneakery is not counted
    amongst them. I had no intention of eavesdropping but I suspect that the explosion
    of chaos had blinded the Hrada to the presence of this inconsequential storyteller.
    None the less the conversation I overheard between Malaya and one of her Captains,
    Jovan Hrada, has been transcribed here to the best of my recollection:\n\n\u201CIf
    the Siege is about to break, does that mean he\u2019s found the thing?\u201D Jovan
    is not an articulate man, but he has successfully managed to retain all his limbs
    and eyes despite his profession and I believe that is to be commended.\n\n\u201CIt
    means the capsuleers have broken it for us,\u201D Malaya responded, \u201Cand
    once the Drifters cannot deploy their engines anymore the interference on whatever
    impossible sensors this insane place uses should be cleared.\u201D\n\n\u201CThen
    we get a fancy weapon to finish the job?\u201D\n\n\u201CWar isn't about weapons.
    It's about understanding and opportunities. That\u2019s what he\u2019ll bring
    to us\u201D\n\nI turned about and left the crowd at that, determined to find something
    of less significance to engage with. This cryptic exchange passed over my head
    like a Titan in orbit. My life\u2019s path has revealed a series of truths I can
    best describe as a cascading miasma of confusion, but it occurred to me that those
    whose journeys had been obfuscated by facts may find some value in it that I do
    not.  Should I happen to stumble across any other matters of similar interest
    I hope to survive long enough to share my bewilderment around those too."
