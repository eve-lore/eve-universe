- body: "With the advent of salvage technology, pod pilots have been granted the capability
    to remove useable or repairable components from ships damaged and destroyed in
    combat. These vital subsystems have given rise to an entirely new economy, namely
    the construction and sale of ship rigs. Used to improve various ship features,
    and capable of giving pilots a significant edge in combat, rigs often sell for
    millions of ISK. This relatively young economy is a profitable area for competent
    salvagers and reselling traders alike. Countless pod pilots have become professional
    salvagers, either as a part time job or in some cases, as an almost full-time
    occupation that can bring in a solid income. \n\nThen there are the \u201Cscavengers
    of the scavengers,\u201D those who search out and salvage the wrecks of ships
    other pilots have destroyed. These people typically use the superior scanning
    systems of Covert Ops vessels as they move from system to system and scan down
    the lucrative remains of recent battlefields. The majority of these wrecks come
    from capsuleers engaged in work for the various corporations that offer it. Most
    commonly, it is during the time they have returned to their agent when the \u201Cwreck
    thieves\u201D capitalize, leaving only empty space for their victims to return
    to in their specially-fitted salvage vessels. \n\nA vocal section of the capsuleer
    community has repeatedly petitioned CONCORD to have these \u201Cpirate salvagers\u201D
    dealt with. Their most frequent argument is that under current legislation wrecks
    are not legally recognized as their property, the result of which is that \u201Cwreck
    thieves\u201D are free to salvage what they like with impunity. Opinion on the
    matter is as diverse as the capsuleers class itself, with some considering everything
    \u201Cfair game\u201D and others decrying it as an outrageous oversight on CONCORD\u2019s
    behalf. \n\nWhen Marauder-class Battleships recently hit the SCC markets, many
    companies advertised them in part as \u201Cthe solution to wreck thievery\u201D.
    They pointed to the vessel\u2019s capability to salvage and fight at the same
    time by using both optimized tractor subsystems and hardpoint layouts. This has
    certainly helped some pilots, who now have little need to make return trips to
    battlefields to salvage wrecks. Despite the entry of these ships however, there
    are indications that rogue salvagers are still in heavy operation across the cluster,
    with some even claiming these ships have \u201Conly made the job easier.\u201D
    \n\nWith no official stance from CONCORD on the issue beyond complete silence,
    it is clear that for the time being at least, salvaging will be both a profession
    and unique form of what many see as piracy."
