- body: "![](http://www.eve-mercury.net/images/mercurybanner.png)  \n  \nToday marked
    the official entrance of Senator Vilard Garioss into the upcoming Federation Presidental
    race. Garioss made the announcement from his home system of Egghelende, surrounded
    by family and hundreds of supporters.  \n  \nFor weeks, speculation has run rampant
    as to the identities of candidates who would rise to challenge Jacus Roden in
    the historic election. Garioss is one of the first to emerge, perhaps spurred
    by the continued occupation of dozens of Gallente systems by Caldari militia forces.
    During Garioss's announcement, he pledged to end the war that has grown increasingly
    controversial.  \n  \n\"Our Federation has thrived in peacetime and advocated
    peaceful relations for decades. It was the folly of the previous administration
    and their obstinate refusal to swallow their pride and concede to moderate requests
    that has brought us to our current position. Our economy is falling, our people
    are suffering in the periphery. Continuing to be prideful and throw away lives
    and resources into a war that has become increasingly hopeless is the height of
    foolishness. We must turn the other cheek and return to the way of diplomacy that
    has made our Federation great. I am willing to pay a great price for peace and
    I believe the Federation is as well.\"  \n  \nAt 67 years of age, Vilard Garioss
    is one of the currently serving senators of the Nexus constellation. He has served
    eight consecutive terms, the first two terms as an Independent, the past six as
    a member of the Federal-Populist Party. Garioss has long advocated open economic
    policies with the other empires, as well as pushing for extended social liberties
    and increased public welfare projects. Prior to entering politics, Garioss served
    as a headmaster and professor of economics, mathematics, and psychology for the
    University of Caille."
