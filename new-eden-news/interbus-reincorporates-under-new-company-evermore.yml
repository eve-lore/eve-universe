    InterBus Reincorporates Under New Company EverMore\n\nOurapheh, Genesis \u2013
    InterBus has announced today that it will be reincorporating under a new parent
    company, EverMore. Just days after the death of InterBus's former CEO Haukkakka
    Pukara, newly appointed CEO Alexander Ducasse has announced an extensive restructuring
    of the corporation.\n\nInterBus was founded by the Amarr Empire, Caldari State,
    Gallente Federation, and Minmatar Republic to ensure open transportation of goods
    and people throughout the cluster. Under this new structure EverMore, a privately
    controlled entity, will become the majority owner of the formerly government-controlled
    corporation. InterBus has been experiencing a deadlock since representatives of
    the founding empires were unable to reach an agreement on the operational future
    of the company, following rising militia warzone conflict and the controversial
    activation of prototype stellar transmuters by the Amarr Empire. The restructuring
    of InterBus under EverMore will end that deadlock as InterBus becomes a private-public
    concern.\n\nRepresentatives of all four empires welcomed the restructuring deal
    in a joint announcement today saying that it will ensure the continued \"independence
    and neutrality\" of InterBus in uncertain times. The details of the deal have
    not been disclosed, but it is rumored that EverMore has paid significantly above
    market price for InterBus shares. A number of longer-serving InterBus executives
    resigned over the deal, stating that \"far from safeguarding InterBus's future,
    the empires have sacrificed it in order to fill their war coffers.\" \n\nAlexander
    Ducasse, CEO of InterBus and now President of EverMore, says that this change
    in management allows the New Eden transportation stalwart to \"crawl out from
    under the constraints of international politics and expand beyond its core mission.\"\n\n![alexander

    with Corporate Acquisitions and the Founding of New Companies\n\nOurapheh, Genesis
    \u2013 It was also announced today that EverMore's expanded operatios will include
    the acquisition of a number of corporations across New Eden. Inner Zone Shipping,
    Zero-G Research, Adaptive Provisioning, Villore Sec Ops, and the legendary Cromeaux
    Inc. cloning corporation are all slated to become EverMore companies upon completion
    of financing arrangements. The acquisition of these companies has been confirmed
    by their executive boards and will be finalized in approximately a month's time.\n\nThe
    purchase of these companies represents a significant diversification of EverMore's
    portfolio given only one falls under the traditional InterBus remit. \"EverMore
    is not just a rebranded InterBus\", its President informed us. \"EverMore will
    represent a new and innovative approach to the connections that bind the people
    of New Eden. As the InterBus consortium we provided reliable links between people
    regardless of their origins or their destination but were limited by government
    involvement. As we evolve into the EverMore corporate conglomerate we will take
    this same philosophy one step further. Our mission is simple: bring all things
    to all people.\"\n\nIn addition to purchasing these existing companies, EverMore
    is founding a host of new corporations. Verity Enhancements, an augmentation manufacturer
    for the average New Eden citizen, Vapor Sea Technologies, a cloud-based computing
    company, and the Interplanetary Media Network, a cluster-wide network of planetary
    news and entertainment media outlets. \n\nDucasse assured the Scope that, \"In
    this dark times, EverMore will show you the way to a brighter tomorrow. As we
    grow closer to fulfilling our dream for a better, more connected New Eden we hope
    you will all join us. Over the coming days, we have more announcements to follow.
    For Evermore, this is only the beginning.\"\n\n![samanuni athounon gate](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/1ZZvUwjQb67yIwcD2nsWRx/724126efc903821816b42d0149ac7b73/samanuni_athounon_gate.png)\n*Above:
