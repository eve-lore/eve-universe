    The Intaki government has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on several of Intaki Prime's
    largest cities following widespread riots and looting. The unrest comes in the
    wake of rumors spawned by Tibus Heth's recent memorandum, which states the Caldari
    will be auctioning off development and exploration rights to occupied Federation
    territories. Police and planetary defense troops are out in force on the streets
    and major media outlets have suspended normal broadcasting.\n\nSince the initial
    round of panic and protests that swept the Intaki homeworld when the system first
    fell to Caldari forces in March, life on Intaki Prime had largely returned to
    normal, despite growing shortages of goods not produced on the planet (primarily
    high-tech and heavy-industry products). Heth's memorandum, however, has given
    new life to fears of a violent Caldari occupation, similar to the one imposed
    on Caldari Prime for the last 14 months.\n\nThere has been a reported increase
    in hate crimes by Caldari supporters against Intaki Prime's ethnic Gallente population,
    though Intaki public safety officials say it is not of the \"epidemic\" proportions
    some have claimed it to be. A large number of Gallente are fleeing the cities,
    and while many have been offered shelter by Federation military bases, few have
    accepted. Analysts have attributed this largely to the Vielle de Tempete incident
    which took place a few months ago on Caldari Prime, in which thousands of Federation
    soldiers were orbitally bombarded by Caldari forces inside a fortified military
    base.\n\nThe Intaki assembly has promised to \"make the transition as smooth as
    possible,\" a statement many have claimed represents complete surrender to Caldari
    forces. Since Federation troops report to the Federation president, it is unclear
    whether they would obey the assembly if it ordered them to stand down. This uncertainty
    has contributed to the general populace's fears that widespread bloodshed may
    be imminent."
