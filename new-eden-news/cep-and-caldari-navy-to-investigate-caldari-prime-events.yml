    on [Caldari Prime](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Prime) and the crash
    of the Leviathan-class [titan](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Titans) Shiigeru
    on the planet. The investigation, which has been conducted until now under top
    security protocols, is nearing completion.


    Neither the Navy nor the CEP have announced what specific details they are investigating,
    instead saying, "We are conducting a broad analysis of the entire situation, from
    the highest levels of command to the very bottom."


    The CEP has extended its investigation to capsuleers involved in the assault and
    is asking any who participated and wish to provide testimony to contact Odo Hakaalen,
    the CEP''s capsuleer liaison. The CEP expects to complete the report within the
    next two weeks.


    The Gallente [Senate](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Senate) has requested
    that the CEP and Navy share the results of their findings, which the CEP has reportedly
    agreed to.'
