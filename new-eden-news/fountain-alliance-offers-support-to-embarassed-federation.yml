    stance on the theft of the Molyneux, the Fountain Alliance has offered their support
    to the Federation Navy in any attempts to recover it.   \n  \n\"Fountain Alliance
    welcomes the Federation into its space, and will do all that it can to aid the
    process of returning the Molyneux to its rightful owners. We hope those who have
    aided Serpentis corporation will be treated as they deserve in Federation territory
    from this point onwards.\"   \n  \n\"Our Alliance authorities also hold intelligence
    on corporations and factions that aided serpentis in capturing and securing the
    arrival of the Titan to The Serpentis Prime system and are willing to share this
    information with the Gallente Federation.\"   \n  \nYou can read this statement
    in full [here](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=179990)
    \  \n  \nFederation officials are yet to respond to this offer and no hint of
    any possible co-operation has been made by the Navy, but this soon after the announcement,
    and given the delicacy of this situation, that is not surprising."
