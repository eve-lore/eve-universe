- body: 'Uphallant - A civilian shipping convoy was attacked and destroyed in the
    Uphallant system yesterday when a patrol fleet belonging to Internal Security,
    Nugoeihuvi''s security arm, engaged the unarmed vessels after what Nugoeihuvi
    is calling a "miscommunication." At least 250 people are confirmed dead, with
    more than 600 passengers and crew missing.


    The civilian convoy, carrying machine parts, medicines, foodstuffs, and a number
    of passengers, was cleared to jump into Uphallant by Caldari authorities, says
    the convoy''s owner, Greater Placid Transstellar. "This wasn''t an accident,"
    said one GPTS captain who survived the attack. "We told Internal Security we were
    cleared by Caldari customs, but they ordered us to surrender immediately. This
    was piracy, plain and simple."


    The rapid Caldari military advance into Gallente space has spread Caldari Navy
    forces thin, forcing the Navy to outsource patrol duties in less critical systems
    to the megacorporate security forces. While the Navy has attempted to avoid interfering
    with civilian traffic, the additional bureaucracy introduced by going through
    multiple chains of command and often conflicting rules of engagement has resulted
    in some "communications difficulties," according to the Navy press office. In
    this case, says Oraki Hiekilen, a Caldari Customs Authority spokesman, "Internal
    Security appears to have missed the convoy''s customs authorization."


    For its part, Internal Security is maintaining its innocence in the matter. "The
    convoy refused to allow Internal Security forces to board their ships, and as
    a result we were forced to open fire," said the company in a press release. "However,
    we are reexamining our policies and assisting with rescue and recovery operations."'
