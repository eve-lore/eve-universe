    - Fourteen security teams left their posts at the Fedmart Retail Center in Anchauttes,
    and several more have stated their intention to do so tomorrow. Gilbin Doyle,
    spokesman for the Anchauttes Security Union, explained: \"We are understaffed
    and underpaid. We have substandard equipment and poorly managed dispatch systems.
    We can't afford to let this continue. Lai Dai starts moving into our system in
    less than two weeks, and we're going to see a notable rise in domestic disturbances
    and a higher potential for terrorism. Fedmart has not taken these problems into
    account.\"\n\nSecurity details have announced plans to walk off the job on a rotating
    schedule until Fedmart meets their expectations, including equipment, communications,
    and health-care improvements as well as a staffing budget increase.  \n  \nA Fedmart
    spokesman told reporters, \"We're currently in talks with Anchauttes Security
    and hope to reach a compromise before Lai Dai starts moving in.\"  \n  \nLocal
    resident Darlynee Garmyre told reporters, \"They waited until we were most vulnerable,
    and now we have no choice but to give them what they want or let this place collapse
    into anarchy.\" Garmyre had been assaulted during a robbery earlier in the day
    and claimed to have waited over an hour for an officer to arrive at the scene.
    \ \n  \nUnofficial surveys indicate that Anchauttes residents and businesspeople
    are highly anxious about the social clashes that are likely to occur when the
    Caldari move in."
