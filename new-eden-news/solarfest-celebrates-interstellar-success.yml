    Beautiful Nightmares: SolarFest Creativity Unleashed\nParagon has hosted an exhibition
    of ship SKINs created by independent artists to mark their first ever SolarFest.
    These artistic efforts were just one part of Paragon\u2019s interstellar arts
    festival, a celebration of creativity in New Eden dedicated to Paragon\u2019s
    artistic platform SKINR.\n\nPilots took to the skies in Nightmare-class ships
    re-coated in glorious colors. Their new SKINs were made by the noted capsuleer
    designers Alex Tow, Kradick Khan, Sven Bauer, Tyr Raez, and Zoey Kaizar. A product
    of Sansha\u2019s Nation, the sight of a Nightmare is normally an omen of great
    fear and horror in New Eden, but these battleships had been reclaimed as beautiful
    expressions of the artists' talents.\n\nThe pilots roamed all across nullsec,
    beginning in Querious where they were destroyed in an engagement with the resident
    alliance OnlyFleets. Returning in fresh clones, they headed north to Vale of the
    Silent and Tribute, where they fought in a protracted skirmish against local capsuleers.
    After that, they headed west to fight The Initiative in Fountain, then finally
    east to Etherium Reach, where Pandemic Horde made quick work of the artistic flyers.
    Watch GalNet\u2019s broadcast for full coverage of the event.\n\n![SolarFest Planets](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/1P7U86cF9GuQXN7itZghIN/b2543207f9c3cea653e539ffe35213c1/SolarFest_Planets.png)\n###
    Inter-Planetary Festival Largest in History\nWhile these beautiful ships engaged
    amongst the stars, planetary colonies across the cluster hosted musical concerts,
    engineering showcases, and artistic exhibitions. With events taking place on hundreds
    of planets, SolarFest is New Eden\u2019s largest ever festival.\n\nOn Amarr, Paragon\u2019s
    IRIS welcomed to the stage acclaimed soloists Ameyn Jural and Louwi Kil. The two

    performance of the Sarum Symphony fifteen years ago. They performed Maritak\u2019s
    latest composition, Spectrum Dawn, written for the festival. This sweeping epic
    honors the many stars that make up the Amarrian Empire.\n\nOn a shielded platform
    amongst the clouds of the storm planet Teonusude II, Ruhste troops convened for
    a three-day dance competition. Held in partnership with the Vherokior tribe, the
    \u201CSolar Sail Dance Championship\u201D hosted over a thousand dancers from
    every tribe of the Republic. IRIS opened the ceremony with a speech dedicated
    to the history of the art form. quashing false rumors that the poet Crofton had
    refused to participate in the event.\n\nOn Caldari Prime, a joint Gallente-Caldari
    peace concert was opened by duelling suraiiko players. The concert celebrated
    the joint history of the Luminaire star system with artists from both of the planet\u2019s
    major cultures. IRIS joined the players, displaying her own technical brilliance
    on the suraiiko to the crowd's amazement.\n\nWhile there are too many events to
    mention all by name, Paragon\u2019s IRIS told media outlets at the company\u2019s
    headquarters in Ourapheh that she was \u201Cproud to be a part of a corporation
    that is so dedicated to artists from so many worlds\u201D.\n\n__*Disclosure: The
