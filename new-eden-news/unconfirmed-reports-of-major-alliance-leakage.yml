- body: "Reports have been filtering in that the known terrorist organisation \"United
    against Decadence and Impurity\" (UDI), has obtained some highly sensitive documents,
    which if true, means that the Ushra\u2019Kahn alliance has suffered a major security
    leak.   \n  \nThe documents are rumoured to contain not only the identities of
    a large portion of the members of the Ushra\u2019Kahn, but their most commonly
    used ships, the setups and what stations their agents inhabit. It goes on to name
    all of the corporations in the alliance, along with their supporting non-alliance
    corporations and what systems they tend to inhabit.   \n  \nIt is unclear immediately
    what effect this news will have on the internal structure of the Ushra\u2019Kahn,
    or how the information even managed to fall into the hands of a terrorist organisation
    as prominent as the UDI. Theories range from defecting Ushra\u2019Kahn members
    to a chance salvage from a ship wreck in decaying orbit.   \n  \nDue to the secretive
    nature of the UDI, we have been unable to get in contact with any of their members
    for comments, but these reports, if true could spell disaster for the growing
    alliance. There is no telling what uses the UDI could put that information to."
