- body: "**PERIMETER** \u2013 Con artists have been executing increasingly successful
    scams against unsuspecting ship captains, many of which leave victims with no
    legal recourse. \u201CPeople have to learn how to protect themselves,\u201D said
    a Concord detective, who requested that his name be withheld from publication.
    \u201CThese matchstick guys aren\u2019t breaking any laws per se\u2014they\u2019re
    just successful at convincing the unwary to take completely unnecessary and often
    times outrageous risks.\u201D  \n\n\nIn one such scam, a relatively inactive member
    of a larger corporation begged and pleaded for isk on the CORP channel, claiming
    that he was \u201Cstarting over from scratch\u201D. He said he could quickly repay
    any takers so long as he was loaned enough to acquire some single-run battleship
    blueprints from a \u201Cclose friend\u201D, who was allegedly selling them to
    him at prices far below the current market value as a favor to \u201Chelp him
    get back on his feet\u201D. The scammer then promised a 50 percent return on investment
    to anyone that made a donation, citing that he\u2019d have no problems selling
    the single-run battleship copies at their market value within a day or two. After
    a prolonged period of uncomfortable silence followed by a few \u201CC\u2019mon
    guys, give me a break\u201D routines, someone finally succumbed to guilt-induced
    sympathy and gave several million isk to the \u201Cfellow corpmate\u201D with
    all the genuine intentions of helping him and also believing that he\u2019d be
    earning a nice isk return for doing so. The very next day, all corporation members
    conveniently received an automated corporate notification informing them of the
    scammer\u2019s \u201Cuntimely death\u201D.  \n\n\nIn another scam, victims are
    convinced to accept courier missions as a way to execute transactions for battleships.
    In this scheme, the con artist tells the unsuspecting buyer that the collateral
    for the courier mission is the \u201Csale price\u201D of the battleship they think
    they\u2019re about to purchase. When the buyer accepts the mission and pays the
    collateral, they open the gigantic package only to find a massive heap of veldspar
    or a much smaller ship, often times an industrial-class vessel.  \n\n\n\u201CThe
    \u2018mission impossible\u2019 scam is my favorite,\u201D said the detective.
    \u201CThese gullible skippers get duped into accepting missions that are either
    extremely difficult or outright impossible to accomplish just because they have
    an attractive payout. These guys don\u2019t realize that once they accept, the
    collateral is wired right out of their account, no questions asked. And the contents
    of what they\u2019re allegedly hauling are sealed. The courier mission system
    is set up with the assumption that you know what you\u2019re doing when you accept
    a mission\u2014and that also implies that you trust the person offering it. No
    laws are broken when you decide to take on a mission that can\u2019t be done,
    and you have no recourse when things don\u2019t go your way.\u201D  \n\n\nAsked
    about some advice on how to avoid scams, the detective answered \u201CWell for
    starters, only use the trade system available at all stations to conduct transactions
    for items. Also, don\u2019t ever take a courier mission unless you trust the person
    offering it. It\u2019s a great tool for corporations to parcel out work that needs
    to be done as part of everyday business. Beyond that, always remember that you
    assume all of the risk when you agree to a mission. If you see a big reward for
    a courier mission, odds are that it\u2019s too good to be true.\u201D  \n\n\nWhen
    questioned about some blueprint thefts that have been reported recently, the detective
    wouldn\u2019t go into very much detail. \u201CThat\u2019s a whole different story,
    and it\u2019s one that I\u2019m not going to elaborate very much on\u2014except
    to say that we\u2019re relentlessly going after people that knowingly steal from
    others using exploitive techniques that can\u2019t be countered via conventional
    means. And so long as you\u2019re going to print that, also print this warning:
    Be damn careful who you give hangar access to.\u201D  \n\n\nThe detective declined
    further comment."
