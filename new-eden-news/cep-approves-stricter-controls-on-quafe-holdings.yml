    - The Chief Executive Panel met again today to discuss the Caldari Providence
    Directorate's petition to revoke Quafe Company's corporate status. The panel concluded
    to postpone further consideration until a future, as yet unspecified, date, but
    a motion was approved to implement stricter auditing of Quafe operations within
    State borders.  \n  \nQuafe Company is one of the largest corporations in New
    Eden and is allowed to operate in the State as a domestic company, subject to
    the same laws, regulations, and protections as Caldari corporations. The company
    has a history of cooperating with Caldari business regulations, and thus far no
    evidence of criminal intent has been presented.  \n  \nIkane Hadonei, a member
    of Wiyrkomi Corporation's CEP delegation, said, \"Approving the petition's motion
    at this time seems like a misappropriation of resources. However, if Quafe does
    pose a problem, these additional audit measures will ensure we'll have adequate
    time to respond.\"  \n  \nThe House of Records has already begun implementing
    the new controls, but a spokesperson indicated the additional data would not \"immediately
    paint a clearer picture\" of the Gallente firm. Quafe officials, meanwhile, appear
    content with the decision. \"We have no objections and would be happy to assist
    the State,\" Agencourt Ambrulle said, adding, \"There is no question the audit
    will have a favorable outcome for Quafe.\""
