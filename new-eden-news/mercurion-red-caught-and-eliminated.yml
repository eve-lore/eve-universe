- body: "Yesterday a large group of pilots were rallied by CONCORD to help in the
    capture of the terrorist Mercurion Red. The chase centered on the border between
    the regions Verge Vendor and Genesis, close to Yulai. Mercurion Red, a known Guristas
    terrorist was finally caught after two hours of intense chasing, in the Yulai
    system. The pilots Wuagwan, Hardcore Pawn and ragnaR lodbroK were amongst the
    people who brought her covert operations frigate down. Unfortunately another pilot
    who was unaware that Mercurion Red had to be captured alive opened fire on the
    pod which resulted in her swift death. Earlier, two other Guristas pilots were
    discovered assisting Mercurion Red in her escape. Both were swiftly destroyed
    by the fleet chasing her.   \n  \nMercurion Red's corpse was retrieved and CONCORD
    has stated that half the bounty will be paid out for the effort of stopping the
    wanted terrorist flee Empire space, additional bounties will also be paid out
    to those responsible for the destruction of the Guristas support ships in the
    process. Mercurion Reds corpse will be examined to verify her identity. The nature
    of her crimes allowed a court ordered clone suspension to make sure that she did
    not ressurect. Scientists hope that intelligence about her operations can be extracted
    from the remains.   \n  \nDuring a press conference Commander Plavers thanked
    all pilots that assisted in the capture, \"I would like to commend the pilots
    for their resourcefulness, fast adaptation and clever man\u0153uvres that helped
    us stop another criminal from committing more acts of terrorism against the Empires\"."
