- body: "Pator \u2013 A long-range Republic Fleet patrol near the Heimatar \u2013
    Derelik border claimed a victory over a slave convoy today. While that alone is
    usually a cause for celebration in Fleet rec clubs, this particular convoy had
    an unexpected cargo \u2013 nearly two dozen survivors of the failed pilgrimage
    to find the Minmatar Elders. \n\nThe survivors are still under Fleet purview and
    are not being made available for media questioning. They are officially listed
    as Held Indefinitely for both medical and psychological evaluation and treatment.
    Fleet representatives state they will be notifying and transporting next-of-kin
    to the survivors\u2019 current location. \n\nWhat is known is that the twenty
    two survivors are all young women and were apparently captured by a rogue pirate
    element in the Great Wildlands prior to being sold to an independent slave trader.
    \n\nExperts on slave trade practices speculate the surviving pilgrims are likely
    the \u201Csaleable\u201D ones of whatever population was captured initially, being
    of breeding age and in generally good health. The same experts went on to say
    that unfortunately, the remaining prisoners were likely either left in the wreckage
    or \u201Chumanely dispatched\u201D depending on the preferences of particular
    group that found them. \n\nRepresentatives for the remaining families of the pilgrims
    declined to make any comment on the situation."
