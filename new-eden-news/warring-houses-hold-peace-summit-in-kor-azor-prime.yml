- body: "AMARR - Monday saw representatives of the Houses Darabi and Miyan meet in
    Kor-Azor Prime for talks to settle the recent hostilities between them. The peace
    talks were chaired by capsuleer Ashar KorAzor. The summit was attended by numerous
    pod pilots from corporations operating across Amarr space and elsewhere. \n\nQuickly
    settling down, Iraj Darabi, the Holder of House Darabi allowed Ambassador Kaselia
    to outline their objectives for the summit. These included a full apology by House
    Miyan to Iraj's daughter Mina, to the citizens of House Darabi, and a full apology
    to House Darabi for slander. Along with these demands, House Darabi also footed
    a bill of five billion ISK in costs during the short war. \n\nIn response, Ambassador
    Spoor, speaking on behalf of Holder Toraj Miyan attacked the intentions of Mina
    Darabi, and accused Holder Darabi of sending his daughter \"to provoke a response
    that would provide a reason for war.\" House Miyan demanded a full and public
    apology to the claims made by House Darabi, and a sum of seven billion ISK to
    be paid in reparations to House Miyan. In keeping with Amarr tradition, House
    Darabi would become a vassal house under House Miyan. \n\nBoth houses also made
    territorial demands, House Darabi laid claim to the Nebian system, while House
    Miyan wished for House Darabi to be removed completely from the system. \n\nAs
    the demands were laid out, the discussion fired, with Commodore Harkan, one of
    House Miyan's fleet personnel confronting Mina Darabi directly. In the resulting
    scuffle, Mina Darabi was fainted, and security personnel moved in to calm the
    situation. The talks ended in gridlock, with a 48 hour ceasefire in place while
    Iraj Darabi and Mina Darabi remained in Kor-Azor prime to recover from the summit.
    \n\nSoon after the summit, an industrial transporter from Darabi was attacked
    by Miyan forces lead by Captain Burr. Burr suspected the transporter was carrying
    military equipment, but could not offer proof for his assertions. Toraj Miyan
    removed Captain Burr from command and House Miyan. However, House Darabi considered
    this attack a violation of the ceasefire, and hostilities recommenced between
    House Miyan and House Darabi."
