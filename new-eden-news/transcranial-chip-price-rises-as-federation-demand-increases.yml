- body: "The price of the highly controversial Transcranial Microcontrollers has risen
    considerably in the last few days as demand increases from a surprising source
    - the Gallente Federation. The chips, manufactured by the Caldari Ishukone Corporation,
    have until now mainly been in demand in the Khanid Kingdom, where they are used
    to pacify slaves. But the chips can be programmed in various ways, as the idle
    rich within the Federation have found out. The chips have become a huge fad amongst
    the social elite and 'chip parties' are the newest rave, where people randomly
    draw a chip from a bowl as they enter. Of course, the chips are programmed differently
    than those used by the Dark Amarr, usually involving a fetish of some sort, lurid
    fantasies and id alterations.  \n  \nIn addition, reports indicate that some Gallenteans
    are now using the chips to slightly alter their perception of themselves, making
    them think they are younger, more attractive or more popular than they really
    are. Though many frown upon this practice, psychiatrists say this helps people
    deal with self-esteem issues, a rampant problem in a society that values youth
    and beauty above everything else."
