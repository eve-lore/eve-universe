- body: "Gallente President Souro Foiritan has pulled of a real coup by convincing
    Articio Kor-Azor to give up the Crielere scientists he recently bought. A deal
    was struck in the early hours of the morning after prolonged discussions between
    Federation diplomats and representatives of the royal heir. Details of this deal
    are still sketchy, but are thought to include trade and mining rights, tech exchange
    and intelligence cooperation. Early reports indicate that Articio may have overstepped
    the informal boundaries set by the Emperor regarding the extent of agreements
    Amarr citizens may make with foreigners, but the office of the Imperial Chamberlain
    declined to comment when contacted on the matter.   \n  \nThe two scientists,
    the Gallentean Touvolle and Umailen the Caldari, are to be released in the next
    few days, as soon as the paperwork can be cleared up. The pair was sent to the
    newly erected research labs somewhere in the Kor-Azor region, but had not yet
    started work."
