- body: "Tensions were high in the Imperial Court today when the representatives of
    two different Heir families argued over accusations of improper trade practices
    and sabotage.\n\nIn a statement made to the Court, Cerda Bashatar, patriarch of
    Kor-Azor scion House Bashatar, announced that investigations into a series of
    acts of sabotage upon his House\u2019s assets committed over the last twelve months
    had revealed evidence linking these acts to House Torash, a scion family of the
    Tash-Murkon.\n\n\u201CIt is my belief,\u201D stated Cerda, \u201Cthat Gavit Torash
    has wilfully conspired to undermine my House and its ability to contribute to
    the economy and the health of the Empire. Furthermore he has employed and consorted
    with criminals in a blatant disregard for tradition and Imperial law.\u201D\n\nIn
    support of these accusations House Bashatar submitted to the Court several items
    of circumstantial evidence concerning records of payments made to mercenary capsuleers
    by associates of House Torash, and the origins of munitions used in recent attacks
    upon the family\u2019s trade convoys. In addition, Cerda Bashatar inferred that
    the timing of Torash sales of goods over the last year were deliberately orchestrated
    to weaken his own House's position in the markets.\n\nWhen Gavit Torash himself
    stepped forward to vehemently deny the accusations made against his House, the
    two representatives began a heated argument which led to an exchange of offensive
    and derogatory language. When it became apparent that both men might come to blows
    they were separated by Imperial guardsmen, and then detained and reprimanded for
    their shocking breaches of protocol.\n\nThis is not the first time that the two
    Houses have been at odds, and the rivalry of the respective heads of each family
    is well known, dating back a decade to Cerda Bashatar\u2019s political marriage
    to Idrina Garmond, second-cousin of Articio Kor-Azor, a lady that Gavit Torash
    had previously been courting.\n\nNeither is it the first time that either House
    has courted controversy. Gavit Torash\u2019s ascendancy to power after the death
    of his father two years ago is still a subject of some speculation at the Imperial
    Court, and House Bashatar was treated at arm\u2019s length for several months
    by many when it was discovered that Petras Bashatar, brother of Cerda, was involved
    in the recent revival of the ill-fated Tetrimon cult.\n\nAfter the fracas Deputy
    Chamberlain Jadrow Sershath called for an immediate recess of today's Court proceedings,
    but before he did so he chided both the Kor-Azor and the TashMurkon for the behaviour
    of their underlings. It is not yet known how seriously the evidence presented
    today will be taken, and whether the Court will rule for further investigation
    into the allegations."
