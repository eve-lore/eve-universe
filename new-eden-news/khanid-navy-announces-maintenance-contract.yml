    Khanid Prime - The Royal Khanid Navy, in conjunction with Wiyrkomi, announced
    a massive maintenance program for the upkeep of its fleet.


    Under the terms of the contract, Wiyrkomi have been loaned a maintenance facility
    within the Royal Khanid Navy shipyards in Kihtaled.  The contract has a fixed
    term of three years, with a possible rolling end-date should the contract be fulfilled
    to the Navy''s satisfaction.  Wiyrkomi are to take control of the scheduled maintenance
    of the Fusion Thruster components for all the Khanid Navy fleet.


    The Khanid Navy hopes that this maintenance program will give their aging fleet
    greater serviceability figures at a lower price than keeping an internal maintenance
    facility.


    Wiyrkomi played down the significance of this contract. according to a company
    spokesman,  "This is standard maintenance practice in all modern fleet management
    models. It will allow our customer greater flexibility at a competitive price."'
