- body: '_Tash-Murkon Prime - _Sources within the [Tash-Murkon Family](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tash-Murkon
    Family) say [Catiz Tash-Murkon](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Catiz Tash-Murkon)
    has given some thought to backing [Merimeth Sarum''s](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Merimeth
    Sarum) calls for the proper launch of the [Reclaiming](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Reclaiming).
    The [Heir](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Amarr Heirs) has reportedly been
    conferring with the [Empress](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Amarr Emperor)
    for several days, discussing the economic and political impact the Reclaiming
    would have on the [Empire](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Amarr), for both
    good and ill. Additionally, Catiz has met with several [Imperial Navy](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Amarr
    Navy) admirals to hear their opinions on the Empyrean War and potential renewed
    escalation.


    According to the sources, the Tash-Murkon position is that the Empire is likely
    in a position of greater strength than at any time since the [Minmatar Rebellion](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Minmatar
    Rebellion), while the [Minmatar Republic](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Minmatar)
    appears to be beginning a possible upswing in power. It also contends that the
    Empire may find itself in need of fresh slave stock within a few generations,
    having not acquired significant numbers since the original conquest of the Minmatar
    nearly a thousand years ago.


    Sources within the Imperial Navy claim Grand Admiral [Kezti Sundara](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Kezti
    Sundara) is carefully considering the words of the Tash-Murkon and [Sarum](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sarum
    Family) heirs and has called counsel with his fleet admirals. It is currently
    unknown what position the Grand Admiral takes on the possible escalation of the
    conflict.


    Reports from the Imperial court paint the mood as tense. The Empress has apparently
    refrained from making clear whether and how she is being swayed by the words of
    her nephew or Catiz Tash-Murkon. The other members of the [Privy Council](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Privy
    Council) have been engaged in heated debates about the suggestion, but reports
    are conflicting regarding who has taken what stance.'
