    Eden, capsuleers are reminded to watch out for Blood Raider threats. The Sani
    Sabik, a heretical offshoot of the Amarr religion, have been known to favor clone
    targets. Reports have already emerged of Raider fleets stealing warclone blanks
    from their long-time foes, the Order of St. Tetrimon. The Order were only brought
    back into the Amarrian fold after the Great Rebellion, but are zealous opponents
    of the Raiders.\n\nThe Blood Raiders have called on all faithful to join their
    hunt, while the Order invites lawful capsuleers to pledge support in their fight
    against the bloodthirsty cult.\n![shrouded structure](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/PBpsDyaYO49y6acJEx5hB/9451d1d073992cc1d082e8d0f012a8b7/shrouded.png)\n\nMeanwhile,
    we have another report from Hana Shikari, our source within the Fulcrum, ready
    to update us on the aftermath of the recent siege.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Scope cannot
    verify the veracity of this individual\u2019s account of events and their opinions
    do not represent the opinions of the Scope. We trust that our readers have the
    capacity to decide for themselves what is an appropriate degree of skepticism
    to apply to the following narrative.\n\n### Zarzakh Report: After the Siege\n\nTomorrow
    in Altrinur at 15:00 a mystery begins to unravel. Until then, a vital spark has
    returned to this den of iniquity.\n\nSince the empyreans broke the Drifter siege,
    our system overflows once more with the essential distractions necessary for our
    continued existence. The emanation lock has disrupted the free movement of humanity
    through Zarzakh, but not illicit goods. If birds flew under our metallic sky they
    would surely be happily chirping away overhead while the lawless below whistled
    along. \n\nSo the great megalodons of New Eden have swam back out to the depths
    of wormhole space leaving our diving cages rattled but our limbs intact. Everyone,
    from pirate kings to humble narcotics smugglers is happy to ignore the unimaginable
    horror of their inevitable retaliation. Deeper shadows are cast by rumors that
    the only thing that saved us was the revelation that our benefactor is not entirely
    in control of the unfathomable station we inhabit, which it turns out is capable
    of acts previously considered impossible.\n\nBut as these existential concerns
    slip to the back of the mind, more precedented nightmares stalking the stars have
    been able to return. The Blood Raiders have begun their annual hunt and one in
    three vessels that docks carries the scars of a recent meeting with the followers
    of Omir Sarikusa. Hrada-Oki research supply vessels are especially popular with
    the Raiders, though what interest the Red God has in the Circle\u2019s machinations
    is beyond my non-existent status.\n\nI am of course skipping around the most curious
    development of all, a new denizen as invisible in this missive as it is in our
    space. I plied a transient identity salesman with a couple of bottles of moonshine
    and a few vials of frentix in exchange for a discreet fly-by. Its body lies hidden,
    but its edges are written in lightning. A thing of storms revealed through conflict.
    Even I can spot a bad omen when it\u2019s kilometers long.\n\nCaravanmaster Malaya
    Hrada has extended an invitation to the capsuleers of New Eden to assist her clanfolk
    in beginning the process of uncovering the secrets of this thunderous mystery.
    I know that because everybody does, I am no longer invited to the Hrada dice games.
    I suspect Malaya may be a closeted subscriber to the Scope and not a fan of my
    last submission. Either that or she has grown tired of my bad luck and shallow
    pockets. \n\nIt was a rogue dockhand with bushy eyebrows and loose lips who informed
    me that they will gather in Altrinur tomorrow at 15:00, not my former creditors.
    I suppose it will not be too long after that we discover whether her trust in
    the capsuleers was well placed.\n\nThis may well be my last missive, as the narrowed
    eyes I catch glaring at me around the corners of my usual drinking spots indicate
    that our ignoble Carvanmaster may not be your only subscription holder within
    the Fulcrum. If I am unable to deliver further insights know that I died as lived;
    telling somebody who did not care to listen something they did not want to hear.\n\n###
