- body: 'Amarr - A ''Salvation Crusade'' from Amarr to Pator was declared yesterday
    by Minmatar preacher Abel Jarek, at a public meeting held in the main concourse
    of the Emperor Family Academy in Amarr. Jarek, a Cleric in the Salvation Church
    of Blessed Servitude, an authorized branch of the Amarrian Church serving slave
    populations, announced his intention to gather a "flock of righteous Minmatar
    and take the Word of God to our brothers in Pator."


    Speaking to a crowd of several hundred former slaves, Cleric Jarek gave thanks
    to "Our Holy Empress Jamyl, who in Her divine wisdom has brought so many of our
    people into the light." He went on to express his belief that he and others had
    been freed so that they might "spread the word to all the people of Minmatar and
    bring them into the Holy Empire of God."


    At the close of his sermon, Jarek invited all present to join him on a "Salvation
    Crusade from Holy Amarr to Pator." Station authorities confirmed that 214 Minmatar
    accompanied Jarek aboard a chartered transport that left an hour after the meeting
    broke up.


    Abel Jarek has been a noted figure in the Salvation Church for 23 years and gained
    his freedom under the terms of Empress Jamyl I''s emancipation edict. While not
    an ordained priest, Jarek came to the attention of the Theology Council for his
    work among slave populations and was awarded clerical status. High levels of voluntary
    conversion among slaves in the domains of House Sarum are attributed in part to
    Jarek''s work and he has the patronage of several leading members of that royal
    family.'
