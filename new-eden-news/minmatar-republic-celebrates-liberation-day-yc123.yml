    the 143rd anniversary of the start of the Great Rebellion in BYC20. The festivities
    are being accompanied by nearly two weeks of celebratory Liberation Games, in
    which the seven tribes' capsuleers will compete for the honor of determining which
    tribe will control a new station in orbit of Matar for the first year of operations.
    The Tribal Council has determined that the new station to mark Minmatar liberation
    will have its administration determined each year in the games..\n\n*Above: Liberation
    Day Holovisual Broadcast by Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor*\n\n The Tribal Council has
    also ordered the broadcast of an address by Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor including
    a holovisual reproduction of scenes from the old Minmatar Empire, Amarr invasion
    and occupation, and the Great Rebellion. Minmatar archaeologists, historians,
    and cultural experts were heavily involved in the creation of the holovid by the
    Republic's top cinematics circle, the Grar'Olro Lightpainters. As so often in
    the past, Minmatar capsuleers are holding their own celebratory events [today,
    beginning in the Pator system at 17.30 New Eden standard time](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/celebrate-minmatar-liberation-day-support-freedom-throughout-new-eden/316744).\n\n[![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/tribal_tournament_yc123.png)](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/celebrate-minmatar-liberation-day-support-freedom-throughout-new-eden/316744)\n\n
    As with previous Liberation Day celebrations, a number of fleets representing
    the Seven Tribes of Matar have assembled in parade formation across Minmatar space.
    Participants in the festivities are free to visit these fleets and celebrate with
    fireworks. The Liberation Games themselves also include a tour of key sites in
    the history of the Great Rebellion and the Minmatar Republic, including the Eternal
    Flame and the site of the final victory at the Battle of Fort Kavad.\n\n The Tribal
    Council's new Orbital Caravanserai has also been completed, with a memorial statue
    to the late Ray of Matar, Prime Minister and Sebiestor Chief Karin Midular under
    construction. The Brutor Tribe have also sponsored and begun construction of a
    statue of the late Captain Karishal Muritor, former Republic Fleet commander and
    leader of the Defiants freedom fighter group.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/altrinur_rfs_jormal_kehok.png)
    \ \n\n*Above: RFS Jormal Kehok parade fleet in Altrinur \u2013 Thukker Mix station
    in background*\n\n Liberation Games events include special semi-holographic environments
    and combat drones designed to re-enact key battles from the Great Rebellion, the
    Battle of Auner and the Mahti Jailbreak. Participants in these sites will play
    the part of the Minmatar rebels, and other sites celebrate the efforts of Minmatar
    resistance fighters to gain essential intelligence on Amarr operations during
    the rebellion.\n\n In addition, the Tribal Council intends to authorize those
    who have completed the tour of Minmatar history to enter the Abyssal Proving Grounds
    as part of the Liberation Games. Sources close to Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor suggest
    that tenuous and erratic diplomatic contact with the Triglavian Collective has
    been attempted, and led to an \"opportunity to show the Triglavians what the best
    Minmatar capsuleer fighters can do.\" The Scope's sources indicate that an Abyssal
    Proving Ground using *Rifter*-class frigates in a \"glorification proving\" will
    open on July 16th.\n\n Members of the Minmatar military circles who sent troops
    and pilots to support EDENCOM efforts during the invasion are reported to have
    reacted to this development with \"mixed views.\" In one bizarre incident following
    the news, a Khumaak displaying a holographic image of the EDENCOM logo was planted
    in the grounds of the Great Caravanserai with a message in Kul-Brutor script tied
    to the haft reading: \"We have already shown the Trigs what we can do!\"\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/orbital_caravanserai.png)

    Warzone**\n\n Despite the ongoing occupation of numerous Minmatar systems in the
    militia warzone by Amarr forces, with fresh gains recently scored by the 24th
    Imperial Crusade, the Tribal Council's order to reinforce key planets and bases
    is being carried out as best it can by stealth and with light squadrons of ships.
    The role of the Thukker Tribe in delivering essential supplies via wormhole and
    drop to Floseswin IV has been noted in particular. Operations on Floseswin IV
    itself continue as remaining Amarr forces continue a guerilla action, supported
    by drops from the Imperial Navy and occasional bombing operations.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/audesder_alliance_barracks.png)
    \ \n\n*Above: Minmatar defensive positions in Audesder system \u2013 tensions
    high along border with Mandate*\n\n The besieged planet of Floseswin IV remains
    a matter of serious concern to the Republic's military planners as intelligence
    indicates continuing rebuilding of Amarr fleets and their deployment to positions
    along the border. Republic Fleet forces are themselves building up at the Amo-Hror
    and Abudban-Odatrik defense zones. Tensions also remain high at the border with
    the Ammatar Mandate, with the highly militarized Audesder and Kenobanala systems
    reinforced by the Minmatar Republic and Amarr Empire respectively.\n\n Amarr conduct
    over Floseswin IV continues to divide military experts, with outside observers
    unclear on the driving force behind continued interest in the planet. The opaque
    politics of the Imperial Court have become even more difficult to analyse as the
    ongoing hunt for heretics and subversives occupies the ruling nobility. House
    Sarum and House Ardishapur have notably increased their military forces and established
    a number of new bases, with co-operation at an all time high between two powers
    that have often been rivals for influence over militant and traditionalist factions
    within the Amarr Empire.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/komo_ix_perun_clade_proving_complex.png)
