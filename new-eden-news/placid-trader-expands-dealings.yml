- body: "Apparently unfazed by the now unbridled public speculation surrounding his
    activities, and the mounting bounty placed on his head by various capsuleer organisations,
    having ostensibly judged his actions as detrimental to their representative factions;
    Jevako Niedboux has placed several more buy orders along Placid trade routes yet
    again demanding additional quantities of the now infamous Caldari officer insignias
    and small arms caches. He also requested several thousand more marines at prices
    far in excess of those offered last Friday.   \n  \nAs opportunistic mercenaries
    and traders alike flock to the Placid region to take advantage of the dealer\u2019s
    seemingly limitless funds, and the equally generous offers from members of the
    capsuleer community for his death. No sightings of the trader have been reported
    since he first began these unusual transactions three weeks ago.   \n  \nSurprisingly,
    there are no records of Jevako Niedboux docking at any of the stations where his
    market orders have appeared over the last three weeks, nor have any individuals
    matching his description appeared on security footage around the market terminals
    of these busy trading posts. Reacting to this, one local merchant suggested that
    Niedboux could be making use of the latest market technology to place these orders
    remotely from space or from other stations within the region.   \n  \nIn a further
    twist, Niedboux\u2019s name has reportedly appeared on several transaction logs
    within the Devoid region, where he has apparently been acquiring further numbers
    of marines as well as large quantities of Minmatar Fleet officer and midshipman
    insignia\u2019s. These dealings in Devoid became more apparent today when Niedboux
    amended his orders as before, requesting further quantities of the aforementioned
    items. Also, in a late and perhaps unsettling addition, tens of thousands of slaves.
    \  \n  \nCustoms officials within the Placid region were reluctant to offer any
    conjecture as to how Jevako Niedboux was able to travel un-noticed between Placid
    and Devoid in view of the high profile his recent actions have afforded him. One
    source within Gallente customs did state that he was presumed to be travelling
    under an alias name, as many individuals, frequently being capsule pilots would
    often do to avoid unwanted attention. The source did not however comment on the
    latest rumours that Niedboux has been making use of significant connections within
    smuggling rings such as the much debated Intaki Syndicate to travel out of sight."
