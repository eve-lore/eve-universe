- body: "**Tama** \\- Approximately three days ago, a Federal Defence Union carrier
    was destroyed in Heydieles. On the evening of the 28th, the FDU returned the favour
    by destroying **SIX** State Protectorate carriers in a little over 30 minutes
    in the Tama system. \n\nTwo State carriers were sighted smartbombing everything
    in range at the station in Tama. Some speculate as to whether this was a baiting
    tactic, as the carriers warped to the Nourvukaiken gate when a Federal fleet moved
    to engage them. The Federal fleet, mostly made up of Invicta and Einherjar Rising
    corporation members, followed the carriers and engaged them at the gate. \n\nOnce
    combat was initiated, four more carriers of the State Protectorate were cyno jumped
    into the combat zone along with a small support fleet following in from Nourvukaiken.
    The support fleet was easily wiped out and concentration was shifted to the carriers.
    Members of the FDU fleet called in more pilots from their brothers in the Cry
    Havoc and Pandemic Legion alliances. This combined force destroyed two carriers
    and was able to keep the remaining carriers pinned down until reinforcements from
    a roaming gang led by JLBane arrived. This additional damage helped break the
    chain of remote repair aid that the carriers were providing each other. \n\nIn
    an example of brilliant tactical thinking, Lucas Avignon led several pod pilots
    that were being chased by enemy fighters back to the station, where the sentry
    guns destroyed the fighters. Freed of the threat, the pilots were able to return
    to the battle and aid in the continuing efforts. \n\nWith support ships and fighters
    destroyed, the carriers succumbed in quick succession as the remote repairing
    chain was broken link by link."
