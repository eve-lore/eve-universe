    - **** The contentious Military Reforms Act first proposed by the Caldari Providence
    Directorate in April was passed by the Chief Executive Panel today. Despite strong
    objections by Hyasyoda, Nugoeihuvi and Sukuuvestaa, Ishukone and CBD sided with
    the patriot bloc's corporations in passing the measure, which will go into effect
    at the end of the month. Among the provisions of the act are unification of equipment
    specifications and clarification of overall chains of command, both of which will
    be brought in line with Navy standards.\n\n\"Corporate autonomy, while important,
    cannot trump the good of the State and the safety of its citizens,\" said Sishanuta
    Murae, a member of the Ishukone delegation. \"Giving the Navy control over logistics
    and communications will go a long way toward preventing needless disruptions to
    interstellar commerce, not to mention civilian deaths like those in Uphallant
    and elsewhere.\" CBD did not give any reason for its change of heart, but Panel
    insiders say the corporation was concerned for the security of its trade shipments
    in the border zone and wanted to distance itself from Nugoeihuvi.\n\n\"This is
    a dangerous step in restricting corporate security's ability to guard vital assets
    and privileged corporate information,\" Sukuuvestaa delegate Iidastoh Vapalmaa
    told the media after the vote. \"Shared lines of communication are much harder
    to secure and the new arrangement endangers both property and employees. If it
    is necessary to submit to these rules when operating in these territories, our
    corporation will certainly be scaling back its previous plans to invest there.\""
