- body: "Nakugard \u2013 Kammas Grayli, the prime suspect for the Krusual arms factory
    bombings in Nakugard has been found dead in what investigators are describing
    as a 'gruesome murder scene'. Grayli was being held by Republic Customs in connection
    with the Krusual arms complex bombings in Nakugard when he was seized by masked
    paramilitaries. Despite suggestions that the Krusual Tribe may have been involved
    in the kidnap of Grayli, no concrete evidence has been uncovered. Krusual sources
    have vehemently denied the involvement of any tribal authorities in the raid on
    the Customs Service compound.\n\nHowever, the discovery of Grayli's body in a
    rubbish disposal plant aboard the Krusual Tribe Bureau station orbiting Moon 12
    of Nakugard V has reinforced the views of those who believe that the tribe was
    in some way connected with the kidnap and, now, the killing of Grayli. Others
    have pointed out that three of the four stations in the Nakugard system are Krusual
    Tribe installations and the discovery of the body aboard one of them is hardly
    significant.\n\nJomain Ariakor, spokesman for the Republic Justice Department,
    remarked, \"It should surprise no-one that Grayli has been discovered dead, murdered
    in fact, after the talk of vengeance and tribal justice we have heard from the
    Krusual Tribe. It should also be no surprise that his body has been discovered
    in an area of a Krusual-operated station that one would have thought would be
    accessible by relatively few people.\"\n\nAriakor went on to give details of the
    murder, \"What does surprise, no shock, is the grotesque manner in which this
    man was murdered. While it may disturb many, I feel I must reveal that Grayli
    was garroted after being bound and beaten. The body had a number of outcast tattoos
    carved into it, indicating this was a ritual vengeance killing. This disgusting
    murder was no semblance of justice. It was, quite simply, a vile act of hateful
    revenge. Moreover, the man may well have been innocent of the Nakugard bombings.
    Without the opportunity of a just trial, we shall never know for sure.\"\n\nSpeaking
    in his own capacity, Tobias Efrit, the noted Krusual parliamentarian, said, \"It
    really makes me laugh when petty officials such as Ariakor try to divine some
    great significance from the discovery of a body in one of dozens of rubbish disposal
    sections aboard one of three stations owned by the Krusual Tribe in Nakugard.
    I find it ludicrous that this Sebiestor talking-head continues to imply criminal
    acts on the part of our great tribe when it is clear that some over-zealous individuals
    have taken the law into their own hands here. I will agree that it is not for
    us to judge the justice of this outcome. However, I am confident that the Krusual
    Tribe will have justice for the vile murder of almost a hundred of our kin, if
    it is not the case that we have already.\"\n\nWith the death of Grayli, it is
    uncertain in what direction the investigation into the sabotage of the Krusual
    arms factories will now go. Privately, the investigation team believes they had
    the right man or at least that Grayli had key information necessary to progress
    the case. The Ammatar connection remains in the minds of many and these events
    will no doubt add to tensions along the disputed border."
