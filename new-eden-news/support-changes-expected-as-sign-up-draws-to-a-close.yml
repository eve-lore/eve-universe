- body: "The candidates for the post of the president of the Gallente Federation are
    ready to start their hunt for emissaries in earnest. Naturally, all of them want
    only the very best to act as their emissaries, which prompted them to seek the
    support of the energetic corporations of the pilot community. The move has met
    with great success for all the candidates, with dozens of corporations already
    having declared their support.   \n  \nNow the corporation sign-up phase is drawing
    to a close, but in the final stretches, participating corporations will be allowed
    to change their allegiance, in the truest of democratic manner. Corporations are
    also allowed to alter what region they want to participate in. As the regions
    hold different amount of electoral votes, choosing the right region compared to
    the relative strength of the pilot corporation is imperative.   \n  \nOnce the
    sign-up phase ends, the competition itself will begin: collecting vouchers for
    the chosen candidate. More news will be posted when the sign-up phase is about
    to end."
