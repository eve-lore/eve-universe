    SAFIZON - The Imperial flagship  _TES  Auctoritas _ was sighted in the Norgoh
    constellation of Domain today, accompanied by a flotilla of escort vessels as
    she traveled across the Throne Worlds toward Ebidan, where it is rumored the flight
    trials of the most recent addition to the Amarr Navy are due to begin this week.


    _Auctoritas  _was announced as the new Ceremonial Imperial Flagship and officially
    named by Empress Jamyl Sarum I on July 20th, when she visited Amarr Navy Headquarters
    in Safizon to inspect the Royal Shipyards during the vessel''s initial construction.


    Billed as the "most technologically advanced vessel in the Imperial Fleet", details
    of her capability have remained under close guard given the fact that the Empress
    herself will be her pilot, however The Scope has learned from a number of subsystem
    contractors that she will benefit from the most advanced armor layering technology
    ever fitted to a vessel of Amarr design, as well as new class of Antimatter Reactors
    that are more than 30% more efficient than those fitted to the Amarr Navy''s standard
    Abaddon class.


    The vessel departed Amarr Navy headquarters around four hours ago, with a number
    of military enthusiasts waiting to catch images of her polished, gold plated hull
    as she made her way toward The Throne Worlds.


    It is expected that the vessel will spend up to two weeks in flight trials, testing
    everything from the construction and durability of her chassis, to the performance
    of her weaponry and engineering subsystems before she returns to Safizon for her
    final fitting and formal commissioning.'
