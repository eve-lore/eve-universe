    response to the repositioning of the Leviathan-class titan _Shiigeru_ into low
    orbit of Caldari Prime.\n\nA hail of cynosural distortion caused electromagnetic
    interference severe enough to momentarily crash traffic control and cynosural
    jamming subsystems on board the Luminaire stargate in Algogille, as an uncountable
    number of capital-class vessels departed the system approximately 30 minutes ago.
    \ \n\nIn response, the Caldari Navy successfully jumped four Wyvern-class supercarriers
    across the border during the short window that the cynosural jamming systems were
    disabled in Luminaire. It is reported that the four vessels immediately rendezvoused
    with the _Shiigeru_ in orbit of Caldari Prime on arrival, and are currently providing
    support after contact was reestablished with the surface just moments ago.\n\nAt
    this time there has been no release of information with regards to the destination
    of the Federation Navy task force."
