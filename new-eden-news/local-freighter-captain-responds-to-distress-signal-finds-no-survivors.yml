- body: "Caslemon - Less than an hour ago, an automated distress beacon was broadcast
    in the Caslemon system. Menerus Jasier, a Gallente freighter pilot conducting
    a supply run contract on behalf of FedMart, was the first to respond to the call.
    He discovered a crippled Iteron industrial-class ship, in a scene he described
    as \"disturbing.\"  \n  \n\"It didn't look like it was attacked by another ship,\"
    he stated to local reporters. \"Most of the structure was intact, it was just
    burned out and dead in space. The crew were all dead, too.\"  \n  \nThere are
    further reports that freelance salvagers have already begun picking over the ruined
    ship. Pilots broadcasting over local frequencies claim to have found no cargo
    of value in the ship, nor have they discovered any sign it was loaded at the time
    of the fatal blast. However, shipping and handling authority sources in the Essence
    region record the Iteron as having been leased to the Federation Navy under a
    short-term contract. The ship was reportedly carrying cargo, though no specifics
    were given in public records. The destination is also not on public record and
    the Federation Navy have declined to comment at this time, stating only that they
    will be conducting their own investigation of the incident."
