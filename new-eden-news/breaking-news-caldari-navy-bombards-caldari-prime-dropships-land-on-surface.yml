- body: "Luminaire - The Caldari Navy-led task force that has locked itself inside
    the Luminaire System is reportedly landing \"hundreds of thousands\" of dropships
    onto Caldari Prime following a systematic orbital bombardment of strategic defense
    emplacements all over the planet. The task force has achieved absolute space superiority
    in the system, as all Federation Navy and Customs warships inside the system have
    evidently been neutralized. However, despite its complete vulnerability, Gallente
    Prime is reporting clear space in its vicinity, with absolutely no sign of the
    invaders at this time. \n\nMilitary analysts consulted by Scope News have stated
    that the Caldari Navy appears to have committed \"every resource at their disposal\"
    to this colossal endeavor, and as such has left its rearguard flanks completely
    exposed to Federation counterattack. \n\n_Posted 15:01 GMT_"
