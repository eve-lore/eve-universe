- body: "Earlier this week the Caldari State corporation InoTech Star Drive Solutions
    announced that they had successfully achieved a breakthrough in the advancement
    of interstellar jump drive technology. \n\nDeveloped as a part of the ongoing
    research into the advancement and refinement of interstellar travel, InoTech Star
    Drive Solutions CEO Dr. Inoki Shotsu described the technology as a \"terminal
    point independent jump drive system - or in other words a jump drive that does
    away with the cynosural field generator at the destination\". According to the
    press release, a number of prototype TPI Jump Drives were installed in several
    frigate-sized vessels, which were then successfully jumped to destinations in
    excess of 2 lightyears from their starting point. Dr. Shotsu claimed that there
    remain only a few minor issues with the technology, and maintains that these problems
    will be overcome and the new drives ready for public demonstration within two
    months. \n\nInoTech also announced the commencement of a partnership with the
    capsuleer corporation APEX Unlimited. When asked what this partnership would provide
    with respect to the new drive system, Dr. Shotsu responded: \"APEX has been instrumental
    in working out some of the more troublesome aspects of the technology. Their freedom
    of action has enabled us to cut through the administrative morass and saved us
    months in the pursuit of our goals.\" \n\nAlthough InoTech Star Drive Solutions'
    technological leap is causing much excitement in the scientific community, it
    is the strategic implications of InoTech's claims regarding the new drives capabilities
    that is expected to catch the eye of all the major factions in the EVE cluster.
    With Dr. Shotsu rumoured to have active ties to the Caldari Navy, with whom he
    was employed prior to the founding of InoTech Star Drive Solutions, it is widely
    believed that the Caldari state will be the first to reap the benefits of the
    new technology."
