    Villore - Reaction from federal senators to Mens Reppola''s appointment as Ishukone
    CEO has been limited since its announcement, as the senior legislative body of
    the Gallente Federation continues to adjust to a re-energized Foiritan administration
    in the wake of last year''s events. Taking evidence from analysts at the recent
    Foreign Relations Committee hearings, senators probing the background of the new
    Ishukone CEO were widely observed to word their questions on the topic in what
    many deemed carefully neutral language.


    Suggestions by witnesses that the Reppola appointment is an opportunity for renewed
    diplomatic engagement - a thesis most forcefully advanced by Caille Strategic
    Review editor Dr. Iyrene Cosala - were not followed up, with the committee opting
    instead to concentrate on the implications a revitalized Ishukone could have for
    the Caldari State''s military strength. While its focus rested in large part on
    the military career of the new Ishukone CEO, who is a former captain in the Caldari
    Navy, the committee steered clear of all inflammatory lines of questioning.


    Speaking after her session with the committee, Dr. Cosala expressed frustration
    at the approach taken by the senators: "It is too cautious and shortsighted to
    take an outsider''s view of what it means to have a strong Ishukone under the
    leadership of a military figure. In Caldari terms, Mens Reppola has credibility
    because of his record and thus can effectively oppose the extremes of the Heth
    agenda." The Federation Senate continues to support the Foiritan administration
    on foreign policy and no statement has been issued by the Foreign Relations Committe'
