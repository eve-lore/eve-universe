- body: "CATCH \u2013 The Interstellar Starbase Syndicate has recently celebrated
    its first birthday and as part of the celebrations the ISS has returned to neutral
    standings with all its former enemies. The Interstellar Correspondents spoke with
    ISS Chairman Count TaSessine about the past 12 months and the future of his alliance.
    \n\nLast June ISS began as one of the first neutral entities in this universe.
    Its stated goal was to provide \u201Cgeneral access to 0.0 for as many people
    as possible.\u201D From there, as the number of capsuleers within its ranks increased,
    ISS began a program of deep space development in order to create infrastructure
    in virgin regions of space, which has culminated in the construction of several
    outposts. \n\nCount TaSessine commented on the complexities of ISS neutrality:
    \u201CAlliance politics do not interest us, and we try not to get involved with
    them.\" Count TaSessine went on to explain what political neutrality means to
    the ISS \"we don't get involved in alliance wars. But we are not neutral to the
    degree that we ignore pirates or don't shoot back at them.\" \n\nCount TaSessine
    explained that this neutrality has given the ISS freedom to move towards their
    goals. With thousands of starbases and seven outposts and sixteen hundred members
    ISS has grown far beyond its initial idea. ISS has accomplished this mammoth task
    by engaging the capsuleer community. Shares in the individual outposts were marketed
    to capsuleers in exchange for ISK to help pay for the production of the outposts.
    Furthermore the shares entitle the owner to a percentage of the profit which the
    outpost makes. The first such outpost to be built in this fashion was the ISS
    Marginis. \n\nAs for the future of ISS, Count TaSessine was cryptic but did say
    that for the time being, a period of consolidation would begin to ensure that
    the outposts are producing a good profit for its investors. This is also indicated
    by the first of the birthday celebrations, the reset of standings. By resetting
    negative standings they have increased the possible market for their outposts
    and ensure that capsuleers who may have mistaken ISS as an easy target or not
    accepted their neutrality now have a second chance. \n\nThe ISS has not stopped
    with the standing reset in order to celebrate their birthday; Count TaSessine
    announced a planned \u201COutpost Race\u201D. A race intended for capsuleers to
    test their spirit and setups in a race from the ISS Marginis in KDF-GY to the
    ISS Borealis in P-2TTL. Though details are not yet concrete, Count TaSessine has
    promised a \"huge prize for the winner.\u201D \n\nFinally Count TaSessine wished
    \"to thank the capsuleer community, the investors in our outposts, the traders
    who use them everyday and our friends the pirates who make our lives interesting
    every day.\""
