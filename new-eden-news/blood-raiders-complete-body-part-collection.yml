- body: "Omir Sarikusa, leader of the Blood Raiders, has called a halt to the Jovian
    body part collection he urged his followers upon a few days ago. Despite severe
    competition with other pilots for the spoils, the Blood Raiders have collected
    a sizeable portion of the body of the hapless Misu Baniya. Omir Sarikusa has gathered
    all the parts under his control at his hideout, carefully stored as if for a long
    journey. Intelligence agencies monitoring the Blood Raiders have reported that
    many of Sarikusa\u2019s top lieutenants have assembled in their most powerful
    vessels at the hideout, their cargo holds stuffed full with valuable items.   \n
    \ \nCONCORD estimates that the Blood Raiders lost several hundred vessels over
    the last few days, forcing them now to lay low and lick their wounds. The frenzied
    body part harvesting may be over, with Blood Raider space returning back to normal,
    but something is brewing under the surface for sure. Something worth sacrificing
    hundreds of ships for."
