    Ministry of Internal Order Accuses Angels of Sabotage\n\nA Hedion university research
    facility on Rumida II has been destroyed in a gas explosion. The Ministry of Internal
    Order has declared the explosion an act of sabotage, blaming the Angel Cartel
    for the apparent attack. The location was one of many Hedion University planetside
    facilities working on research and development projects in partnership with the
    Amarr Empire.\n\nAccording to the MIO this was the latest in a series of suspected
    attempts by the Angel Cartel to disrupt Amarr research efforts. Other events cited
    included power blackouts, communication jamming attempts, and missing shipments.
    The MIO has refused to release any specifics on these supposed events. The Ministry
    has also denied independent investigators access to the facility on Rumida II,
    causing concerns over the validity of their claims.\n\nThe Ministry of Internal
    Order has been quick to act, conducting a number of raids on suspected Angel Cartel
    hideouts. According to the Ministry, there have been two hundred and seventeen
    \u201Cconfirmed executions\u201D but no arrests. Criminology experts have estimated
    that this would represent a tiny fraction of Angel operatives within the Empire.
    Amarr security forces have reported a rise in violent crimes associated with the
    Cartel, implying that the Angels may have been emboldened by the Ministry\u2019s
    attempted crackdown.\n\nWhile the MIO refused to comment on the nature of the
    research being disrupted, it is widely known that the Amarr and the Angel Cartel
    are in fierce competition for fifth place in the ongoing \u201CRace for the Hives.\u201D
    This is the ongoing competition to develop technology that will allow the occupation
    of Drifter wormhole systems. With only five Drifter Wormholes available, only
    the leading five factions will be successful.\n\nResearch teams in the Caldari
    State\u2019s School of Applied Knowledge have reported that they are merely days
    away from making a final breakthrough in the development of Drifter Wormhole access
    technologies. As the competition enters its final stretch, it will be the actions
    of capsuleers that decides who gains access to this new frontier and leads the
    war against the Drifter menace.\n\n### Race for the Hives Results in Full\n![Faction
    Progress 28-03](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/4rItqh0pjKggqzxRAk5CX9/24c1c35e23d4b69b1687e0146f39471b/RacePenult.png)\nThis
    graph, and the information below, show each participating faction's share of the
    total contributions received up to this point:\n\n- Triglavian - 26.4% (down 2.7%)\n-
    Caldari - 14.2% (down 0.6%)\n- Minmatar - 13.0 (down 1.3%)\n- EDENCOM - 10.7%
    (up 1.1%)\n- Angels - 9.9% (up 0.4%)\n- Amarr - 9.6% (up 2.4%)\n- Gallente - 5.6%
    (down 0.4%)\n- SOCT - 3.9% (up 0.3%)\n- Upwell - 3.7% (up 0.2%)\n- EverMore\t-
    3.0% (down 0.4%)\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe top positions remain steady despite shrinking
    gaps across the board. The Triglavians have safely secured first place, and the
    Caldari State have edged further ahead of the Minmatar, who still hold a secure
    third place. EDENCOM are similarly confident of success in fourth place, and have
    already begun to widen their recruitment base in anticipation of the coming change.\n\nMost
    attention is being given to the battle for the final slot, with the Amarr creeping
    up on the Angels. The Empire and the criminal Cartel are neck to neck, and though
    the Angels still retain a slim lead, they will need to keep up their efforts as
    the Amarr advance.\n\nThe Gallente remain squarely in seventh place, the furthest
    back of any of New Eden\u2019s major nations. The failure to inspire a competitive
    research program or gather dedicated capsuleer support has led President Celes
    Aguard\u2019s political opponents to criticize her leadership. "
