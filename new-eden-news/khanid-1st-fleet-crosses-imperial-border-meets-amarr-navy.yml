- body: 'Moments ago, the Khanid Royal 1st Fleet crossed into the Tash-Murkon Region
    of the Amarr Empire. The Fleet was immediately met by the Amarr Navy. The Amarr
    Navy ships took up escort positions around the Khanid 1st Fleet and the two fleets
    tandem warped away. Current reports have the two fleets traveling toward Tash-Murkon
    Prime.


    The presence of the Khanid 1st Fleet in Imperial space marks the first time Khanid
    warships have entered Imperial sovereign territory in centuries. Neither the Amarr
    Empire nor the Khanid Kingdom had any comment to make regarding the unprecedented
    border-crossing.


    The 1st Fleet is the traditional honor guard of King Khanid II. Since it normally
    leaves Khanid Prime only when King Khanid II does so - a scenario that has become
    increasingly rare in recent centuries - the 1st Fleet is today a largely ceremonial
    posting.'
