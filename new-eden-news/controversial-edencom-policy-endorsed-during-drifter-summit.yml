    Faction Delegates Convene\n\nA think tank held as part of a \u201CDrifter Summit\u201D
    in Jita 4-4 has endorsed a controversial future direction put forward by EDENCOM
    delegates. Organized by the Sisters of EVE and facilitated by the Arataka Research
    Consortium, the summit was held inside Jita 4-4 on YC127-05-01.\n\nDelegates from
    all five Drifter wormhole-occupying factions met to discuss issues pertaining
    to the ongoing war with the Drifters. Aiming to garner wider support from those
    assembled in the hopes of influencing future policies, Capsuleer representatives
    from the Amarr Empire, Caldari State, EDENCOM, Minmatar Republic, and Triglavian
    Collective gathered. The Triglavians themselves could not be invited to attend
    due to the ongoing conflict in Pochven, and instead, a group of Kybernauts joined
    on their behalf.\n\nThree topics were opened up to discussion: research sharing,
    the Drifter hyperspace network, and the continued military response to the Drifters.
    \ All those present agreed that a policy of aggressive experimentation programs
    is the best approach to the hyperspace network, and that military resources should
    be dedicated to the continued assault on remaining Drifter forces.\n\n![DSallProposals](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/4yxJpVC2uB8F0lwkiJNAdM/043fd82c2605a89b4abfe9b3f581f591/DSallProposals.png)\n\nControversy
    broke out over the first topic of how to manage the sharing of research gathered
    from the Drifter wormhole systems. The Amarr, Caldari, and Triglavians agreed
    that a joint research program between those that had claimed a wormhole would
    be the best path forwards. Minmatar and EDENCOM representatives instead suggested
    that more open policies that were inclusive of outsider factions would be the
    best route forwards.\n\nThe gallery members agreed to support both Minmatar and
    EDENCOM, ultimately choosing EDENCOM to lead the proposal. EDENCOM's victory was
    by a narrow margin after a preferential voting runoff.\n\n![adoptedDSproposal](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/N87XtVsAKpc4gfVJjCdg2/c388f9a0945a81be46bb288de481ea8b/adoptedDSproposal.png)\n\nProvost
    Marshall was approached to comment on the result and described it as \u201Can
    interesting discussion.\u201D \u201CEDENCOM is and always has been focused on
    the defense of our cluster,\u201D she stated. \u201CThe knowledge we gain from
    investigations into the Sentinel MZ will be used to that end. How best we achieve
    that, and who should participate in that endeavor, is something we will be considering
    with great care.\u201D\n\nWhile positions taken by representatives were advisory
    in nature and not binding for faction leadership, they have garnered wider criticism
    from many politically-minded capsuleers. Rumors of the summit sparked strong responses
    from capsuleers concerned that their own factions would be swayed by the arguments
    of the EDENCOM and Minmatar loyalists. Additional unverified rumors are circulating
    of possible attempts to block these groups' progress inside Barbican and Sentinel,
    allowing them to fall to the Drifters rather than risking Drifter technology being
    made available outside the five occupying factions. When asked what she thought
    of these rumors, Provost responded, \u201CAnyone who would disrupt our attempts
    to further their own agenda is not doing harm to EDENCOM, they are putting at
    risk the fate of the whole cluster. We must crush the enemy on every front or
    else their tyrannical vision of our annihilation will forever remain a threat.
    The petty pleas of nationalists and the threats of Triglavian sympathizers only
    serve to play into the hands of the Drifters.\u201D\n\nThe true impact of the
    adopted proposal on New Eden will only become clear with time.\n\n### Notable
