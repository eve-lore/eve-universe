- body: 'Pator - Officials from both the Minmatar government and the Gallente entertainment
    corporation Impetus yesterday announced that the two sides had reached an agreement
    for the rebroadcast rights of the Sanmatar inauguration ceremony. Impetus also
    announced that negotiations for exclusive rights to future events were in their
    final stages.


    "Impetus has a long history of production, marketing, and distribution," said
    Stalm Corinder, speaking on behalf of the Minmatar government. "Their expertise
    and experience will allow all people -- not just Minmatar -- to relive this historic
    event through their high-quality recordings."


    Not all Minmatar citizens agree with the decision. Many have expressed concern
    that their government made a deal with a Gallente corporation instead of utilizing
    resources from within the Minmatar Republic. "There are plenty of broadcast resources
    in the Republic," one concerned citizen said. "They may not be as large or as
    famous as Impetus, but they''re Minmatar, and that''s what matters."'
