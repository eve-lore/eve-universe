    Caldari State Takes Control of Syndicate Constellation\n\nUM-Q7F, Syndicate \u2013
    Caldari State forces have taken full control of the constellation of DS-M4Q according
    to reports from the Syndicate region. The dramatic move appears confirmed and
    with the apparent agreement of the Intaki Syndicate, following an emergency update
    to the CONCORD Assembly's register of sovereignty at the request of the Intaki
    Syndicate's ambassador to CONCORD.\n\nCaldari Navy units have established significant
    bridgeheads in the DS-M4Q constellation, and have begun rapid construction of
    new infrastructure, apparently including a number of stations in systems such
    as UM-Q7F and 0EK-NJ. Unconfirmed reports indicate that the Intaki Syndicate permitted
    some limited construction ahead of the occupation force, seemingly preparatory
    to the Caldari move. Executive General Heika Torigo has been given command authority
    over the force establishing Caldari presence, building on her experience with
    the successful Serthoulde Campaign in Placid.\n\nChairman Akimaka Saraki has addressed
    the Caldari State: \"Caldari Navy forces executed this operation with the full
    co-operation of the Intaki Syndicate. On behalf of the Chief Executive Panel,
    I have signed a treaty of protection with the Intaki Syndicate, as negotiated
    with the wise partnership of Governor Silphy en Diabel of Poitot. The Caldari
    State undertakes to secure the ongoing independence of the Station Owners and
    System Governors of the Intaki Syndicate, in return for which we have been granted
    colonial rights in systems of the DS-M4Q constellation.\"\n\nAlthough seemingly
    taken by surprise by the Federation Navy's invasion and liberation of Intaki and
    ten other Placid systems, the Caldari State has shown itself able to craft a swift
    and equally surprising response by taking advantage of the Syndicate's clear belief
    that it is under imminent threat from the Federation. The State's new protectorate
    constellation gives it a foothold in a nullsec region close by the Placid region
    it has for so long contested for control with the Federation.\n\nFederation authorities
    appear to be calm in response to this surprise move by the State and have so far
    kept to the long-established line that the \"internal politics and security of
    the Syndicate region is a matter for the Intaki Syndicate.\" A flurry of diplomatic
    activity before the State's forces moved into DS-M4Q has some observers speculating
    that the Federation has declined to dispute the move to avoid an escalation to
    direct confrontation with the large Caldari expeditionary fleet assembled in Samanuni."
