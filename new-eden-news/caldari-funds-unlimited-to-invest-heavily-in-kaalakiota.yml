    Funds Unlimited) and [Kaalakiota Corporation](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Kaalakiota
    Corporation) have issued a joint release announcing a massive investment into
    the megacorp from CFU. The investment will result in CFU taking a 20% stake in
    the megacorp, with the option for KK to buy back 2.5% of the stake each economic
    quarter.


    The investment package is expected to allow Kaalakiota to be much more aggressive
    in its business transactions. The influx of capital is significant, according
    to analysts, because it will allow Kaalakiota to quickly recoup much of what it
    loss in mass sell-offs earlier in the year when it was forced to make debt payments.
    While it is not expected Kaalakiota will attempt to repurchase many of the assets
    it sold directly, it is thought the corporation will target properties that will
    allow it to reenter growing markets.


    By purchasing part of Kaalakiota instead of issuing a loan, Caldari Funds Unlimited
    is showing confidence in interim CEO [Haatakan Oiritsuu''s](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Haatakan
    Oiritsuu) business plan. Should Kaalakiota regain its profitable status, CFU will
    make tremendous profit when KK buys back the stock. However, should Oiritsuu''s
    leadership fail, CFU will stand to lose out and be left with devalued assets.'
