- body: "GENESIS. DED officials are \u201Cconsidering different courses of action
    against the Finite Horizon corporation\u201D due to their increasing drug-related
    activities.   \n  \nIpeman Psarana, Security Officer at DED Yulai X confirmed
    this morning that FZN operatives have been under surveillance, \u201Cin particular
    their recent war against the Coreli Corporation and their war bounty of several
    thousands of m3 of narcotics\u201D.   \n  \nIt had been previously suggested that
    DED attention was due to complaints filed by the Walkai Terraforming Industries
    corporation after their terraforming convoy was neutralized in early June, and
    by the Amarrian Empire after FZN and DNA operatives disrupted an Amarrian Navy
    convoy in Haras two weeks later; both were denied by S.O. Psarana.   \n  \n\u201CIn
    case of property destruction, under the Yulai Convention framework CONCORD vessels
    are allowed to use force only inside high security systems and only immediately
    following said destruction; other than restricting the entrance of dangerous elements
    to high security space CONCORD cannot preemptively engage individuals or corporations
    in any way.\u201D   \n  \n\u201CThe traffic of narcotics, on the other hand, is
    regarded as a dire threat by all Convention signing parties, and as such DED is
    authorized to actively pursue offenders outside normally CONCORD patrolled areas
    and use force if deemed necessary\u201D   \n  \nS.O. Psanara also denied DED\u2019s
    actions in this matter being coordinated by Sark Martek, chief of the joint task
    force created by the Gallente Federation and the Minmatar Republic to fight smuggling
    in general. \u201CSmall fishes are taken care by national customs on a daily basis
    and are not on DED\u2019s priority list. On the contrary, FZN operatives have
    earned themselves a bit of our attention\u201D.   \n  \nPsanara refused to comment
    in detail DED\u2019s actions on this matter."
