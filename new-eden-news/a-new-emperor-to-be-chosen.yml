- body: "Speculations have run rampant among political analysts as to who among the
    Amarr Heirs will become the next Amarran Emperor. As one analyst states: \"The
    Heirs are not just fighting for political power, but also for their own lives...\"
    Our readers are to be reminded of the events leading up to the secession of the
    Khanid region from the Amarr Empire, caused by one Heir's refusal to commit formal
    suicide upon the selection of Emperor Heidieran VII. \n\nAmarr Government Officials
    have declared an official mourning week throughout the Empire. While certain factions
    within the Amarr Empire seem to be heeding Emperor Heidieran VII's last wishes
    by attempting to curry peace, other elements of the Amarr Empire seem poised upon
    a darker path. Like a storm on the horizon, rumors of atrocities and massacres
    have been filtering out of the affected areas. Only time will tell how this shall
    affect the elaborate Succession Rituals."
