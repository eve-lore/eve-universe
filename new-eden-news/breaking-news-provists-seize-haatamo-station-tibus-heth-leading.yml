    resistance. At that time, the Provists attacked the workers causing a panic, though
    no one was sure if there were any casualties. \n\nAccording to the escaped workers,
    the group is heavily armed, have completely sealed off several decks and hangars
    of the station, and are in possession of numerous warships. The [Caldari Navy](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari
    Navy) has scrambled forces to contain the situation."
