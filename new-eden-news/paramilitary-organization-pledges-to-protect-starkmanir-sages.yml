    group calling themselves the Starkman Milisi announced earlier today that they
    intend to provide free security for those Starkmanir sages who request it. This
    comes in response to the recent killing of Sage Uldas Dreeter in Abudban at the
    hands of Minmatar opposing the Amarr faith.\n\n\"We may be the child brother of
    the Tribes, and people in our tribe may have beliefs that some find strange, but
    that does not mean we have to turn the other cheek. We have little in the way
    of culture, but we do have a way of life worth protecting, a way of life worth
    dying for,\" said Milisi spokesman Jeoran Setul in the announcement. \"Some of
    our tribe have decided to keep their beliefs despite living in an environment
    hostile to those beliefs, and we admire them for it and stand by their side, because
    they are our brothers. We are the Minmatar, we are the Tribe, and we are the Republic.
    Those who attack us are enemies of everything we are.\"\n\nSoger Neyd, representing
    the security forces of the Servant Sisters of EVE's refugee camps in the region,
    spoke in support of the Milisi. \"Though I fear this can lead to further escalation
    if left unchecked, I absolutely applaud this effort to protect the freedoms of
    a relatively small religious group.\"\n\nThe Milisi has received statements of
    support from other Tribes in the Republic, especially the Brutor Tribe which has
    pledged to actively support the Milisi efforts with hardware and training. The
    Starkman Milisi consists mainly of ethnic Starkmanir who served in the Tribe's
    various regional militias and police forces during their life in the Ammatar Mandate,
    and claims modern military training over the past two years."
