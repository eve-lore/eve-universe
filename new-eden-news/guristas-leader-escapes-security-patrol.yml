- body: "Late last Monday afternoon a security detachment from the Taladigi Transport
    & Trading Company tracked down and engaged a prominent Guristas pirate leader,
    in response to recent attacks on their shipping. \n\nFollowing the loss of a large
    convoy, which was a major part of a Caldari Navy contract, the previous week TT&T;
    has made numerous attempts to fulfil the contract using much smaller and faster
    cargo shipments. However, despite their best efforts, over the course of the week
    the majority of the vessels and escorts moving the cargo to the destination have
    been destroyed. Unable to withstand any further material loss, and with the looming
    threat of a contract termination from the Caldari Navy, TT&T; security officers
    attempted a new strategy in their efforts to rid themselves of the Guristas menace.
    \n\nContacting local pod pilots, TT&T; security chief Kilroy Eckheart requested
    assistance in tracking down the location of the pirate leader, Gulwort Hilack,
    who had allegedly been drawn to the area by deliberately leaked information concerning
    the departure of an extremely valuable convoy. His call was answered by a several
    capsuleers who began a system by system search of the area Hilack was last seen
    in, quickly finding the Guristas commander and his wingman in the Korama system.
    A small fleet of TT&T; security vessels, led personally by Eckheart, entered the
    system shortly thereafter. \n\nThe TT&T; task force quickly engaged the two pirates,
    but were unable to lock them down before they warped to another point in the system.
    This game of cat and mouse continued for over 90 minutes, as the Guristas ships
    slowly picked off the more vulnerable members of the TT&T; force, including the
    ship and pod of Eckhearts close friend Maxin Haliday. Eventually, the pirates
    made a run for the gate, breaking through the few blockading vessels left after
    the majority of them had been drawn into the pursuit. Analysis of communication
    intercepts has indicated that a third Guristas vessel, presumably a Buzzard-class
    covert ops frigate, was also in the system, feeding Hilack the information that
    allowed him to successfully destroy and evade the vessels in pursuit. \n\nSources
    within the Caldari Navy have stated that, due to this failure from TT&T; to secure
    their own shipping, their contract with the corporation has been terminated. Although
    this cancellation is now likely to mean the Guristas will move on to other areas,
    freeing TT&T; from the responsibility of eliminating the threat, Kilroy Eckheart
    was reportedly \u201Clivid with rage\u201D over his defeat in the field. This
    and the alleged murder of TT&T; hangar worker Narga Forbs, an employee with full
    access to the shipping schedules, just days later indicates that the matter is
    far from closed."
