- body: "Several buy orders for large quantities of contraband goods have been reported
    to have appeared on market terminals around stations in the Placid region this
    evening.   \n  \nThe buyer, identified as one Jevako Niedboux is said to be offering
    considerable amounts of ISK for large quantities of small arms and Caldari officer
    insignias.   \n  \nWhile these goods remain legal within Gallente space, their
    illegality in other regions and the sheer volume requested has sparked substantial
    interest and speculation regarding the motivations behind these unusual orders.
    \  \n  \nNiedboux, described as a small time Gallente trader and CEO of local
    haulage corporation Niedboux Shipping and Handling is reported to deal in all
    manner of items and often works as a middle man in procuring items for individuals
    who value their anonymity.   \n  \nOne local merchant suggested that it was unusual
    for Niedboux to take on such a large order and did not rule out the possibility
    of outside funding.   \n  \nConcord is thought to be currently investigating Jevako
    Niedboux on unrelated allegations of smuggling and people trafficking, though
    no official was available to confirm or deny these rumours."
