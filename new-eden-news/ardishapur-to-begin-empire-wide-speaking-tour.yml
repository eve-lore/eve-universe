    Family announced that Yonis Ardishapur will tour the Empire over the coming weeks.
    The royal heir, whose recent success within the Ammatar Mandate has led to high
    popularity in that domain, is planning on speaking engagements in a variety of
    venues and locations.\n\nComing on the heels of his actions following the terrorist
    bombing that claimed the life of High Deacon Mervan Moritok, the heir expressed
    a desire to \"connect with the true people of Amarr and revitalize their faith
    and loyalty.\" After discussion with his advisers, it was decided that the speaking
    tour will allow the Heir to reach the broadest audience.\n\nOver thirty dates
    have already been announced, with Ardishapur making up to three appearances on
    the same day in some cases. Demand is likely to be high, as admission is to be
    free of charge.\n\nThe heir has dismissed worries that the extensive tour will
    affect his governance of House Ardishapur's domains, including the extensive Ammatar
    Mandate. \"I have many capable administrators and governors ruling the family
    lands. [Heir-Designate] Arim Ardishapur will be overseeing things in my stead.\""
