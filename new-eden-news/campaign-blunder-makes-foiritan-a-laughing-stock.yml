- body: "While Eman Autrech and Mentas Blaque launched their election campaigns with
    only the minimal of hitches, current president Souro Foiritan was left sitting
    in the dust looking like a fool. Foiritan has never been known to be the most
    prepared or meticulous of men, but even his blas\xE9 reputation can\u2019t save
    him some blushes now. While the thoroughly trained delegates of Autrech and Blaque
    are busy stoking the campaign fires of their respective masters, Foiritan\u2019s
    supporters have nothing but pitiful embers to spit at. \n\nSoon after it became
    evident that Foiritan\u2019s delegates were woefully unqualified and inexperienced
    the president quickly distanced himself from the whole thing. All he has been
    willing to say on the matter is that it was still early in the race and plenty
    of time to catch up. Even if pilots supporting Autrech and Blaque got a good head
    start on those supporting Foiritan, it is of no consequence as the latter are
    only competing against themselves. \n\nStill, this does not detract from the fact
    that Foiritan\u2019s cause has suffered greatly in the public eye. But only time
    will tell how, or if, this will affect Foiritan\u2019s chances of retaining his
    presidency. In the meantime, those wishing for five more years under Foiritan
    can only hope that the crash-course his delegates just went through suffices to
    keep Foiritan in the race."
