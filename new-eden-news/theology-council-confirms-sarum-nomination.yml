    the Theology Council has announced its acceptance of Chamberlain Hemirin's request
    to declare Jamyl Sarum Empress-elect and hold a coronation ceremony \"as soon
    as is practicable\". \n\nAfter being ensconced in their chambers for nearly a
    day, the Council finally reconvened to announce its support of Hemirin's position.
    Acceding to the other Heirs' requests to be withdrawn from consideration, and
    accepting the legitimacy of Sarum's claim, it acknowledged that as the sole remaining
    candidate the only acceptable course of action was to declare her Empress-elect
    and proceed with the coronation. It declined to pass any comment on the circumstances
    of Sarum's return, stating simply that \"there is no acceptable explanation of
    [her return] available to us at this time\". \n\nWhile Articio Kor-Azor, Catiz
    Tash-Murkon and Uriam Kador fielded questions and commended the Council on \"a
    difficult decision handled expertly\", the Justices of the Council filed out swiftly
    as soon as the announcement was completed, followed shortly after by Yonis Ardishapur,
    who elected to dispense with the customary speech following decisions of such
    magnitude. On being pressed for comment by members of the press, Ardishapur Family
    Chief Co-Ordinator Bedaliba Izon attempted to deflect questions but after further
    consideration and some deliberation agreed to make a short statement. He expressed
    his support of the individual men and women of the Theology Council, declaring
    that they had \"the fortitude to make a very serious decision in an unfavorable
    and highly pressured environment, the wisdom to know which choice would be the
    best one for the ancient and glorious Empire, and the intelligence to make a decision
    following their heads rather than their hearts\", and then swiftly exited the
    hall."
