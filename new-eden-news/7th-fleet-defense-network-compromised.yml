- body: "Sosala - Reports are just filtering in of a large scale fleet assault on
    the Saracens central defense cortex in The Bleak Lands. \n\nThe region was beset
    with numerous small raids prior to the main attack focusing on targets of opportunity
    in what now looks like an attempt to draw away elements of the 7th Fleet, spreading
    their forces out thinly. This was followed by a seemingly large, direct fleet
    assault on the Saracens central defense cortex. \n\nA typical Amarrian central
    defense cortex performs many functions but the primary one is in coordinating
    signal scrambling across regions, effectively masking the presence of Amarr Navy
    facilities from ship scanners. \n\nThe details of the attack are little understood
    at this time, what is certain however is a large number of cynosural field activations
    and a heavy ship count in the system, unconfirmed sightings of several Minmatar
    capital ship wrecks have been reported along with numerous other wrecks believing
    to belong to the Defiants. \n\nWhat is certain however, is that the attack force
    seems to have been successful in their assault and the Amarr Navy central defense
    cortex appears to be non-operational in The Bleak Lands."
