- body: "Following the suicide of Jamyl Sarum at the Imperial inauguration ceremony
    two weeks ago without naming an heir to her seat, House Sarum has floundered in
    an apparent power vacuum, with few official commands issued and day-to-day administration
    seen to by senior councillors. However, reports have recently come in that House
    Sarum have been diverting much of their considerable combat-ready forces and bringing
    them closer to Sarum Prime, consolidating their position in their home system.
    \  \n  \nIndependent sources have confirmed that a sizable portion of the formidable
    Sarum House Fleet have just recently landed at Sarum Prime, joining the numerous
    Sarum vessels already stationed there. Exact numbers are difficult to come by
    at this hour, but the sources confirmed that at the very least, four entire squadrons
    have been dispatched to Sarum Prime over the last forty-eight hours.  \n  \nPerhaps
    in response to this swelling in the Sarum Fleet's presence, the Amarr Navy has
    assigned more ships to routine patrol in Sarum Prime space, sending Concord bureaucrats
    scrambling to change the system\u2019s official security status to accurately
    represent the strength of Navy forces currently stationed there.   \n  \nThe status
    change, which is expected to go through sometime during the next few days, will
    bump Sarum Prime into a new official security category, which means that the system's
    inhabitants will have to adjust to new regulations and stricter security measures
    than before. What effect this will have on the daily running of Sarum Prime remains
    to be seen.  \n  \nNo authorities from House Sarum nor the Amarr Navy could be
    reached for comment on the matter."
