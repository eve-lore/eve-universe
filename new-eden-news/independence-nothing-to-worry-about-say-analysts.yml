- body: "Recent figures compiled by CONCORD statisticians have shown that despite
    the ever-increasing trend towards total capsuleer independence, the four Empires
    will still have a large core of loyal and capable supporters. The reports confirm
    a growing trend of support amongst the space bound class, and points towards an
    increasingly relaxed stance from all factions towards their rising independence.
    \n\nJust one example out of many is Siri Blue, a Gallente who has joined an elite
    group of capsuleers held in the highest possible regard by the Federation. Speaking
    in an interview with the Interstellar Correspondents, she shared her own perspectives
    on the loyalties of a pod pilot and the unique work it brings. \n\n\u201CWhile
    the Caldari claim to be the hardest working race in Eve, I dare to say otherwise,\u201D
    she stated wryly, \u201Cit's a lot of hard work.\u201D Speaking about the process
    of winning the trust of the Empire corporations, she stated: \u201CI started my
    career off in the Federation Navy and slowly worked up the ranks. After an uncountable
    number of missions, skirmishes and engagements with pirate gangs and rogue Caldari
    fleets, I managed to gain enough reputation and money to move somewhat higher
    in the hierarchy.\u201D\n\nSince that time, Ms. Blue has worked for other Gallente
    corporations, including the Federal Intelligence Office and Duvolle Laboratories,
    the latter of which she has most recently pledged a stronger loyalty to, as CEO
    of the corporation Blue Division, a capsuleer-based subsidiary. She has also spent
    time working for the longstanding pro-Federation faction, the Servant Sisters
    of Eve. \n\nMs. Blue represents just one of many thousands of loyal capsuleers,
    who typically spend a large majority, if not all their time serving Faction's
    corporations. Analysts involved in the report stated that the entities had little
    to worry about, despite the increasing amount of capsuleers going completely independent:
    \u201CAs long as the current concomitant rise in Empire-based capsuleers continues,
    then the needs of the Empires that spawned them will continue to be met as well.\u201D\n\nMs.
    Blue herself stated that in fact, she felt a distinct lack of high-level work
    at times, reflecting a broader desire amongst the upper crust of the capsuleer
    elite for new challenges and responsibilities. \u201CIf there was the opportunity
    to prove my value to the Federation, I\u2019d try my best that very moment\u2026although
    the Federation is a rather peaceful place...it\u2019s hard to find real challenges.
    I feel that the Federation Navy should start opening up the\u2026ranks for their
    capsuleer pilots, it is obvious that [we] can achieve far more than normally crewed
    ships. Not using the abilities of their capsuleer agents to their full extent
    is a waste of resources and will possibly be a grave mistake should it come to
    a new war with the Caldari State.\u201D\n\nWhether or not the Empires eventually
    follow the advice of Ms. Blue and others like her remains to be seen. What is
    certain however is that in the meantime, they will still have plenty of work for
    freelance capsuleers, loyal combatants and traders alike, and will seek to further
    extend their influence over the capsuleer class as more and more pilots graduate."
