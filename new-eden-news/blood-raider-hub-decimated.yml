- body: "BLEAK LANDS. The Blood Raider hub decimated by Amarrian loyalist forces last
    Sunday has been described by a Cult of Catechization High Priest as being \"just
    a leftover of their Bleak Lands forces.\" \n\nAccording to High Priest Delsiah
    of the Cult of Catechization \u2013 who was responsible for the operation \u2013
    the hub\u2019s Blood Raider personnel had remained in the region and strangely
    \"did not leave in their exodus last year.\" \n\nThe Amarrian loyalist forces,
    lead by a Cult of Catechization fleet and supported by several Amarrian paramilitary
    pod-pilot organizations such as Aegis Militia and SHOD among others, proceeded
    from the Myyhera system to Haras' tenth planet to \"cleanse a Blood Raider pit
    that our scouts had reported earlier,\" as explained by High Priest Delsiah. \"In
    His infinite mercy, it pleased God to let our lasers remove the heretic scum with
    ease, and make their death swift.\" \n\nWhen asked on whether or not this newly
    discovered hub could be a spear head in a Blood Raider effort to reclaim their
    former territories in the Bleak Lands, or even a staging point for an attack similar
    to the Mabnen I disaster. High Priest Delsiah said that \"all our intelligence
    shows that this was just a remaining tumour of a foul infestation that shall never
    taint Amarrian lands again; our Emperor's subjects can sleep tight knowing our
    Empire's borders are well guarded.\" \n\nHowever, according to High Priest Delsiah
    the Cult of Catechization believes that \"other remaining tumours may still exist,\"
    and further scout and cleansing missions may be required in the near future; explaining
    that \"after we finish analyzing the evidence gathered in this operation, we will
    know better what next steps should be taken.\" \n\nThe Blood Raider hub was comprised
    of a Chapel and some 50 vessels, according to figures released by the Cult of
    Catechization and later confirmed by CONCORD reports."
