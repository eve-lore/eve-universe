- body: "With the recent inter-Empire conflicts, reports of widespread banditry and
    raiding have come flooding in. While exact figures are not published by CONCORD,
    the total number of ship-kills is expected to increase for the sixth straight
    month. Sales figures from the major ship-building cartels have also been on the
    rise, indicating a healthy market for replacement ships. \n\nWhile the Empires
    of EVE have not broken out in open warfare, all indications point towards increasing
    political turmoil ahead. As recently reported, even the outlying regional polities
    are affected with the withdrawal of Evolution from the Fountain Alliance. As one
    CONCORD official stated, \"These are troubled times, and all pilots should be
    aware of the dangers of solo travel. Whenever possible, travel in groups of ships
    offering mutual protection. This is especially important when traversing the 0.0
    SecStatus systems in the Outer Regions.\""
