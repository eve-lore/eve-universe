- body: The Gallentean Supreme Court today sent a clear message to the Senate when
    it made a ruling on the high profile case of Trakhan Rislander, a Gallentean citizen
    of Minmatar origin. Rislander had sued the University of Caille when his application
    was turned down, and the Supreme Court has now ruled that UC was wrong in doing
    this under the old minority laws, dating since the Minmatar Rebellion when millions
    of Minmatars poured into the Federation in search of better life. This is the
    first time that the Supreme Court has had to rule on these laws and this should
    rejuvenate them, as they've been more or less ignored in recent years. Rislander
    has released a statement expressing his delight at the ruling, which emphasizes
    the need for positive discrimination to give underprivileged minority groups the
    same opportunities as others. However, a spokesman for the Senate has expressed
    his disappointment over the decision, stating that this will cost the Federation
    billions and only act to further antagonize the relations between the Gallentean
    majority and the minority groups.
