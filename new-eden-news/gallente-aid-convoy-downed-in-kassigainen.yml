- body: "A Gallente Federation aid convoy was shot down in the Kassigainen system
    yesterday evening by a contingent of capsuleer forces from the Veto corporation.
    The convoy was carrying food and medical supplies bound for Truiisu Station, a
    Kaalakiota Corporation-owned mining colony on Kassigainen IV that has over the
    past two days been the site of fierce rioting.   \n  \nThe sudden attack came
    in the wake of a 30-minute long standoff between the captain of the convoy and
    forces from the Home Guard, Kaalakiota\u2019s police force, who had refused to
    permit the convoy access to its final destination.   \n  \nAccording to witness
    accounts, Home Guard forces had repeatedly told the convoy that no official request
    for aid had been made and that they did not possess the necessary clearance to
    enter the Kassigainen IV airspace.   \n  \nThe convoy\u2019s captain, Commander
    Dirai Guvera, had countered by stating the convoy was there in the name of the
    Gallente President as a gesture of friendship and goodwill, carrying only food
    and medical supplies.   \n  \nMatters were not helped when one of the Home Guard
    ships scanned the convoy\u2019s Obelisk-class freighter, finding a 500-troop supplement
    of Federation Navy marines. It was shortly after this that the Veto force attacked,
    destroying every ship in the Federation convoy while suffering significant losses
    themselves. The Home Guard forces did not intervene.   \n  \nWhile the motivations
    for the attack are unclear at this point, Ethan Verone, CEO of the Veto corporation,
    in a statement released earlier today on GalNet, claimed that \u201C[Veto] were
    contacted regarding, and subsequently accepted a contract of employment to destroy
    the Federation Navy convoy ... The client wishes to remain fully anonymous.\u201D
    See the full text of the release [ here](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=423153).
    \  \n  \nPresident Foiritan of the Federation this morning released a statement
    wherein he expresses his regret that \u201Can operation intended to save innocent
    lives instead ended up costing even more.\u201D   \n  \n\u201CThe Gallente Federation
    has extended the olive branch, and it has been torn from our hands and burned,\u201D
    the statement said.   \n  \nCaldari authorities have yet to comment on the matter.
    The situation on Truiisu Station remains largely unchanged, with the current death
    toll rumored to stand at approximately four hundred people."
