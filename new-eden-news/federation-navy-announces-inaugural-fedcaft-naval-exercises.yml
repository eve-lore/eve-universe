- body: 'ESSENCE - A combined fleet of Federation Navy, Customs and Tripwire vessels
    were seen departing Navy headquarters in Algogille this evening, shortly after
    an announcement from Admiral Anteson Ranchel declaring the beginning of the inaugural
    "Federal Combined Armed Forces Training" exercises.


    In the press conference approximately an hour ago, Admiral Ranchel indicated that
    "these exercises are designed as a team building experience to strengthen the
    bonds between our armed forces. The goal is to further develop working relationships
    between divisions, in order to continue the enhancement of Federal border security
    after the events of YC110 and the attack in Evaulon last November. We also hope
    that the exercises will assist in further streamlining internal communication
    within the Gallente military."


    Soon after the press conference concluded, a fleet consisting of a pair of Soltueur
    class titans, flanked by four Erebus, eight Nyx class supercarriers and several
    squadrons of Thanatos and Moros class capitals, was seen departing Algogille to
    an undisclosed location somewhere in Placid. In response, the Caldari Navy has
    mobilized a significant portion of its fleet, which appears to be en route to
    the neighboring region of Black Rise in order to reinforce the border.


    Several notable military experts have commented that this may be the explanation
    behind the name "Operation Highlander," which was overheard during a Senate assembly
    on March 13. Both the Federation Navy and Senate remain unwilling to comment on
    the nature of this operation or the violation of the Gallente border by Caldari
    Navy forces on the evening of March 14.'
