- body: 'Amarr - In a historic first, Empress Jamyl I met with King Khanid II in the
    Imperial city of Dam-Torsad today. Flanked by Imperial Paladins, the Empress greeted
    Khanid II and welcomed him back to Amarr Prime.


    Mimicking what transpired several days ago on Tash-Murkon, the Empress swiftly
    retired to private council with Khanid II, where they have remained since. Once
    again, neither side has issued any comment about the meeting.


    The meeting between the two heads of state is historic for several reasons. It
    marks the first face-to-face meeting between Khanid II and an Imperial ruler since
    early in the reign of Doriam II. Additionally, Khanid II has not set foot on Amarr
    Prime since the Kingdom split from the Amarr Empire over 300 years ago.'
