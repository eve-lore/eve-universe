- body: "Yulai, Genesis - Debate in the CONCORD Assembly of a proposed \"New Eden
    Defense Fund\" in a weekend-long special session has been marked by strong support
    for action to bolster New Eden defenses against the Triglavian invasion and other
    threats.\n\nThe New Eden Defense Fund proposals outline an extensive program of
    works to improve planetary and colony defenses, and enhance the defensive and
    offensive capabilities of vital installations. The CONCORD Inner Circle referred
    the defense fund proposals from the DED and AEGIS to the full assembly, with a
    recommendation to set up the fund, but left details of sourcing the necessary
    monies to representatives of all member states.\n\nAEGIS Provost Marshal Kasiha
    Valkanir reiterated in her statements to the Assembly the importance of survival
    technology for military personnel, advocating augmentation and personality backup
    wherever feasible. The DED's Star Marshal Kjersidur Elladall emphasized the importance
    of continuing to support capsuleer efforts through loyalty programs and support
    for accelerated training for those combating threats such as the Triglavians and
    Drifters.\n\nThe Amarr Empire and Gallente Federation have been particularly strong
    supporters of the proposals, with their extensive territories coming under repeated
    attacks by the Triglavians. Though defending more compact empires, the Caldari
    State and Minmatar Republic have also lent support to the measures but criticized
    Amarr and Gallente suggestions that all four empires share the financial burdens
    equally.\n\nThe Assembly is currently in closed session but is reported to be
    \"thrashing out details of a formula that will spread fundraising fairly across
    New Eden's economies.\"\n\n**In Other News**\n\n  * Quafe Corporation Joins Ishukone
