- body: "**YULAI** \u2013 The maverick DED commander who took his fleet into unregulated
    space turned himself in today at an undisclosed location without incident. The
    commander\u2019s name is Tantoseisen Kakkichi, the head of Internal Security at
    the DED. Sources close to CONCORD believe all ships reported missing were accounted
    for, and that all of the officers-- including Kakkichi--were arrested on arrival.
    Some of the returning ships were reported as displaying extensive battle damage.
    \  \n  \nWithin 30 minutes of the arrests, a lawyer by the name of Datannen Fisk,
    claiming to represent the incarcerated commander, released the following statement
    to reporters from the DED headquarters in Yulai:   \n  \n\u201CCommander Tantoseisen
    Kakkichi has formally been charged with conspiracy to commit treason, unlawful
    use of government property, and disobeying a direct order from a superior officer.
    He has asked of me two things. First, he requested that I be his legal counsel
    for these court martial proceedings. I accepted this request unconditionally.
    It will be an honor to represent one of the most distinguished military officers
    in CONCORD, and I will defend Commander Kakkichi as fiercely as I am capable of--that
    is, of course, assuming these same charges against him aren\u2019t dropped once
    CONCORD learns the undeniably justifiable reasons for his bold actions.   \n  \n\u201CThe
    Commander\u2019s second request is that I read to all of you the following statement
    which he prepared himself:   \n  \n\u201CTo the citizens of every sovereignty
    in EVE: Do not make the mistake of questioning the integrity of CONCORD or my
    own personal conviction towards its primary mission. Let me assure you, CONCORD
    is stronger now than it ever was, and while my own actions may seem contradictory
    to that assertion, the truth to these affairs will soon set the record straight.
    As my friend and counsel Datannen is reading this to you, knowledge is being imparted
    to CONCORD that will be of great interest and concern to all of our citizens.
    I imagine it will become publicly available in very short order.   \n  \n\u201CWhat
    you do with this knowledge, as always, is strictly up to you. With it, you will
    be empowered to make decisions for your own well-being, safety, and perhaps even
    prosperity. My mission, and that of the men and women who risked both life and
    career to assist me in this quest, was to bring that knowledge first to CONCORD,
    and then to you. May the powers that be take note of the fact that my actions
    were selfless and intended solely for the greater good of the citizens we are
    sworn to protect. Nevertheless, my crew and I stand ready to accept the consequences
    of our actions, whatever they may be.\u201D   \n  \nCounselor Fisk would not take
    any questions from reporters, and no official statement from CONCORD was made
    available."
