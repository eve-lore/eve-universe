    comes to us from Minmatar space. Saynen Grulliver, a shaman of the Vherokior Tribe
    is reported to be assembling an expedition that shall venture beyond the galactic
    rim towards the object. \"This strange bright star that has appeared in the skies
    of all New Eden is a gateway leading to the spirit world of our ancestors,\" claims
    Grulliver in a rare interview. When pressed about the fact that most scientists
    believe the object is extremely far away, Grulliver merely smiled and said, \"The
    road ahead is long, but we Minmatar have never shirked from an arduous journey.\"
    \n\nReaction from Republic official sources has been dismissive of this enterprise
    stating that there is little scientific fact or accepted spiritual interpretation
    on the matter. A spokesperson for the Republic Parliament had this to say; \"We
    have been made aware of this... expedition that is being assembled and we have
    studied the facts of the matter at hand. It is our strong recommendation that
    citizens should not undertake such a dangerous activity without proper preparation
    and that more careful study and contemplation is required.\" \n\nThere is gathering
    support building for the venture and a significant number of other Minmatar have
    journeyed to join the expedition despite these concerns. It has been noted that
    several of the Republic's more prominently traditionalist Clans have lent their
    support to the expedition and that a solid core of tribal Shamans have begun to
    echo Grulliver's interpretation of the phenomenon. \n\nWhen invited to comment,
    Amarrian clergyman Guril Akkad scoffed at this idea. \"A gateway to the spirit
    lands of his ancestors? A journey beyond the galactic rim? This heathen and all
    who follow him are doomed. Had they simply accepted the word of God which we brought
    to them, then the Minmatar people would now be much better off.\" \n\nSpeculation
    as to the true nature of the shining light in the sky continues unabated, but
    its pulsating beauty will evidently continue to inspire religious figures and
    scientists alike."
