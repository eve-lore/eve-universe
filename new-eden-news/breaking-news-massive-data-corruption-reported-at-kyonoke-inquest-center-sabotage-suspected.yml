- body: 'POSTOUVIN - Additional security forces from the Society of Conscious Thought
    have arrived on scene at the H4-RP4 Kyonoke Inquest Center, after technicians
    reported massive amounts of data corruption earlier this afternoon.


    Details of operations on board have remained incredibly scarce, however the Society
    has confirmed in a statement that a substantial amount of historical data from
    the R4P mining platform has been lost in what is believed to be a targeted digital
    attack.


    The Scope''s SoCT contacts have declined to comment further on the situation as
    a massive data recovery operation has commenced on board the Keepstar class citadel.
    A sizeable manhunt is rumoured to be ongoing on board the Inquest Center, with
    the breach suspected to have been committed locally in order to avoid trace.


    The Scope has also learned of rumors that an unconfirmed number of security staff
    based on the inquest center''s data storage decks which house its datacenters
    have been reported missing.


    With independent capsuleers set to arrive in Postouvin over the course of the
    next 48 hours, round the clock security appears to have been doubled at the Inquest
    Center, with the Federation Navy providing thousands of autonomous enforcement
    drones for regular patrols on board.'
