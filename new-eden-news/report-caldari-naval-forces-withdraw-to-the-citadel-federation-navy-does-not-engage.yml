- body: "Luminaire - Reports are coming in that the Caldari Navy has withdrawn the
    bulk of its forces from Gallente space. The Gallente Navy has refrained from halting
    the withdraw under the orders of President Foiritan. However, Federation Navy
    forces have tailed the Caldari task force back to the border and there have been
    moments where it appeared hostilities would reignite between the two sides. \n\nThe
    Caldari Navy appears to have withdrawn to the Citadel region along the border
    with the Gallente Federation. With the Federation Navy deploying along its own
    border with the State, both Navies remain on high alert. \n\nSurprisingly a Caldari
    Navy force, including a Leviathan-class Titan, remains in orbit around Caldari
    Prime along with weapons platforms and other defensive measures. The Federation
    Navy has managed to clear the mining of the stargates into Luminaire but has purposefully
    kept its distance from Caldari Prime for reasons of its own."
