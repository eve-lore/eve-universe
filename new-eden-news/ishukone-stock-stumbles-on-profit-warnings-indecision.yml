- body: '_Jita - Ishukone announced that first quarter profits this year would be
    less than half what the corporation had predicted at the end of last quarter,
    triggering a sell off today. This punctuates a slight but steady decline that
    has set in over the last few weeks, which many analysts are attributing to the
    still-unresolved CEO issue._


    _" It''s been over two months since we heard rumors that the Ishukone board was
    about to pick Otro Gariushi''s successor," said Asha Inaken, a contributing editor
    at ___The Kimotoro Report__ _. "Yet today, we don''t seem to be any closer to
    a resolution than we were last year. Investors don''t like the uncertainty with
    Ishukone running around headless; any decision would be better than no decision."_


    _So far, Ishukone has declined any further comment on both the profit warnings
    and the CEO decision._'
