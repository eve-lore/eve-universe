- body: "Malkalen, Lonetrek - As the scale of the disaster in Malkalen becomes clear,
    the Servant Sisters of EVE have offered to render aid to the beleaguered local
    Caldari relief agencies. \n\n\"Hospitals all over the Malkalen and the neighboring
    systems are swamped right now, with more injured pouring in as rescue crews push
    their way deeper into the wreckage,\" reported Freda Bismallein, a spokeswoman
    for the Sisters of EVE. \"Given the amount of humanitarian aid that the Sisters
    perform throughout the cluster, we have the skills and experience to be of significant
    help, both to the wounded and to those displaced by the disaster.\" \n\nThis experience
    was ably shown when the Sisters began mobilizing trained rescue and medical crews
    within hours of the incident. Similarly, large stockpiles of medical supplies,
    foodstuffs, and temporary housing shelters were prepped and placed onto transports
    as quickly as possible. \n\nBut a pall of uncertainty and tension still hangs
    over the relief effort. \"Obviously there's a political dimension to this as well,\"
    explains Bismallein. \"Relations between the State and the Federation were strained
    to begin with, and with the questions surrounding events in Malkalen it is critical
    that a neutral, third-party organization like the Sisters of EVE step forward.
    We hope that the Caldari government will accept our offer of aid in the spirit
    it is given.\" \n\nThe first transports carrying medical and rescue personnel
    should begin arriving on scene within the hour."
