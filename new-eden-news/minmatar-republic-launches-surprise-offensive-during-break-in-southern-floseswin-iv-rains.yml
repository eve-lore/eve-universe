- body: "Floseswin, Metropolis - Minmatar forces on Floseswin IV have launched a major
    offensive aimed at removing the Amarr occupation of the large majority of the
    southern continental landmass. CONCORD conflict monitors are reporting Republic
    military formations advancing on multiple fronts towards population centers on
    the southern landmass. Sources within Amarr-held cities are additionally reporting
    widespread incidences of sabotage, public disorder and guerilla warfare.\n\nInitial
    reports indicate that the Amarr occupation forces were surprised by the sudden
    offensive, which comes mere days after the 24th Imperial Crusade regained control
    of the neighboring Aset system, a key location for Amarr supply bases. Analysts
    suggest that the Minmatar forces on Floseswin IV had prepared the offensive for
    the first available break in weather during [the southern rainy season](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/flosewin-iv-occupation-and-inner-circle-peace-summit-dominate-new-year-yc122/).
    The overwhelming dominance of the Tribal Liberation Force and allied capsuleers
    across the Metropolis conflict zone appears to have allowed the Minmatar to move
    large amounts of troops and materiel onto Floseswin while maintaining operational
    secrecy.\n\nObservers also speculate that the Amarr focus on restoring their supply
    bases in Aset, coupled with an assumption that Minmatar command would likewise
    focus on retaking the system, may have lulled the House Sarum-led forces into
    a false sense of security. Amarr forces have also been highly concentrated on
    maintaining security within their zone of occupation as a sustained campaign of
    low-intensity but highly-distributed guerilla warfare has stretched the occupiers
    relatively thinly. Amarr forces are most heavily concentrated behind massive fortifications
    and forcefields protecting the six major cities of the southern continent, the
    primary mining belt facilities, and the two largest seaports.\n\nWhile there has
    been no public comment from Republic Command's Valklear General Kanth Filmir or
    House Sarum's Colonel General Vikhtor Mazari, both sides have been flooding communciations
    frequences and channels across the planet with opposing propaganda, demands for
    surrender, and warnings of retribution. The situation in the major fortified cities
    is unclear but there were scattered reports of explosions and public disorder
    before communications were cutoff by Amarr military authorities. Reports from
    minor cities, towns and villages indicate widespread uprisings against Amarr installations
    and forces spread thinly in the countryside.\n\nAlthough it is impossible to assess
    the outcome of this rapidly developing situation, the early signs indicate a favorable
    military situation for the Republic Command's forces and the Minmatar resistance.
    However, CONCORD monitors have cautioned that the primary fortified Amarr positions
    are highly unlikely to be taken by assault without massive loss of life.\n\n**In
