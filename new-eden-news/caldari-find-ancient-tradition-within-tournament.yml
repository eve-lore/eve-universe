    the study of the Raata Empire believe the incredible popularity of the capsuleer
    tournament traces back to ancient times. The Caldari have always been known for
    their love of competition; be it Mind Clash, Splinterz, or the more hazardous
    activities. Billions of ISK are gambled away on these competitions, yet all of
    that looks as if it may pale in comparison to the upcoming capsuleer tournament.\n\nWhile
    it is not the first of its kind, this year's tournament is the first to be widely
    broadcast within the State. \u201CThe demand for broadcasts of the tournaments
    has been staggering,,\" read a recent statement released by the CEP. \"Everyone
    knows it\u2019s going to be a huge and exciting contest, and they don't want to
    miss any of the action. It would be foolish for us to ignore these requests and
    the business that they will generate.\u201D It is commonly thought that this year's
    tournament\u2019s popularity has grown due to word of mouth, boosted by replays
    of recordings taken from previous competitions and smaller-scale independent capsuleer
    tournaments.\n\nIshkani Muren, professor of Raata culture at the School of Applied
    Knowledge, views the growing popularity of capsuleer events as a revival of the
    Solinit Kuletav, an ancient gladiatorial combat from the early days of the Raata
    Empire. In the ancient competition, warriors would gather from around the land
    to to take part in the Solinit Kuletav and face off against one another with each
    match lasting until one warrior yields or is defeated. Many would compete for
    the prestige, or to redeem themselves in the eyes of their people, others would
    take part for wealth. The rules , to attack an opponent before the start of the
    battle, or after they have yielded, was unacceptable, causing a loss of the match
    and in some severe cases, banishment by their lord.\n\nWhile the Caldari have
    enjoyed countless competitions over the years, professor Muren believes that none
    of these activities have provided the level of violence and danger experienced
    in the Solinit Kuletav. While the capsuleers are at very little risk, thousands
    of crewmen are putting their lives on the line, working to help operate the ship
    in order to claim victory, at the risk of death. To crewmen, this is their chance
    to earn the prestige among their peers, and to the Caldari it is an opportunity
    to view and gamble on a bloodsport unlike any other currently offered."
