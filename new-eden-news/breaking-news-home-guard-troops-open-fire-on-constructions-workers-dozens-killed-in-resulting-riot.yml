- body: "Piak III \u2013 Home Guard troops opened fire and killed at least one Caldari
    Constructions worker at the Armor Forge facility on Piak III, inciting a riot
    that claimed the lives of dozens of employees. Lured outside by Constructions
    CEO Torkebaira Shutsu for alleged negotiations on behalf of the employees trapped
    inside, a Home Guard sniper shot the Constructions worker as he approached the
    executive in the open. Recorded footage depicts a man believed to be Tibus Heth
    braving the gunfire to rescue the fallen comrade as the enraged crowd rushed the
    security perimeter, inciting a stampede that left numerous victims crushed or
    electrocuted. Anonymous sources have provided credible evidence that Kaalakiota
    CEO Haatakan Oiritsuu herself issued the order to use deadly force on the Constructions
    employees to retake the facility; the mega-corporation is furiously denying those
    claims. Tibus Heth, believed to be responsible for leading the revolt, is still
    alive after retreating back into the Armor Forge with the wounded Constructions
    worker slung over his shoulder as Home Guard troops and MTACs faced the rioting
    Constructions workers. Both sides are currently at a standstill; the Armor Forge
    remains under control of Heth and his loyalists. The dropship of Caldari Constructions
    CEO Torkebaira Shutsu was seen departing the Armor Forge just moments ago as Home
    Guard troops secured the perimeter and established triage centers for the wounded.
