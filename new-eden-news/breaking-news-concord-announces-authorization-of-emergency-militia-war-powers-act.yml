- body: "Yulai - The CONCORD Assembly, still reeling from the destruction of its headquarters
    station in Yulai, has announced the immediate authorization of the \"Emergency
    Militia War Powers Act\". This action follows an emergency meeting with all four
    session members, who petitioned for this section of the charter to be ratified
    following the drastic events of the day. Fleet Admiral Kasora Neko is reported
    to have represented the Minmatar Republic. \n\nThe War Powers provision of the
    CONCORD Charter authorizes the \"immediate and unconditional formation of capsuleer
    militias among the nation-state members of the CONCORD Assembly for the purpose
    of waging uncontested war within the boundaries of Empire space.\" According to
    Charter experts, the founders added the emergency provision as a means of absolving
    CONCORD of any obligation to interfere with combat between nation-states, an act
    that protects the DED more than anything else. \n\nThe militias sanctioned by
    the Emergency Militia War Powers Act are: \n\nGallente Federation: Federal Defense
    Union   \nMinmatar Republic: Tribal Liberation Force   \nCaldari State: State
    Protectorate   \nAmarr Empire: 24th Imperial Crusade"
