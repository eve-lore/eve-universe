    stating that just over fifteen thousand slaves from four of the Amarr empire\u2019s
    largest slave colonies would be emancipated and transported to Matar, where they
    will be re-registered as full-standing citizens of the Minmatar Republic.   \n
    \ \nStated Rakman Kasha, spokesman for the Chancellor\u2019s Office, \u201CIn
    the interests of promoting peace between our two nations and mending the rift
    caused by years of violence, our beloved Emperor wishes to extend this gesture
    of goodwill to the Minmatar Republic. Hopefully, in time, our mutual transgressions
    will be sown over with the seeds of peace and understanding.\u201D   \n  \nThe
    fifteen thousand slaves are currently being rounded up and brought to the massive
    transports used for the job. They are expected to land on Houdea, Matar\u2019s
    largest continent, sometime within the next two days.   \n  \nAsked if the mass
    emancipation had any connection to the allegations leveled in recent days that
    PM Karin Midular of the Minmatar Sebiestor tribe had been trading favors with
    the Amarr, Kasha dismissed the question as \u201Cabsolutely ridiculous.\u201D"
