- body: "Last night in the systems of Nonni and Jita, a large scale contraband purchase
    happened for the second time in less than a week.   \n  \nDuring a one hour window,
    when CONCORD and the local police patrols were at a minimum, two freelance traders,
    Kerio Ekoena and Leiara Xjenion announced their presence and began a frenzied
    collection of the illegal goods they required. In this case it was drugs and DNA
    samples.   \n  \nJashira Ne\xB4rgha, the representative for Galactic Trading and
    Logistics was also present. This turnout is leading many to believe that she has
    insider knowledge of when and where these trades are happening. She was however,
    only seen passing through Nonni and it is unclear whether she did participate
    on this occasion.   \n  \nOffical representatives of CONCORD and the police in
    Jita and Nonni, have once again declined to answer any questions about the activities
    in their systems."
