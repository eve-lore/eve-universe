- body: Preliminary investigation into the Roushzar atrocities, where hundreds of
    freed slave children where killed, suggest that a small fanatical Amarrian religious
    cult may be to blame. They have yet refused to comment on the incident, but their
    leadership has suddenly gone into hiding. The cult, called Tetrimon (Divine Devotion),
    has existed for some time now, but this is the first time it has resorted to violence,
    which begs the question where they got their armaments from. The members of the
    cult have scattered to the wind after the attack, some to go into hiding, others
    seeking opportunities for further mayhem. Reliable sources have indicated that
    two priestesses, Hamida Ytheros and Omon Drakian, along with their escorts have
    actually entered Minmatar space and have been spotted in the Angils constellation.
    It is thought that they will be in the Gukarla system, a sacred location in their
    doctrine, at 17:00 GMT for their midday prayers.
