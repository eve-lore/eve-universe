- body: Yulai - Caldari mega-corporation shares across the State have begun to freefall
    following word that Home Guard troops have been deployed to the Constructions
    Armor Forge facility on Piak III. This follows a spate of bad news for the State
    in recent weeks as investors continue to sell off Caldari assets and move to more
    secure investments, in particular Federation securities. Leading analysts are
    calling the situation at Piak "emblematic of the State's broader issues", citing
    the rampant inflation figures for the localized economies under mega-corporation
    control. Shares of Caldari Constructions stock, leading the downward spiral of
    the broader Caldari Funds Index, have already lost more than 30 percent of their
    value in heavy trading.
