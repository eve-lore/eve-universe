- body: "YULAI - SCOPE News has learned that CONCORD is tracking an immense wave of
    superheated plasma currently on a direct collision course with Seyllin I. The
    mass is approaching from the direction of the sun and, according to the officials
    who are aware of its existence, \"moving at several million miles per hour and
    accelerating at an alarming rate.\" SCOPE has also learned that CONCORD and the
    Federation Navy have established a \"zero hour,\" or approximate time for impact,
    and that ships operating in the system are on standing orders to leave the system
    well ahead of this time.  \n  \nEditor's Note: Several reporters were illegally
    detained by CONCORD and the Federation government while bringing you this story,
    myself included. SCOPE has a long-standing tradition of doing what is necessary
    to deliver the truth to our audience; this is precisely the reason why we have
    earned your trust. It is not our place--nor, do we feel, is it anyone else's --
    to decide what news is or isn't too much for the world to bear. For we have loved
    ones trapped on Seyllin as well, and they will likely die while upholding this
    founding principle of our firm. Thus, we believe that all those who remain should
    know the truth of what is coming, and be allowed the precious opportunity to say
    farewell.  \n  \nLars Kiormen, Chief Editor, SCOPE News"
