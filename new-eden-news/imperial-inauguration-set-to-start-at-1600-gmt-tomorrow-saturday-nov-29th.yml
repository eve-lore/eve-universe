- body: The Imperial Inauguration Event will begin tomorrow Saturday Nov 29th at 16:00.
    Acceptance emails will be sent out at around 12:00 GMT tomorrow. There are already
    more than fifty applicants to the event, so some will have to keep track of events
    on an ingame chat channel. We hope that the event goes as planned and the heirs
    will do their duty to the Empire and wish Doriam Kor-Azor good luck.
