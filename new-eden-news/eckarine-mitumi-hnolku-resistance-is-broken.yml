- body: "A source within the Bloodraiders, who wishes to remain anonymous, has sought
    contact with me over the last month. The news he brings is distressing. It was
    well known that the wife of murdered scientist Dr. Ullia Hnolku has been with
    the Bloodraiders for several months. There had been news already that she has
    been subjected to \u2018blooding\u2019 a ritual within the sect. \n\nA fortunate
    side effect of inhumane treatment is that it effectively breaks down once personality.
    This too has happened with Ms. Hnolku, her spirit is broken. My source tells me
    that she fought bravely against the interrogations and the relentless mental torment
    the Bloodraiders put her through. Yet, the combination of sleep deprivation, blooding,
    a low intake of food and the devastating news of her husbands\u2019 death has
    broken her spirit and her resistance. \n\nShe is nothing more then a bloodless,
    white, crawling puppet looking for a master to keep her upright. We will give
    her a new life and a new meaning. With her spirit and personality broken she is
    an empty and hollow being. We will give her a new personality and make her whole
    again - a second chance in life, a better life, because she will have a real purpose.
    We share her blood now, we are her new family. She won\u2019t be of the same ranks,
    but we will accept her for what she can offer us. She has shown great potential
    already in embracing our ways and beliefs \n\nIt is not unknown that captives
    can start to develop a sympathetic feeling towards their captors. It only takes
    a few days for this effect to settle in when there is a life threatening situation,
    without any hope of escape and random acts of kindness offered to the victims.
    Not only in hostage situation has this emotional bonding been perceived, we have
    seen it before with slaves, prisoners of wars, cults and other victims of abuse.
    Yet, what my source tells me what is happening with Ms. Hnolku takes it a few
    steps further. They are trying to erase her old personality and give her a new
    one, one that is sympathetic to their cause. It was unclear how far exactly the
    Bloodraiders are in this process and what their ultimate goal is, we highly doubt
    it is for Ms. Hnolku to lead a free and unbothered life in their midst. \n\nAt
    this time we can only dread to think what Ms.Hnolku has to offer to the Bloodraiders
    sect and what their ultimate goal is. It may give them a huge advantage over the
    alliance Ushra\u2019Khan. For the people who have forgotten about the Cure, another
    name given for Insorum, it has been discovered by accident during research against
    symptoms of allergy and its possible that Insorum will reverse all the symptoms
    of Vitoc withdrawal. It can thus be seen as the ultimate weapon against the Amarr,
    it can be considered a symbol of freedom and it can be taken as the cause of the
    approaching downfall of your civilisation. One thing is certain, it will affect
    everyone."
