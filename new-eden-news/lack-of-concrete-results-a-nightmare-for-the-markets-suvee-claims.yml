    assassination itself, but to CONCORD\u2019s inefficiency at showing results\u201D,
    says SuVee CFO. \u201CCONCORD announcing \u2018major leaps\u2019 while producing
    no concrete results and thus preventing [the Amarrian acting regent] Chamberlain
    Karsoth taking actions concerning the selection of the next Emperor is become
    a nightmare for the markets\u201D, claims a memo from Sukuuvestaa Corporation
    Financial CFO Sirotova Uesi, made public today by Suvee executives. According
    to Uesi \u201CSCC data shows that after the assassination [of Emperor Doriam II]
    the Combined Empires Market Index dropped by 11,5%. Nothing that cannot be corrected
    by authorities showing a firm grasp of the situation, yet in the present case
    lack of results has driven the CEMIx further down by an extra 3,44% this week,
    and every analysis forecasts further reductions until consumer confidence in restored.\u201D
    In contrast, \u201Cafter the death of [previous Amarrian Emperor] Heideran VII
    we saw the CEMIx shrinking by 8,73%, yet as soon as details of the Championship
    plans were leaked ten days later it crawled up 2,46%, grew another 5,85% when
    the Championship was officially announced and received a final boost of 7,38%
    as Doriam II was crowned, thus resulting in a net growth of over 6% with all fluctuations
    considered.\u201D \u201CThe CEMIx followed a similar trend after Mabnen: down
    6,32% after the attack, yet up 2,73% following the Amarrian Navy being ordered
    into action and 4,93% after the Covenant was evicted, for a net growth of almost
    1% all fluctuations considered.\u201D As reported earlier, CONCORD officials have
    refused to release any public information concerning the advance of the investigation.
    When confronted with mounting critics about CONCORD\u2019s performance and its
    economical repercussions, DED Intelligence Chief Operative Banniskore Zabulugi
    answered: \u201CWe investigate crimes here. We don\u2019t do market research.\u201D
    \\--- EDIT NOTES: -If there are too many numbers and/or note is too long, feel
    free to eliminate paragraphs #4 and #5, they add flavor but the article is readable
    without them. -Not sure why the Chancelor has not made the information with the
    CONCORD meeting public\u2026 since this is SuVee (Caldari \"practicals\"), I decided
    to make them put the bad light on CONCORD only while letting the Chamberlain off
    the hook (their lack of results \u201Cthus prevents\u201D the Chamberlain from
    acting). If PF is against this then the Chamberlain part can be eliminated from
    the phrase."
