- body: "Perkone Corporation, one of the few remaining Caldari corporations founded
    during the Industrial Age on Caldari Prime, announced today a dramatic increase
    in their sales of munitions and arms over the past few months, reversing all of
    their past trends of surplus materials and unsold stock.   \n  \nSince the war
    with the Federation, Perkone has struggled, barely managing to produce their lines
    of \"solid, high quality equipment.\" Could today\u2019s revelation breathe new
    life into this corporation, until now just a shadow of the mighty entity they
    once were?   \n  \nImmediately following the announcement by their CEO, Ronto
    Oralukka, Perkone\u2019s shares rose by 0.4 isk, and more increases are forcast
    for the coming weeks. Speculations have also been made as to what effect this
    will have on Perkone\u2019s main competitor, Rapid Assembly. \"Will the increased
    sales on Perkone\u2019s part signify the beginning of a fall in prices, potentially
    causing a significant drop in revenue from Rapid Assembly\u2019s comparable products?\"
    Is a question on the lips of many traders."
