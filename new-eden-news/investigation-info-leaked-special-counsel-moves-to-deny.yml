- body: "This just in: several major interstellar news agencies have in the past twenty-four
    hours run breaking news on a new development in the Insorzapine bisulfate investigation
    being undertaken by the CEP Business Bureau. According to a report apparently
    leaked by a top-level Bureau aide, the Insorzapine variant carried by renegade
    scientist Ullia Hnolku and his wife is in fact a drug capable of wholly reversing
    the effects of [Vitoc](http://www.eve-online.com/background/potw/feb04.asp) on
    the human body, breaking the chain of cellular addiction which keeps individuals
    hooked on the drug\u2019s antidote.   \n  \nSpecial Counsel Tar Maurisi, head
    of the Bureau\u2019s investigation, has swiftly moved to deny the claims, stating
    that they are \u201Csensationalistic propaganda spread by opportunistic parties
    interested in seeing Amarr-Caldari relations soured.\u201D While Maurisi mentioned
    no names, the consensus within diplomatic circles is that the Special Counsel\u2019s
    words were directed towards the Gallente business machine, whose interests would
    be greatly served by a rift between the Amarr and Caldari nations. No response
    has been forthcoming from the Federation at this time.   \n  \nMeanwhile, the
    news has promoted unrest among the Amarrian populace. In preparation for the eventuality
    of the drug\u2019s mass distribution, a number of holders have begun pulling their
    slaves back from specialized colonies as well as public areas, and the Amarr Navy
    is reportedly mobilizing a task force to search for the scientists. The Imperial
    Chancellor\u2019s Office refused to give comment \u201Cuntil more concrete information
    is brought to light.\u201D   \n  \nThe search for Dr. Hnolku continues, but little
    success has been had by officials moving against the scientist. It is widely whispered
    that capsuleer mercenaries have been paid to apprehend Hnolku outside the confines
    of Caldari space, but such rumours are wholly unsubstantiated at the present time.
    \  \n  \nZainou Biotech stocks have dropped a further twelve points in the time
    since the report was released. Ishukone stock has taken a three-point dive.   \n
    \ \nMore on this as it develops."
