- body: "This afternoon the Minmatar Republic\u2019s Tribal Council will convene to
    discuss the Sebiestor tribe\u2019s newly proposed and highly controversial motion
    to place a ban on ceremonial displays of the Khumaak, an ornamental weapon often
    carried by Minmatar tribal leaders and high-ranking military officers during formal
    occasions.   \n  \nThe Khumaak (literally \u201CHand of Maak\u201D) is a replica
    of an ancient Amarrian relic used 125 years ago by a Minmatar slave to kill his
    master, thereby sparking a revolt on Ezzara VI. This revolt, while precipitating
    the almost total annihilation of the Starkmanir Minmatar tribe, has in historical
    retrospect come to be credited as one of the seminal events in the larger Minmatar
    uprising. The weapon itself is a three-foot rod with a spiked solar disc on the
    top, the design of the original relic believed to date back to the pre-Reclaiming
    era of Amarrian prophet Dano Geinok. It isn\u2019t believed to have been intended
    as a weapon originally, but as a rod of command for high-ranking members of the
    Amarrian Conformist clergy.   \n  \nThe Sebiestor tribe\u2019s motion is calling
    for the Khumaak to be removed from the list of sanctioned Minmatar state, military
    and fleet apparel due to its being what the document describes as \u201Can uncomfortable
    and unnecessary reminder of past bloodshed.\" While carrying the weapon at ceremonial
    functions has never been mandatory, numerous high-ranking tribal and military
    leaders adamantly refuse to leave home without it, the general sentiment among
    them being that it stands as symbolic of both liberty and the spirit of resistance
    so interwoven with the Minmatar people\u2019s brutal history.   \n  \nIn the two
    days since the motion was put forth, prominent Krusual tribal heads have leveled
    criticism at what they perceive as diplomatic submissiveness. Taino Kwuda, Governor
    of Houdea and Krusual\u2019s leading spokesman on Matar has gone on record stating
    that the motion is \u201Ca worrying manifestation of the weak-kneed mentality
    currently afflicting many of our sisters and brothers in government.\u201D The
    Sebiestor tribe has countered these accusations by stating that now, more than
    ever, is a time when the empires need to take steps to come together under the
    banner of peace. Few comments have been heard from the Brutor tribe\u2019s representatives,
    but analysts are predicting that should the matter come to a head Brutor is more
    likely to fall on the Krusuals\u2019 side, as their tribe views the Khumaak with
    great reverence."
