- body: "The major pirate factions are all escalating the manufacturing of ships and
    armaments, to support their increased activity in the outer regions. Like others
    they must sustain their industry with a constant supply of minerals. The pirates
    have obviously taken stock of the common mining practices employed by pilots all
    over, moving about in large convoys and strip mining asteroid belts under heavy
    protection. They then use heavy haulers to move the ore back to their stations.
    \  \n  \nMilitary experts have indicated that the best way to limit the military
    build up of the pirate factions is to starve them off their industrial needs;
    thus denying them the opportunity to extend their fleet. While DED wants to focus
    on taking out the pirate havens they concede that a war of attrition and logistics
    may be more prudent while the forces of the empires are so limited in the outer
    regions. DED officials have even hinted, through unofficial channels of course,
    that they would look favorably upon those that attack pirate mining convoys on
    their own and point out that this can be a good source of income for those capable
    of overpowering the strong escort ships."
