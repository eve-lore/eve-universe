- body: 'OIJANEN - The State Peacekeepers have confirmed the status of the ongoing
    cleanup in the city of Myrskaa this afternoon, in a statement that sheds light
    on the process and gives further details on the massive logistical effort currently
    taking place on Oijanen II.


    During a press conference hosted at 13:00 NEST Today, Brigadier General Varanori
    Ruukin, Executive Officer of the State Peacekeepers, confirmed that "more than
    three quarters of the survivors of the Kyonoke outbreak within the Myrskaa Metropolitan
    area have now been screened and evacuated, thanks to the efficient efforts of
    the men and women of the State Armed Forces, and the diligent work of both Zainou
    and Ishukone staff.


    "Thankfully, several key pieces of transport infrastructure have remained in place,
    allowing the mass medivac of a little over eighteen million in seven days. Working
    around the clock, a combined force of Home Guard, State Peacekeeper, Ishukone
    Watch and Peace and Order Unit personnel have utilized a combination of airlift
    evacuations, along with all three lines of the MARTN system that link the city
    of Myrskaa with the Ruusaka District megalopolis, which lies two thousands kilometers
    to the south."


    Speaking from the operational headquarters of the State Peacekeepers, which lie
    just a hundred kilometers from the quarantine nanodomes that still prevent unauthorized
    access to the city, General Ruukin confirmed that a "large pre-fabricated settlement"
    is already nearing completion on the west side of Ruusaka, which already boasts
    a population of more than two hundred million, and that "Ruusaka''s infrastructure
    and services are more than capable of handling a population influx of this magnitude."


    At this time there has been no further comment on a date for completion of the
    cleanup operation and subsequent destruction of the city, however it has been
    confirmed by the Myrskaa Metropolitan Corporation that tenders for the contract
    to reconstruct the city have already been received by several megacorporations,
    with Sukuuvesta and Caldari Constructions currently the two front runners vying
    for a lucrative contract that sees the value of salvage rights alone estimated
    close to a trillion interstellar kredits.'
