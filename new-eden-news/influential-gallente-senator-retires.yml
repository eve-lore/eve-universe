    In a prepared statement, Gallente Senator Pillius Ardanne announced today that
    he would be retiring from the assembly effective immediately. Citing reasons of
    \"personal health,\" the statement has sent shockwaves through the Gallente political
    establishment.\n\nThough best known for his heated tirades at the podium, Ardanne
    was none the less a respected member of the Senate, holding several important
    committee positions thanks to his seniority and political connections. Chief among
    these was his post as chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, a role
    which will now fall to Senator Faron Shu, the second most senior member.\n\nThough
    his legacy will be one of energetic debate (his early rows with a much younger
    Mentas Blaque were legendary within the halls of government), Ardanne will be
    fondly remembered for his valuable contributions to Gallente political discourse
    and his tireless representation of the people of his district.\n\nArdanne will
    be succeeded by Helene Sesomme, who will be elevated from her current position
    as head of the Disctrict Parliament serving Ardanne's constituency.\n\nCiting
    doctor-patient confidentiality, Ardanne's doctor refused to comment."
