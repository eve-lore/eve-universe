- body: "Piak - Home Guard dropships have landed at the Armor Forge manufacturing
    facility on Piak III, deploying mechanized infantry to counter what is now being
    called a \u201Chostage situation\u201D. According to a statement released by Caldari
    Constructions, a rogue employee named Tibus Heth is blackmailing the corporation
    \u201Cat the expense of his own coworkers\u201D, and is threatening to kill those
    inside unless his demands are met. However, hundreds of laborers have gathered
    outside the security perimeter in apparent support of the man, and unconfirmed
    reports are circulating that only management-level Constructions employees are
    being held inside against their will inside the facility. No statement has been
    issued yet by Kaalakiota, the parent company of Home Guard, regarding the show
    of force onsite. The Constructions Armor Forge, by far the largest planetary asset
    of the corporation, is believed to be a primary supplier of industrial starship
    components and heavy equipment to several mega-corporations.   \n  \n  \n[Archive
