    Systems released a shocking statement today in which it was confirmed that over
    one hundred employees and State citizens had died from complications relating
    to human trials of a new synthetic drug named Keceratine. The drug was apparently
    designed to counter the effects of a number of rare blood disorders and was released
    for final testing six months ago to a control group consisting of a random selection
    of the corporation's employees. Although the drug's effects on healthy citizens
    were predicted to be minimal, since the trials began a high number of subjects
    have been hospitalised due to severe hemorrhaging, blood clots and the failure
    of their internal organs. In many cases the trauma was severe enough to prove
    fatal.\n\nYotal Kamura, Deputy Director of the Keceratine project at GenoTech,
    was grave as he issued a statement to the press on behalf of the corporation this
    morning, where he said that, \u201CIt is with sadness and regret that I must report
    that the recent trials of Keceratine have unfortunately caused debilitating or
    even fatal side-effects in a significant number of our test subjects \u2013 over
    ten percent of the one thousand candidates originally selected. Our condolences
    go out to those affected by this tragedy, which is unprecedented in our corporation's
    history. The drug has been withdrawn and we will be thoroughly researching the
    circumstances regarding its development and its distribution.\u201D\n\nIn regards
    to GenoTech's legal position regarding the drug's tragic impact, Kamura was quick
    to point out that \u201CAll of our employees have a clause in their contracts
    which guarantees their consent and agreement to participate in the trials of our
    new products. They are informed of which testing programs they are to be involved
    in, and in return for their cooperation they receive free healthcare and medical
    advice.\u201D He went on to remind the press that \u201Chuman trials are a compulsory
    part of the pharmaceutical development process, and without them we would fail
    to comply with State law.\u201D\n\nPeople in many quarters have been less than
    satisfied by GenoTech\u2019s statement. \u201CA drug as dangerous as this should
    not have given to this many people,\u201D stated Matti Pilisur, a technician at
    rival company Bio- Solutions. \u201CSerious mistakes have clearly been made and
    the public needs assurances that something like this will not happen again.\u201D
    Others were more scathing, including Kaalakiota Corporation executive Cho Yen-Sang,
    who insisted in response to the statement that \u201CGenoTech\u2019s license to
    operate in the pharmaceutical market should be suspended until a full investigation
    is carried out by the State.\u201D\n\nOutside of the Caldari State however, many
    observers were asking more far-reaching questions. Amelie Souchain, a Gallente
    human rights lobbyist and a spokeswoman for the Federation-based charity organisation
    Freedom Aid, expressed her concerns on GalNet, where she wrote \u201CThe treatment
    that State corporations such as GenoTech give to their employees is quite frankly
    appalling. In the Federation such treatment would be criminal. The victims were
    most likely not told anything about the drug or its potential effects. Worse still,
    those affected badly by the drug have not been offered any form of compensation.
    These Caldari are being treated more like battery animals or lab rats than human
    beings.\u201D\n\nThis setback comes at a bad time for GenoTech, whose share prices
    have been slipping for well over a year due to lacklustre sales and continued
    problems with their manufacturing facilities. Parent company Wiyrkomi Corporation
    have yet to comment about this situation, although it is almost certain that they
    will move to protect their interests by instituting changes throughout their subsidiary\u2019s
    infrastructure. \u201CIt is a bad time to be an investor or an employee of Genotech,\u201D
    commented Luto Hakikanen from Smart Kredit Share Banking in response to the news.
    \u201CHeads are almost certainly going to roll.\u201D"
