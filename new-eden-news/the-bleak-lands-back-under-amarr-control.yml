- body: 'Kourmonen - The Kourmonen system was reoccupied by forces from the 24th Imperial
    Crusade yesterday.  This marks the last Amarrian system that was held in enemy
    occupancy.


    The Tribal Liberation Force had initially made large inroads into Amarrian territories
    in the Bleak Lands, with a cohesive push occupying many Amarr systems.  This push
    effectively halted in August when forces from the 24th Imperial Crusade retook
    Huola.  Since this point the Imperial Crusade has made steady progress reclaiming
    systems lost to enemy occupation.


    Imperial Chamberlain Pomik Haromi passed on his personal congratulations at a
    press conference today praising the "devout tenacity and strength" of the capsuleer
    forces from the 24th Imperial Crusade and said the Empress herself had instructed
    him to pass on her personal commendation.  "This marks the end of Minmatar occupation
    within The Bleak Lands, we will now seek to refortify our borders and wish the
    24th God speed in taking the fight to the enemy."


    It is understood that Amarrian Heir, Yonis Ardishapur, issued a call to arms upon
    the Kourmonen system few weeks ago in an effort to re-secure the resting place
    of Saint Anam.  Several anonymous reports received also hinted that the Minmatar
    were themselves searching for this to use it as a bargaining chip for releasing
    slaves, although these reports remain unconfirmed by any official source.


    What is certain however is that the 24th Imperial Crusade is gaining more and
    more ground upon its enemies and could now throw the Minmatar on the defensive
    should they choose to push across the border.'
