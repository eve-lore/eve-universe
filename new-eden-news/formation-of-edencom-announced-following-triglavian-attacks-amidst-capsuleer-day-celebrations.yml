- body: "Yulai, Genesis - Provost Marshal Kasiha Valkanir of CONCORD's AEGIS division
    formally announced the formation of the New Eden Common Defense Initiative (EDENCOM)
    in a press conference at DED headquarters in Yulai, today. The presser follows
    a wave of attacks by Triglavian Collective forces against EDENCOM production facilities
    involved in distributing materiel to capsuleers in conjunction with the Society
    of Conscious Thought's celebration of Capsuleer Day YC122.\n\nCapsuleers have
    been urged by CONCORD to repel the Triglavian assault forces, and retrieve any
    technology and materiel taken from the previously hidden EDENCOM facilities. Marshal
    Valkanir expressed disappointment that \"our counter-intelligence efforts have
    so far not prevailed against Triglavian subversion\" but railed against \"those
    who would support the Triglavians and their invasion of New Eden.\"\n\n\"While
    preparations for a change in defensive strategy have been advanced for some time,
    it is clear to the CONCORD Inner Circle and core empires that now is the time
    to formalize a dedicated common defense pact across the cluster. The New Eden
    Common Defense Initiative is that pact and my own AEGIS division will operate
    as the central co-ordinating organization within EDENCOM. The focus of EDENCOM
    will be on accelerating the fortification of New Eden's star systems, supporting
    the member states of CONCORD in their defense efforts, and working as closely
    as possible with capsuleers loyal to the cause of our common civilization.\"\n\nPresent
    at the briefing alongside Marshal Valkanir were Inner Circle President Seri Okonaya
    and DED Star Marshal Kjersidur Elladall. While EDENCOM will take the lead in the
    new strategy of defense in depth and accelerated fortification, Marshal Elladall's
    DED forces will continue to engage in counter-Triglavian operations together with
    their many other duties in New Eden.\n\nHowever, it is understood that the Inner
    Circle's empire delegates had insisted on the establishment of a dedicated command
    organization more closely aligned with the interests of the core empires. The
    Amarr Empire and Gallente Federation had taken a particular lead in promoting
    this change as their expansive territories have borne the brunt of Triglavian
    invasion efforts. President Jacus Roden and Empress Catiz I have personally co-ordinated
    on this matter, with their respective allies and satellite states falling in line
    with the new plan.\n\n**In Related News**\n\nDED and AEGIS forces have confirmed
    that Triglavian forces continue to carry out extensive experimental operations
    on planetary surfaces across New Eden. Over the past month, systems across New
    Eden have seen populations seized and transferred to various environments. Triglavian
    experimental environments in Fliet, Dakba, Notoras, Oppold and Palmon have been
    assaulted and populations recovered by AEGIS forces, in some cases allegedly working
    with Arkombine mercenaries in the pay of the Upwell Consortium.\n\nEven today,
    Triglavian scout forces have been sighted in Geztic, Gultratren, Nani, and Passari
    following a pattern indicative of support for Triglavian surface operations. Reports
    of collaboration and subversive support for the Triglavian Collective are also
    on the rise across New Eden, with analysts speculating that Triglavian memetic
    propaganda is responsible for a number of recent incidents.\n\n**In Other News**\n\n
