    Corporation) announced today that it has completed an additional sale of [Echelon
    Entertainment](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Echelon Entertainment) assets
    in its continuing attempt to recover from [Tibus Heth''s](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tibus
    Heth) executorship. While the initial auction sold off large chunks of Echelon''s
    more high-profile properties, it retained ownership of numerous lesser known properties.


    According to records, Echelon has sold off approximately 45% of its remaining
    assets to numerous corporations across [New Eden](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/New
    Eden \(cluster\)). After being aggressive in the first auction, [NOH](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Nugoeihuvi
    Corporation) backed off this round and only picked up a few smaller holoseries.
    With the removal of Heth from power, [Gallente ](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente)and
    [Minmatar](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Minmatar) corporations were far more
    involved. [Egonics Inc.](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Egonics Inc) purchased
    the rights to several musical catalogs, while [Impetus](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Impetus)
    picked up several minor holovid properties. [The Leisure Group](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The
    Leisure Group) acquired a number of organized crime dramas - an increasingly popular
    genre in the [Minmatar Republic](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Minmatar) -
    from the Echelon catalog.


    The additional sales were forced by Heth''s theft of corporate assets which led
    to the siege of Haatomo and subsequent events. Analysts now expect Kaalakiota
    will be able to make its scheduled debt payments this quarter without taking additional
    loans. While Echelon has seen its stock tumble even further in response to the
    news, KK''s stock has risen slightly.


    The corporation released a short statement saying, "With the completion of this
    sale and the excising of unusual and needless financial drains, we are confident
    Kaalakiota Corporation will regain profitability in the coming quarter."'
