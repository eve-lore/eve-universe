    house, will not commit ritual suicide at the time of the Succession ritual of
    Doriam Kor-Azor. It is thought that Jamyl may follow in the footsteps of Khanid
    II and break away from the Amarr Empire, effectively seceding and forming an independent
    state comprised of current Sarum holdings. If this were to happen, many analysts
    consider it a precursor to a Sarum family war against the Minmatar Republic, elements
    of the extant Amarr Empire, or both. \n\n\u201CYou will remember reports of unusually
    high activity among the space lanes of the Amarr Empire following Heideran VII\u2019s
    death,\u201D said Elgad Bettild, a political analyst for Republic Fleet. \u201CSarum
    family warships and freighters were the most numerous and frequent of those sighted.
    There were rumors even then of a possible split, of course. Had Kador, Tash-Murkon,
    or Ardishapur been named the next Emperor, perhaps the other Heirs would have
    fallen in line. But Kor-Azor represents one extreme of the current Amarr political
    spectrum, and a refusal of ritual suicide isn\u2019t unthinkable, especially by
    Jamyl Sarum.\u201D \n\nAnother split, like that of Khanid II in response to his
    own impending ritual suicide, could be disastrous for an Empire already fading
    from its former glory. \u201CIf Sarum refuses to perform the ritual suicide required
    of her, the three remaining heirs would have justification to refuse it as well,\u201D
    Bettild went on to say. The ritual suicide is intended to prevent conflict and
    intrigue between the five royal houses and solidify support for the emperor, but
    a failure by any one of the four houses could topple that unity. \n\n\u201CArdishapur
    would probably perform it because of his staunch traditionalist beliefs,\u201D
    Bettild said, \u201Cbut in light of a refusal by Jamyl Sarum to end her own life,
    the other families could all justify non-compliance. Instead of a strong Amarr
    Empire, you would essentially have anywhere from three to possibly six factions
    operating independently.\u201D \n\nJamyl Sarum has not been seen since the Imperial
    Succession Committee verified the results of the Champion Tourney, and she alone
    among the royals has been silent, but the other royal families have been reserved
    in their brief and infrequent statements. \n\n\u201CA certain amount of solemnity
    is to be expected,\u201D said Ashtan Vekkan, an Amarr citizen of Ni Kunni heritage
    acting as an advisor to a Gallentean firm of industrialists (Vekkan requested
    that his client remain anonymous in connection with this story). \u201CThe Kor-Azor
    Succession is, after all, a death sentence for the other four heirs. However,
    there have been subtly worded statements\u2014omissions of statement, really\u2014that
    would indicate some hesitancy. It is for instance customary for the non-succeeding
    families to congratulate and acknowledge the family of the next emperor, and in
    some cases only congratulations have been sent\u2014not acknowledgments.\u201D
    \n\nAt the time of this writing, there are unconfirmed reports of Kador, Tash-Murkon,
    and Sarum representatives convening in semi-secret meetings in the Throne Worlds
    constellation of Amarr space. Though possibly just rumor, such a meeting could
    be interpreted as trouble for the house of Kor-Azor, the next intended Amarr Emperor.
    \u201CIt is strange and terrible to think that we have seen the last true emperor,\u201D
    Vekkan said when questioned about these alleged meetings. \u201CBut it is a strange
    and terrible time in many ways. All things come to an end\u2014even empires.\u201D"
