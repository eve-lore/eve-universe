- body: "As the Federation shifts into election gear, billions of voters across Gallente
    space prepare to cast their votes in what looks to become one of the most hotly
    contested elections in the nation\u2019s history.   \n  \nAccording to the latest
    numbers from the Federation\u2019s polling bureaus, presidential candidate Senator
    Mentas Blaque is currently in the lead with a public support rating of 54% to
    incumbent President Souro Foiritan\u2019s 46%.   \n  \nThis past summer has seen
    a steady increase in incendiary political speech by Senator Blaque and his campaign
    office, as well as by members of the President\u2019s cabinet. The President himself,
    meanwhile, has been consistently reluctant to engage in direct confrontation with
    the Senator, conducting his personal communications with such care that Sovicou
    Star chief editor Nelvine Ducomp in a July 27th editorial famously referred to
    his condition as \u201Ca rare case of actual diplomacy, one we all hope he recovers
    from soon.\u201D   \n  \nFoiritan, previously known for aggressive debating techniques
    and extreme political fierceness, has this summer instead channeled his energy
    into extensive campaigning in the Federation\u2019s fringe districts. Of particular
    note have been his excursions into districts such as Chappel and Lavoux, areas
    with high concentrations of Intaki and Matari immigrants and historically low
    voter turnout.   \n  \nBlaque\u2019s platform is concerned primarily with, in
    the Senator\u2019s own words, \u201Creclaiming a sense of national pride\u201D
    and \u201Cmaking sure our own people are cared for before tending to the needs
    of others.\u201D His promises of widespread domestic economic reform have met
    with resounding approval, and his large bloc of followers have been noted time
    and again for their almost religious zeal.   \n  \nFoiritan\u2019s platform, meanwhile,
    revolves around foreign policy and free trade, concepts that have been at the
    core of Gallente political thought since the days of the Gallente-Caldari war
    almost a century ago.   \n  \nElection day is scheduled for October 27th."
