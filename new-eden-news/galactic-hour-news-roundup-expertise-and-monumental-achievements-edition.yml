    The Forge - Capsuleer Expert Systems providing supplementary access to pilots
    skills are launching today as the latest radical new service offered by the PKN
    Interstellar consortium. Based on clone gelbrain and skill injector technology,
    together with Lai Dai's subcranial nanocontroller technology, the \"Expert Systems\"
    are specially configured biocomputers that remotely add their skills to those
    of the capsuleer renting time on the service. PKN Interstellar is believed to
    be guaranteeing real-time communication via its proprietary HyperNet FTL communications
    network.\n\nDespite the appearance of advanced artificial intelligence being used
    in contravention of the Yulai Accords, the PKN Interstellar consortium has responded
    to criticisms along these lines by noting the certification of \"Restricted AI
    Compliance\" it has received from CONCORD's Department for Enforcement of Restrictions
    on Artificial Intelligence and Life (DERAIL).\n\nPKN's Expert Systems services
    are initially being made available in a variety of packages supporting core ship
    operations, mining and exploration. PKN member and media powerhouse Nugoeihuvi
    megacorp is taking a leading role in marketing the services under its existing
    \"Expert\" branding but the services have been developed with contributions from
    a number of PKN members and partner corporations.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/Doriam_II_Eclipticum.png)

    Empire Completes Monuments to Emperor Doriam II and Empress Jamyl I**\n\nAmarr,
    Domain - Monuments to two past rulers of the Amarr Empire have been erected in
    key systems of the Amarr Empire, according to reports from Amarr Certified News
    (ACN). Emperor Doriam II reigned from YC105 to YC107 and a monument to him has
    been placed in Kor-Azor Prime system at the order of Royal Heir Ersilia Kor-Azor.
    Empress Jamyl I reigned from YC111 to YC117 and a monument to her has been placed
    in Sarum Prime system at the order of Royal Heir Arrach Sarum.\n\nThe monument
    to Emperor Doriam II orbits the planet Eclipticum (Kor-Azor Prime IV), named for
    the capsuleer champion who led the Kor-Azor team to victory in the YC105 Amarr
    Succession Trials. Emperor Doriam II carried out a successful foreign policy based
    on the peaceful policies of his predecessor Heideran VII. His reign also saw a
    campaign to reclaim systems in the Bleak Lands overrun by Blood Raider cultists.
    While this campaign was overwhelmingly successful, Emperor Doriam II was subsequently
    assassinated in the Imperial Palace. It is now believed that members of the \"Red
    Chamberlain\" Dochuta Karsoth's cult cell were behind the YC107 slaying of Doriam.\n\nThe
    monument to Empress Jamyl I has been placed above Mekhios (Sarum Prime III), amongst
    the wreckage of the ship graveyard marking the Battle of Mekhios, the occasion
    of her dramatic return, apparently from the dead, and her victory over a marauding
    Minmatar fleet. Jamyl was acclaimed Empress in the aftermath of the Elder Fleet
    invasion's defeat, and instituted a number of innovations in the administration
    of the Amarr Empire. Her reign was marked by the appointment of Royal Houses to
    oversee various arms of the Imperial bureaucracy and outlying territories, and
    the reunification of the Khanid Kingdom with the Amarr Empire. Empress Jamyl I
    was killed when her personal _Avatar_ -class Titan was destroyed by a Drifter
    strike force in YC117.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/Project_Discovery_Phase_Two.png)

    Across New Eden**\n\nYulai, Genesis - CONCORD's Project Discovery and Independent
    Gaming Commission divisions have unveiled their own monuments to the achievements
    of the capsuleer community in recent years. A monument to Project Discovery's
    second phase, the exoplanets hunting effort led by Professor Michel Mayor, has
    been established in the Pakhshi system, orbiting the twentieth moon of Pakhshi
    IX. The Independent Gaming Commission has established its monument in the form
    of statue personifying \"Victory\" and an array of pedestals marking the winners
    of the popular capsuleer Alliance Tournaments, placing it in orbit of Manarq V.\n\nIn
    addition to these monuments, the  legendary capsuleer industrialist Chribba has
    been honored with a statue in the Amarr system. A joint project of the HZO Refinery
    corporation and the Upwell Consortium, the statue of Chribba was authorized for
    placement in the first asteroid belt of Amarr VIII by the Court Chamberlain on
    behalf of Empress Catiz I. The monument honors Chribba's services to the industrial
    development of Amarr, his work with Amarr mining corporations, and his many efforts
    to promote ethical capsuleer trade.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/Alliance_Tournament_Monument.png)

    Catiz I Begins Unannounced Tour of Ammatar Mandate**\n\nTanoo, Derelik - Empress
    Catiz I has begun a previously unannounced tour of the Ammatar Mandate, according
    to reports from ACN. The visit is being reported as a \"lengthy tour of inspection\"
    of the Ammatar Mandate, a territory controlled by the Royal House of Ardishapur
    and administered by Lord Governor Ekroz Salaf, the first Ammatar to be elevated
    to the Amarr holder nobility.\n\nEmpress Catiz I travelled to the Ammatar capital
    world of Tanoo II with her personal honor guard fleet and is being accompanied
    on the tour by Royal Heir Arim Ardishapur. Imperial Navy and Ammatar Fleet units
    are on high alert across the Ammatar Mandate, with border patrols by local forces
    supplemented by Imperial Navy and Imperial Guard units.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/Tanoo_Catiz_I_Honor_Guard.png)
