- body: "SEYLLIN 1052 - Unable to receive assistance from Federation dropships, citizens
    trapped in the underground cities of Seyllin have taken to transmitting their
    pleas for help in any way they can. Military vessels and civilians alike are now
    receiving distress calls numbering in the hundreds of thousands from as far as
    three systems away. Others stuck on the planet are simply capturing and transmitting
    the surrounding chaos.   \n  \nOne terrible theme has been present throughout
    each recounting of the events that lead to this disaster: intense heat. As millions
    more remain desperate to leave the horror, all they can do is plead and hope to
    whoever will listen, and what few who can help.   \n  \nOne of Seyllin's own holovid
    networks was rerouted to an auditorium in Southern Cross, where local city administrators
    tried to use it to organize an orderly evacuation. The broadcast quickly attracted
    the attention of desperate residents however, and the feed was eventually cut
    off amidst the chaos of thousands more rushing the already-packed arena. Although
    badly distorted, pictures captured during the brief transmissions showed firsthand
    the horror visited upon the people of Seyllin, who were clearly suffering from
    radiation burns and poisoning."
