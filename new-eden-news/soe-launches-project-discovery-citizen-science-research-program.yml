- body: 'X-7OMU - The Sisters of EVE have launched a citizen science research program
    codenamed "[Project Discovery](http://www.eveonline.com/discovery/)", aimed at
    achieving a comprehensive categorization and analysis of tissue samples acquired
    from the Drifters since their emergence in early YC117.


    Professor Lundberg, Chief Scientist for the SOE advanced research division, said:
    "It is of great importance for Project Discovery that as many capsuleers as possible
    take part. We believe that a proper understanding of the underlying biology of
    the Drifters will lead to great discoveries and advancements that will benefit
    all citizens of New Eden."


    Citizen science is something of a novel approach for the usually secretive Sisters
    of EVE, however the concept has been used many times in the history of the GalNet
    and planetary communications networks. The SOE believe that the unique awareness
    and capabilities of capsuleers will be of great benefit to the effort to analyze
    the Drifter tissue sample database that will be used in the Project Discovery
    research program.


    Further coverage of ongoing developments with the Drifters and Project Discovery
    can be found in the lastest [special report from the Scope](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLtgO8ODr_M).'
