    - A tense standoff between the security forces of Roden Shipyards and the Federation
    government is underway at the corporation's headquarters in Alentene. SCOPE has
    learned that the altercation began shortly after Federal Intelligence Office (FIO)
    agents arrived to enforce President Foiritan's executive mandate to nationalize
    arms manufacturers.\n\nGovernment officials have closed access to the scene by
    reporters. Sources report that Jacus Roden, the retired founder of Roden Shipyards,
    personally refused to allow federal agents to enter the facility. A brief statement
    released by the corporation reads as follows:\n\n\"Our position is that the president
    has no legal authority to commandeer the operations of this firm. The Federation
    government is therefore trespassing on private property. We have no intentions
    of escalating this matter further, but we refuse to yield ground on the issue.\"\n\nMomentum
    is gathering in the senate to proceed with an impeachment hearing-the first for
    a president in decades. Lawmakers worked through the night lobbying for votes,
    as fresh polls show that President Souro Foiritan's popularity has dropped to
    a record low, with just 26% of respondents viewing the president's performance
    favorably.\n\nJacus Roden, known to be a capsuleer, is the largest single shareholder
    of the corporation bearing his name. He retired more than twenty years ago, but
    not before installing his granddaughter Miloise Roden as CEO. She has since extended
    the company lines of business into \"super-capital\" ventures that include terraforming
    operations and the construction of advanced warships for the Federation Navy.\n\nThis
    is a SCOPE breaking news story. More coverage will follow as details emerge."
