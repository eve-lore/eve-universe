    Deep Core Mining Inc. announced their quarterly earnings this week, exceeding
    analyst expectations by nearly 10%.  While many of the gains have been company-wide,
    as infrastructure investments facilitated by CAESA funds have finally begun paying
    dividends, the greatest improvements have been in their Tasen and Otawasa operations.
    \ The latter recently went through a significant reorganization after an accident
    at the Kaunokka III-1 facility several months ago, which many analysts believe
    contributed to the improvement.\n\nAccording to the company's financial statements,
    worker productivity and actual production volume have both increased significantly
    since this time last year, and several new trading strategies have allowed the
    company to take better advantage of fluctuations in mineral prices.  The company
    has also canceled plans for a new bond issue, which some investors had worried
    would be necessary after several quarters of painful losses.\n\nAt the Kaunokka
    III-1 facility, workers don't seem to be surprised by the report.  \"Workers here
    are much more productive and safety-conscious since the reorganization, and overall
    I think we're running a tight ship these days,\" said Reita Wotimi, the newly
    promoted chief technical officer at the mining outpost.  \"It's still dangerous
    work, but we're spending a lot less on sick leave these days.\"\n\nDue to challenging
    environmental conditions, the Kaunokka strip mine is still a hazardous place.
    Last week, two workers suffered heavy injuries in a vehicle crash at one of the
    sites; however, both the miners and the medical officials agree that these are
    unavoidable. \"That's why we get paid twice as much,\" said one of the injured
    workers. \"All we asked for is for our bosses not to increase the level of danger
    any further by their actions. We're happy the new managers keep that in mind.\""
