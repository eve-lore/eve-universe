- body: "Pilots from all over the Caldari state were unexpectedly called to arms earlier
    this week by security forces from Deep Core Mining Inc. The security forces sent
    the many pilots they hired out to scout and secure solar systems surrounding the
    Paara system and more specifically the DCM station, immediately.   \n  \nThe pilots
    were not made aware of what they were looking for, only to report back \u201Csuspicious
    pirate activity\u201D. When they were given the reason for this mission, however,
    the reason for the lack of details became apparent.   \n  \nThey were scouting
    out the systems, clearing all opposition to make way for a Mordus convoy of unknown
    purpose. When the pilots found out who they were working for the seeds of dissention
    began to spread. One pilot who wishes to remain nameless broke the wall of secrecy
    surrounding this operation to speak to me, saying \u201Che didn\u2019t trust the
    Mordus further than he could throw them\u201D.   \n  \nThis is the second time
    that both the Legion and DCM have been discovered to be pulling off unusual activity
    in the last week. Several days ago a Legion escort mission didn\u2019t show up
    to protect a convoy of ORE industrials out of the syndicate region, and DCM were
    embarrassed just a day before that particular incident when a trader who sold
    many delicacies such a spiced wine and long limb roes, spoke out into public communication
    channels asking if the purchases were related, embarrassing the DCM representatives
    who seemed to try to cover it up. Sources within Deep Core Mining claim that one
    executive has been fired over the incident, although we can not get official confirmation
    at this point..   \n  \nWhy DCM didn\u2019t use their own security forces for
    this operation is the subject of speculation, some parties, mostly the pilots
    hired, believe it is because the DCM security forces could not hope to match the
    experience and firepower that the pilots themselves brought, whilst others believe
    it is because the DCM executives were trying to keep this operation low key and
    secretive, and amassing their forces would arouse suspicion. Certainly the local
    DCM executives were adamant that information was not released to anyone.   \n
    \ \nWe do not have further information about the convoy, as all of the pilots
    were paid and dispersed. However, this event is becoming less likely to have a
    mundane reason by the second."
