- body: "ALENIA. An escaped inmate from a mental institution was captured by CONCORD
    while he was recruiting pod-pilots as a custom officer. \n\nWith ad-hoc help from
    local pilots, CONCORD Commander Plavers and Lieutenant Temasi managed to capture
    an escaped inmate from the Telho-Metremly Sanctuary mental institution. The fugitive,
    ex-Caldari Navy officer Mikael Kord, offered little resistance and was handed
    over to the Sanctuary agents to be returned to the institution. \n\nApparently
    believing he was a custom officer, Mr. Kord was recruiting pod-pilots in the region,
    letting them take a few tests and even showing them a few examples.\n\nWitnesses
    declared that Mr. Kord was acting \"as normally as can be expected\" from a customer
    officer, and since it isn't strange for pod-pilots to receive freelance contract
    offers through the FTL communication channels no one suspected he was insane until
    CONCORD officials arrrived with a capture order. Cmdr Plavers managed to take
    control of Mr. Kord navigation systems ending the incident without further disruption
    among the local population. \n\nAccording to his CalNav record, former hot-shot
    Mr. Kord has retired from duty and brought into psychiatric care after suffering
    a nano-fracture in his pod during a routine patrol. Somehow the breach affected
    his left hemisphere synaptic pathways, later altering his neural patterns and
    leaving him unable to differentiate reality from his imagination. \n\nIt's not
    clear how Mr. Kord managed to escape from the institution, and rumors abound that
    he was not alone. \"As far as CONCORD is concerned, only one inmate from Telho-Metremly
    Sanctuary was reported missing,\" said Cmdr Plavers. \"How Mr. Kord managed to
    get out is none of CONCORD business.\" \n\nTelho-Metremly Sanctuary authorities
    were not available for comment."
