- body: "Luminaire \u2013 The Scope has obtained an FIO report detailing the existence
    of a secret prison on Caldari Prime holding most dangerous criminals, political
    prisoners, and captured members of the Gallente resistance forces. According to
    excerpts of the story, due to be published tomorrow, the prison is in fact an
    evacuated underwater dome arcology formerly known as Paix Azur, now largely evacuated
    and run by the Provist occupational authority.\n\nOriginating from \u201Creliable
    sources within the Federal Intelligence Office,\u201D the leaked report indicates
    that the evacuation of the city began soon after the beginning of the occupation.
    The FIO learned of its existence two weeks ago, after Caldari evacuees from the
    city began to filter into the major cities from quarantine zones. Federation intelligence
    assets had spotted the higher traffic to the city since the beginning of the occupation,
    but until recently the true nature of these flights was not known. According to
    the report, there may have been as many as 5000 flights during the first months
    of the occupation, indicating an evacuation on an unprecedented scale.\n\nAccording
    to the leak, the discovery of the city's transformation into a prison facility
    was made after correlating hundreds of reports from Gallente resistance forces,
    FIO assets, and public Caldari sources. Reports of people simply disappearing
    after capture, even after intense investigation by FIO agents, gave the initial
    impression that the Caldari were shipping them offworld, but this was ruled out
    when when images surfaced showing one of the missing prisoners being interrogated
    by Provist personnel known to be on Caldari Prime.\n\nLittle is known of the conditions
    inside Paix Azur, although the report estimates somewhere between 18,000 and 20,000
    based on correlated reports, logistical requirement estimates, and rumors among
    the Caldari occupation force. However, the report does not specify how many of
    those are likely to be prisoners and how many to be guards or support personnel.\n\nReaction
    to initial news of this report has been swift from all corners. The FIO has declined
    to comment, neither confirming nor denying the existence of the report, while
    the Caldari Provincial Directorate has put out a statement confirming the existence
    of the prison, saying that it is \u201Cnecessary for the safety and security of
    the civilian population of Caldari Prime, Caldari and Gallente alike.\u201D The
    Senate Intelligence Committee has promised to hold hearings on the matter, though
    they will likely be closed-door, while the Sisters of Eve have expressed concern
    and have asked the occupational authority for permission to inspect conditions
    inside the arcology."
