    Prime - Royal Heir Yonis Ardishapur has just addressed the Amarr Empire in a widely
    telecast speech. Speaking from the steps of his palace on Ardishapur Prime, the
    heir outlined several strategies for dealing with the aftermath, offered words
    of comfort to those affected, and pledged to use his personal resources to ensure
    the tragedy was dealt with as completely as possible.\n\n\"You can never prepare
    for a day like this,\" he said, \"when the cruelty and evil of the world for one
    terrible moment reveal themselves in the heart of your home. A great blow has
    been dealt us this day, but to the brave and loyal souls of the Empire I say:
    you have faced worse before, and you have prevailed. You now stand faced with
    this, and now too will you prevail. As God is my witness, we shall weather this
    storm.\"\n\n\"And make no mistake either that a great man has fallen today. His
    decades of contribution to the well-being of our nation will pass safe into the
    realm of history. But let us not forget the other thousands who rejoined our Lord
    today. Let their sacrifice, and all the pain it's caused us, be the bedrock from
    which we launch our retribution against those who would harm us. And let no man,
    woman or child in New Eden think that the Empire will ever let itself be cowed
    by brutality. Not now, not forever. Amarr Victor.\"\n\nSeveral detachments from
    Ardishapur's personal fleet have been scrambled and are en route to Pashanai bearing
    medical supplies and personnel. The casualty figures appear to have leveled off
    by this point, with the latest reported total standing at 5563."
