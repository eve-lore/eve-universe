- body: "The Isukone Corporation late today issued a statement disclosing the apparent
    disappearance of Ishukone-owned transport and hauling vessels in the Domain region.
    Carrying an undisclosed cargo, the convoy disappeared after stopping for refitting
    and repairs at an Ishukone Corporation factory station in the Mista system en
    route to its pre-filed destination at a Zoar and Sons factory station in Misaba.
    Ishukone is offering a 50M isk reward for information leading to the safe return
    of its pilots and cargo. \n\nFrom their headquarters in Malkalen, Ishukone representatives
    divulged details regarding the situation, including the approximate time and place
    of its disappearance, Ishukone's subsequent contact with CONCORD and their subsidiary
    DED regarding the disappearance, and all parties' subsequent failure in locating
    the missing ships or pilots or learning anything about their whereabouts. After
    providing summary information on this incident, an Ishukone spokesperson announced
    the fifty million isk reward, provided to whoever locates the missing convoy and
    its cargo, intact. \n\nCONCORD officials decline comment, other than to release
    an official statement saying, \"Ships still do occasionally go missing. We are
    not now treating this as a crime of violence or piracy, but of course have not
    ruled out any possibilities. Investigations are ongoing.\" \n\nInevitably, rumors
    circulate regarding what could prompt such a large reward offer from Ishukone.
    Ishukone, once the least significant of the three major Caldari megacorporations,
    was the first to establish trade relations with various Jovian corporations and
    governmental bodies, and the first to receive capsule construction schematics
    and integration technology from the Jovians. This, combined with early trade successes
    and ongoing friendly relations with the Impro, Shapeset, and other Jovian companies,
    established Ishukone as the leader in progressive technology and radical innovation.
    \n\nIshukone still enjoys close ties to various Jovian private and state entities,
    and is universally considered to have the most advanced technological products
    outside of Jovian space. Needless to say, speculation on the cargo carried by
    the now-missing Ishukone convoy runs to the fantastic, with rumors of new Jovian
    technology, production prototypes, even wild tales of data necessary for the construction
    of gates leading to the as-yet inaccessible Jove Empire. \n\nWhen asked for comment,
    Tsilo Ralttilo, Commander of Ishukone's Internal Security division, brushed off
    the rumors as unfounded. \"You can be sure that if we were to transport any of
    those sorts of things, it would be under the highest security. In any event, Ishukone
    I.S. has a long-standing policy of not commenting on Ishukone operations. \" The
    convoy's stated destination would also tend to counter-indicate far-fetched tales.
    If Ishukone were transporting advanced technological prototypes, it would be highly
    unlikely that they would be providing them to an Amarr customer like Zoar and
    Sons, a comparatively modest corporation specializing in ammunition production,
    common ship modules, and small-scale consumer electronics. \n\nRegardless, the
    50M isk reward is almost unprecedented, and would seem to indicate a sense of
    urgency from Ishukone. Search parties are already being organized in the Domain
    region. Ishukone has told reward seekers that the ships and cargo can be identified
    by a security code reading \"YHU678,\" and have asked anyone with information
    regarding this convoy, its disappearance, or its current whereabouts to contact
    the DED officer in charge of the investigation, Commander Blight, who was unavailable
    for comment at the time of this writing."
