- body: "The empires are hard at work collecting body parts in order to win the favor
    of the Jovians. According to the latest information, however, scammers are undermining
    their efforts to buy back body parts through the open market. Due to the scammers
    it has been all but impossible for the commissioners working for the empires to
    find customers. This has forced their hands into changing tactics. Thus, after
    consulting with the SCC and empire representatives at CONCORD, the commissioners
    have decided to cancel their market orders forthwith.   \n  \nStarting next week
    they will instead revert back to the age old system of direct trade, bypassing
    the SCC markets. The commissioners will set up shop at specific locations at specific
    times and engage in direct one-on-one trade with anyone wishing to sell their
    body parts to the empires. The same criteria for minimum order size will prevail,
    and the price will also be the same. The empires are confident that this simple
    system will finally allow them to get their hands on the body parts. Details on
    the exact place and time for each commissioner will be revealed later on."
