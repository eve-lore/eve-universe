    missing research databases, and the widespread pirating of collated findings,
    Crielere Labs is slowly going dark. Defiant in the echoing halls of the joint
    institution, officially known as the Caldari-Gallente Research Facility, project
    founders Henric Touvolle and Taromi Umailen today held a brief press conference
    denouncing the \u201Clack of vision responsible for jeopardizing humanity\u2019s
    greatest hopes.\u201D The fate of the facility remains unclear, but many of the
    research projects that called it home have been abandoned.   \n  \nTouvolle and
    Umailen took turns reading their emotional and dramatic statement, which contained
    obvious barbs against the Caldari State and Gallente Federation, as well as the
    scientists who abandoned the project. \u201CWe remain committed to the ideals
    behind the founding of this joint effort, and will continue in our work to bring
    scientific minds together for mutual inspiration and enlightenment, regardless
    of their citizenship or origin. Science owes no petty fealties to the governments
    of man, which flow and ebb and contain all the paltry failings of the men they
    are comprised of. Science alone is transcendent, and it is to that transcendence
    that we owe our allegiance.\u201D   \n  \nA skeleton crew of scientists still
    exists at the facility, but the once busy labs are largely empty as the legion
    of beleaguered and disillusioned researchers has gradually been wooed away by
    lucrative offers or left of their own accord to return to their homes.   \n  \nThough
    estimates vary, it is widely believed fully half of the assembled research staff
    at Crielere left to pursue lucrative offers pouring in from private sector enterprises
    from all over. Suntumainen Otsadan, an acquisitions manager for Lai Dai Corporation
    stationed at LDC\u2019s Uedama VII factory station offers some insight on one
    aspect of the desertion. \u201CI had a professor at Science and Trade that often
    said \u2018Pure research feeds angels. Application feeds the rest of us.\u2019
    All of the advances made by Crielere Labs are pointless unless put to good use,
    and the brilliant minds involved in projects there deserve greater compensation
    that promises of academic immortality. This was bound to happen\u2014even theoretical
    scientists have to eat. After a few months when these great talents were earning
    a fraction of what their skills would bring on the open market, of course they
    got tired of throwing away their earning potential. Shrewd businesses recognized
    the opportunity. What was going on at Crielere was certainly high-minded, but
    the work gets done when metal meets mettle.\u201D   \n  \nThough chiefly a Caldari-Gallente
    endeavor, Crielere lured deep thinkers from all over, and Caldari scientists are
    not alone in pursuing profit over potential. Ongidi Eurboder, a Personnel Manager
    for Core Complexion Inc. stationed at the CCI factory station orbiting Gare VIII
    in the Alselbosier constellation of Placid, approached scientists of Minmatar,
    Gallente, and Caldari origin. \u201CA lot of these guys have families, and with
    CCI stations in Gallente space close to Caldari regions, we\u2019ve got both State
    and Federation citizens covered, and the Minmatar scientists can always transfer
    to one of our stations back home. CCI\u2019s offering a great combination of pay
    and location, and I\u2019m pleased to say we\u2019ve had more than few former
    Crielere researchers join our ranks.\u201D Location is apparently an issue for
    many. Said Jestin Mornu, a scientist formerly working for the R&D; division of
    Roden Shipyards, \u201CI miss my wife and child. It is just that simple. The advancement
    of science is important, of course it is, but so is family. Many of my colleagues
    are following money\u2014and I don\u2019t fault them for that. But me, I am following
    my heart.\u201D Mornu has plans to return home and, \u201Ctry to get my old job
    back. My superiors at Roden told me I would always have a job waiting for me there.
    I\u2019m going to hold them to their word.\u201D   \n  \nFinally, for some, it
    is neither love nor money, but the promise of continued research unfettered by
    \u201Cidealistic trappings.\u201D Ni-Kunni researcher Emach Bashhamen is \u201Cpursuing
    offers closer to home,\u201D that he says \u201Care firmly grounded in the realities
    of our times.\u201D Like many of his former peers, Bashhamen was working on field
    generation physics with a mostly Caldari team at Crielere, and is reported to
    have made significant advances in reducing the energy requirements of both pulse
    and field generation technology. \u201CThis sort of science has many possible
    applications,\u201D Bashhamen said, \u201Cwhich I am most looking forward to exploring.\u201D
    \  \n  \nMeanwhile back at Crielere, Touvolle and Umailen are looking more like
    forsaken visionaries than proud idealists. At the conclusion of their joint statement,
    in which they once again expressed their \u201Cfervent and committed dedication\u201D
    to continue their work at Crielere, the two refused to answer questions from the
    press and retreated to their offices. Shortly thereafter CONCORD representatives
    requested all in attendance of the conference to make their way back to \u201Cmore
    secure locales as soon as possible.\u201D Though declining to comment officially,
    a DED officer present at the conference acknowledged, off the record, that an
    increase in organized criminal activity in Crielere had been observed, and was
    cause for apparent concern. As traffic streamed away from the Crielere complex,
    it was easily apparent that more ships were leaving Crielere than had arrived\u2014even
    more scientific staff was taking advantage of the safety of the convoy of ships,
    and was leaving the research facility for good.   \n  \nFrom space, the spinning
    rings of the Caldari-Gallente Research Facility glitter like a rare and fragile
    jewel, flanked by an unlikely pair of giants: traditional research stations, one
    Gallentean, one Caldari, both bristling with shielding and sentry defenses. Crielere
    Labs has lost practically all of its funding, its most promising achievements
    have been looted, and finally all but the last of its staff has left. The fate
    of the facility, and of its ideals, is uncertain, but looking back on it prior
    to warping out, one could not help but lament the lofty and frail principles apparently
    dying there, and feel that its days are sadly numbered."
