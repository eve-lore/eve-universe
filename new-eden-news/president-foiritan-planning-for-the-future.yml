- body: "Souro Foiritan, president of the Gallente Federation, is poised to push through
    constitutional changes that would allow him to run again for president when his
    current term expires in two years time. The current constitution mandates that
    the president can only serve a single term of five years. But Foiritan wants to
    ensure he has enough time to act out on his promise to hunt down the UDI terrorists
    that have been plaguing the Federation for months, culminating in the infamous
    Elarel massacre a little over five months ago.   \n  \nAll constitutional changes
    needs the support of the Senate and Foiritan is already applying all of his political
    pressure on it for the bill to pass. Political experts predict this will be tough,
    as Mentas Blaque, the leader of the Senate, is a sworn enemy of the president
    and will undoubtedly do everything in his power to keep the bill from becoming
    law. Indeed, a spokesperson for Blaque\u2019s political alliance, the Sociocrats,
    has already criticized the motion, stating that the alleged terrorist hunting
    is simply a smoke screen and that the real agenda is Foiritan\u2019s endless thirst
    for power and prestige.   \n  \nThe first session discussing the president\u2019s
    proposals will be held tomorrow in the Senate, where Foiritan himself will introduce
    it. Heated debates are expected, though much of the arm-wrestling will undoubtedly
    take place behind the scenes. The reception the president gets in the Senate will
    though go a long way in determining the chances of his bold measure to go through.
    Some political analysts even go so far as to claiming that a disastrous reception
    might mean the end of this most colorful and energetic president the Federation
    has seen in ages."
