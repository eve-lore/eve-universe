    Mysterious Data Slices Discovered\n\nCapsuleers are reporting the discovery of
    mysterious data elements called \u201Cspectral emission slices\u201D. These slices
    appear to contain temporal and spatial data. So far only part of the total data
    set has been recovered. The exact meaning of the information within is still unclear.
    While many theories have been suggested, none have yet been corroborated. \n\nThis
    data is being conveyed in an unfamiliar format that emits trace blackbody radiation.
    It is not known who created the data or for what purpose. All that is known is
    that the slices have been discovered emerging from Abyssal rifts impacted by the
    conflict between the Triglavians and the Drifters; Deepflow Rifts and those under
    investigation by Abyssal Artifact Recovery operations.\n\nThe Scope reached out
    to SOCT scientists for answers, but they declined to comment. It is hoped that
    as more slices emerge so will greater insights into their meaning and origins.
    We will have more on this story as it unfolds.\n\n![SOE Zarzakh](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/1d1gKuMzZ0czkLJwVwcNrf/c103882bb2c1d762e3c821ded59cae51/SOEZarzakh.png)\n###
    NET Resonators Deathless Origins Unmasked\n\nYulai - The CDIA has released the
    details of an investigation that proves NET resonators were developed by criminal
    organization, the Deathless Circle. NET resonators emerged as an advanced ship
    manufacturing component some months ago, replacing the need for neurolink conduits
    in subcapitals. Since then the component has been adopted by groups as diverse
    as the Sisters of EVE, Guristas Pirates, Sansha\u2019s Nation, Blood Raiders,
    and more.\n\nThe revolutionary ship manufacturing component makes use of quantum
    consciousness neurolinking technology to provide the same performance as two different
    neurolink conduits in a single device. The CDIA has confirmed that this was backward-engineered
    from Jovian technology. The Deathless Circle has used its access to the Jovian
    station known as \u201CThe Fulcrum\u201D to develop new advances based on ancient
    Jovian technologies.\n\nThe CDIA also presented evidence of multiple correlations
    between the introduction of the NET resonators and visits to organizations from
    known Deathless Circle agents. Most damning of these was evidence that leading
    members of the SOE had met with Deathless agents to receive the technology.\n\nThe
    Scope reached out to the SOE to explain their organization's connection with this
    known criminal group. Santimona Sarpati responded, \u201CWe in no way solicited
    the attention of the Deathless Circle, but were approached by one of their agents
    regardless. They offered to provide us with designs that would allow us to spend
    less on our ship development and more on our efforts to explore New Eden and support
    its people. After much debate, we decided it would be irresponsible not to make
    use of this technology.\u201D\n\nThe motivations for this apparently charitable
    donation remain unclear, as do the specifics negotiated between the Deathless
    Circle and the more dangerous factions they have provided with NET resonators.
    \n\n### News In Brief\n\n- Skirmishes in G3D-ZT have escalated into a dreadnought
    clash causing over 1.1 trillion ISK worth of damage. It is the most costly fight
    ever in the system's history.\n\n- Rumors spread of growing tensions between Guristas,
    Angels, and Deathless as news of NET resonator gift to SOE spreads.\n\n- Alliance
    Tournament XX seeding concluded with several teams opting for heavy assault missile
    platforms, possibly attempting to curry favor with the Guristas organizers.\n\n-
    SOCT invites open applications from children across New Eden as part of new educational
    initiative.\n\n- Alexander Ducasse speaks in defense of NET resonators at tech
    conference panel."
