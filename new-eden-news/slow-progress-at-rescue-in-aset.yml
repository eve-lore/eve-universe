- body: 'Aset - The continuing rescue operation at an asteroid mine in the Aset system
    reported slow progress in their efforts to rescue the trapped mining crews.


    According to the Khalial Vik, head of emergency operations for Minmatar Minining

    The teams are looking into the source of the system failures but they remain unable
    to explain them at the present time.'
