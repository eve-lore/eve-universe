- body: '_Torrinos -_ Ina Okonada and Aikabinen Unijila, two Provist commanders piloting
    stolen Caldari Navy Phoenix-class dreadnaughts, were killed in Torrinos today
    by a force just shy of 400 capsuleers. Despite the losses, several high-value
    capsuleer ships were lost in the fighting, including a Tengu and a Kronos.


    Despite the capsuleer losses, the Provist forces lost even more, as 4 stolen Raven
    Navy Issues were also destroyed by capsuleer forces. The Caldari Navy is calling
    the operation a victory, saying, "The mutinous ''Octopus'' squadron defectors
    are learning the folly of their ways. Capsuleer forces stand behind the State,
    not the fallen regime of Tibus Heth."


    Unijila''s Phoenix was finished off by Stanton Warrior, while the top damage was
    dealt by Dania Arneth, and the pod destroyed by Krimsy. Top battleship damage
    was claimed by Memsi Craft, top battlecruiser damage was dealt by Bussinka, Xenias
    Gigawatt claimed top cruiser damage, Cthu Xadi dealt the most destroyer damage,
    and top frigate was KamchatkaALEX. Okonada''s destruction was completed by Toxic
    Fallout, whiue Ybivashka claimed top damage, and the capsule was finished off
    by Rose Valora. Top battleship was Pure Alar, top battlecruiser was Roberts Ohioan,
    top cruiser was Super General, most damaging destroyer was Saltrock0000, and most
