- body: 'SEYLLIN 0944 - In what looks like an alarming confirmation of earlier suspicions,
    military authorities just moments ago received a warning of a potential nuclear
    attack underway in Seyllin. The warning came as a delayed-release emergency signal
    from the only ground-level security installation on the planet. Specifically designed
    to withstand the effects of a nuclear blast, the emergency probe escaped into
    orbit just barely, transmitting its message to regional listening posts before
    disappearing off radar.


    Military officials have refused to confirm the attack, stating that various questions
    remain. "We firstly ask that people remain calm during this time. We are seeking
    answers through multiple lines of investigation and will be able to more fully
    report on the situation in a very short amount of time," said the Federation Navy''s
    Emergency Services Manager, Elette Decaix. She added that the distress call alone
    was not conclusive enough to confirm a nuclear attack. "The distress call was
    part of an autonomous early-warning system. The system appears to have activated
    as designed, but there are any number of other environmental events that may have
    triggered the probe launch."'
