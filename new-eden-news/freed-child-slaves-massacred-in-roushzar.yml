- body: A ship carrying several hundred slave children en route to Minmatar space
    was savagely attacked last night in the Roushzar system. The children, all under
    15 years of age, had just been given freedom as part of the FAS program initiated
    by Doriam Kor-Azor and were on their way to relatives in the Republic to start
    a new life. The carrier ship was attacked by at least five heavily armed frigates
    and never stood a chance. There were no survivors. No one has claimed responsibility
    for the act, but paramilitary units loosely connected to the Sarum family have
    been mentioned as likely candidates. National leaders, as well as the CONCORD
    Inner Circle, have released harsh statements denouncing the attack. A spokesman
    for Jamyl Sarum says the heiress lamented the act, but could not condemn the perpetrators
    for 'acting on their beliefs for the good of the Empire.'
