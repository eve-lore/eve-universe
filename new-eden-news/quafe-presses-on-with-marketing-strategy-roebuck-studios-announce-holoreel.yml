- body: "Representatives of Roebuck Studios, one of the largest holoreel production
    houses in the Gallente Federation, today released the first previews of an upcoming
    holoreel slated for premiere in major theaters across the known universe next
    Sunday. This, in itself, is not news \u2013 as one of the more prolific production
    houses in the Federation, Roebuck releases over two hundred holoreels a year.
    The movie\u2019s content, however, is what has reel buffs and cultural pundits
    everywhere turning their heads.   \n  \nDescribed by the studio release notes
    as \u201CA rousing story about life, love, and the things that really matter,\u201D
    the reel, bearing the name \u201CUltra!,\u201D portrays a road trip undertaken
    by four youths -- one Gallenteen, one Amarr, one Caldari and one Matari. From
    the release notes: \u201CThrough their fantastic voyage, the four come to learn
    that things aren\u2019t always what they seem, and that adventure can always lie
    just around the corner.\u201D According to the trailers already released, the
    four youngsters apparently decide to go on their journey after taking their first
    tentative sips of the Quafe Company\u2019s new Quafe Ultra beverage. Cans and
    bottles of Quafe Ultra are featured prominently in the trailer, and as Gallente
    cultural commentator Belle-Marie Jincroix puts it in today\u2019s _Federation
    Tribune_ , \u201Cthe movie\u2019s whole premise seems to rest on Quafe Ultra.\u201D
    \  \n  \nThe holoreel\u2019s trailers have prompted widespread ridicule. Outspoken
    Matari reel critic and columnist Markus Erand writes, \u201CIt\u2019s a classic
    example of the ridiculous depths the lowest common denominator has sunk to. In
    addition to being possibly the most blatantly obvious promotional vehicle in holoreel
    history, it even has the \u201Ctoken Brutor guy\u201D -- no doubt portrayed as
    the same sort of willfully thick-headed ignoramus we\u2019ve come to expect as
    a stereotype from the theatre of idiocy that is the Gallente entertainment business.\u201D
    \  \n  \nThe reel\u2019s director, Gallente first-timer Alanor Smitheen, could
    not be reached for comment."
