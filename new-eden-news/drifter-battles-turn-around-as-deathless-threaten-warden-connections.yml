    Drifter Wormhole Occupiers Resurgent\n\nInside Drifter Wormholes, occupying factions
    have taken advantage of new research insights to unlock greater influence. This
    influence allows them to establish further control over the Drifter wormhole systems.\n\nThanks
    to these insights, all five factions (Amarr Empire, Caldari State, EDENCOM, Minmatar
    Republic, Triglavian Collective) have experienced greater gains from their activities
    within Drifter space. Despite incredible efforts by capsuleers, the early limitations
    of experimental technologies led to losses in influence across the board. Now
    that trend has been reversed.\n\nTriglavian loyalists were the fastest to take
    advantage of the influence changes. They quickly secured control of Azdaja Redoubt
    and have claimed the most victories over Tyrannos Strategos' Dreadnought inside
    their Nexus Point. The Amarr Navy has also experienced great successes, dominating
    Sanctified Vidette. In the Sentinel MZ, EDENCOM has managed to put an end to the
    Vigilant Tyrannos\u2019s control. The Minmatar have also seen significant gains,
    though they still have work some work to do before they can re-establish control
    over Liberated Barbican. While the Caldari are struggling the most in Conflux
    Eyrie, their efforts have begun to bear fruit, and they are on course to re-establish
    themselves.\n\n![Warden close up](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/qRK58zydK13CcU58WvWV2/13457fcbd1cbedd6c6dc6147aa93e6dd/wardenClose.png)\n\n###
    SOCT Suggests Deathless Prepare to Shutdown Warden Connections\n\nThe Society
    of Conscious Thought has shared hyperspace telemetry data showing traffic originating
    at the Warden in Zarzakh and linking to the Drifter wormhole strongholds of all
    five occupying factions. Recent influence improvements have only increased that
    traffic. Furthermore, according to the SOCT, these same links also exist between
    the Warden and Drifter-controlled Nexus Point sites. When asked what connection
    the Warden might have to the Drifter\u2019s sudden advancement of the structures
    within their Nexus after years of dormancy, the SOCT declined to comment.\n\nThe
    Warden was first revealed following the Drifter attempt to attack Deathless-controlled
    Zarzakh. The Deathless Circle has been delivering cryptic warnings since the attack
    on Tabbetzure via hacked Upwell Consortium advertisements. The Scope has been
    unable to communicate directly with the Circle or its representatives, but a communication
    from the Deathless himself was delivered to our offices:\n\n*The Storm has broken.
    Lightning strikes five points, but it is the thunder that you should fear. The
    Hubris of Empires has corrupted our Warden, but not as deeply as the Tyrants'
    grasp. All must be purged for the path to be restored. We toil now to clean this
    mantle of the unworthy. We must freeze the five fingers of Tyranny in place before
    they form a grip around that which is not theirs to claim.*\n\nThe cryptic missive
    was dismissed by Amarr, Minmatar, Caldari and EDENCOM representatives as the rantings
    of a criminal madman. No response has been forthcoming from the Triglavians. Inside
    Zarzakh, there are reports of new scientific teams being assigned to the Warden.
    SOCT CEO Idemi Sver suspects these are attempts by the Deathless Circle to put
    an end to Drifter Wormhole filament access, just as they did on the Harmonics
    gathered from Tabbetzur. SOCT CEO Idmei Sver has however suggested that \u201CWhile
    the people of New Eden did not choose to place their trust in our Society, we
    must now all place our hopes in these forces they have chosen. it is critical
    that firm footholds are established in the Drifter Wormholes before the Deathless
    Circle completes its work, or worse, the Drifters complete theirs.\u201D\n\n###
