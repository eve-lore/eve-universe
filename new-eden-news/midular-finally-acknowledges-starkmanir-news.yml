- body: "Illuin - Minmatar Republic Prime Minister Karin Midular released a statement
    thanking Eifyr & Co. and the Sisters of EVE for \"sharing this breathtaking discovery
    with the universe\" and called for a \"cooperative effort with the Amarr Empire
    to secure their prompt release.\" Her comments caused an immediate firestorm in
    the Republic Parliament, especially among the Brutors, who have long opposed Midular's
    \"appeasement\" foreign policy doctrine with the Amarr Empire. \n\nThe late timing
    of her statement, which comes after Chamberlain Karsoth's near-immediate offer
    of assistance, has infuriated members from all four main parties. Many believe
    that the Amarr Empire, which makes no secret about its reliance on Minmatar slave
    labor, would do little to assist Midular with any kind of recovery effort despite
    Chamberlain Karsoth's pledge to the contrary. \n\nMeanwhile, representatives for
    the Ammatar Consulate continue to deny any advanced knowledge of the Starkmanir's
    survival prior to their discovery by the Sisters of EVE."
