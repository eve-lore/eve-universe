- body: "J200727 - Several eye witnesses have contacted the Scope in the last hour,
    concerned about Sisters of EVE presence in the wormhole systems containing the
    notorious Drifter Hives. \n\nAn SOE flotilla has been sighted in J200727, and
    while this seems an unusual location for SOE operations, this further substantiates
    a report received by the Scope from an anonymous source.  This source claims the
    Drifters have been researching and constructing new, advanced technology within
    their wormhole systems and the SOE have managed to retrieve some of that tech.\n\nWe
    have been unable to obtain an official statement from the SOE, but their continued
    silence on this matter will only fuel the rumor mill.\n\nWe will bring you further
    updates as this story develops."
