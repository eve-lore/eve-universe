    space are grinding to a halt as production managers and entrepreneurs find themselves
    unable or unwilling to acquire the rare minerals required for advanced production,
    specifically megacyte and zydrine. \u201CHistorically, we do this to ourselves
    over and over again,\u201D quoted \u201CHal\u201D, a factory manager in The Forge
    region who did not want his identity published. \u201CMankind discovers a treasure
    trove of natural resources, devours it all at once, and then curses his own misfortune
    when he realizes his cup has run dry and that he should have seen it coming a
    long time ago.\u201D  \n\n\n\u201CWhen megacyte started trading at 14,000 isk
    per unit a couple of weeks ago, I threw in the towel on the ship-building business,\u201D
    Hal explains. \u201CLately the price has backed off of those highs, but megacyte
    and zydrine are still my biggest costs by far, and at these levels there\u2019s
    no way I can compete with the big corporation\u2019s prices, even if my skills
    match theirs on the assembly line. The companies who are actually selling ships
    at low prices while maintaining good margins are the ones who can either operate
    freely in deep space or were smart enough to stockpile the rare stuff long before
    it started trading at these levels. I did neither, and I missed out on the blueprint
    copying bandwagon, so I need to find a new line of work.\u201D  \n\n\nThe cause
    of the shortage is twofold. For one, reports from deep-space miners far beyond
    Empire borders are indicating that megacyte-yielding ores such as bistot and arkonor
    are becoming increasingly rare and that mining sites once abundant with the ores
    have been reduced to pebbles. \u201CYou can thank the big corporations and their
    fleets of strip-mining battleships for that,\u201D grumbled an independent freelancer
    operating in Venal. \u201CThey left the rest of us fighting for scraps. Now we\u2019re
    venturing so far out to get good rocks to mine there that we\u2019re practically
    right up against the edge of the frontier. And then there\u2019s the chore of
    getting it back to a station and then ultimately to the marketplace, all without
    getting blown to bits by the pirates out here.\u201D Asked if she thought the
    price of megacyte or zydrine was inflated, she angrily replied \u201CCry me a
    river about the price of the rare minerals, it doesn\u2019t come close to compensating
    me for what I have to go through every day to get the stuff. We\u2019re totally
    left to fend for ourselves out here, and we get zero help from the same people
    who complain that there isn\u2019t a big enough supply in Empire space. Whatever.
    Talk to me when you\u2019re willing to do something about the situation instead
    of just complaining about it.\u201D  \n\n\nThe second cause of the shortage is
    exactly that: The reluctance of the majority of freelance miners to risk venturing
    deep into unregulated space, at least not without the full financial backing of
    a parent corporation. \u201CTo make the trip worthwhile and efficient, you have
    to move some pretty expensive hardware out there,\u201D quoted an anonymous Apocalypse
    captain operating in the Forge. \u201CThat means getting it all through blockades.
    The advantage always goes to the ambushers, especially when they know where you\u2019re
    going and why you\u2019re there. Sure I could insure everything, but that\u2019s
    not exactly cheap either. The reward simply isn\u2019t worth the risk. I don\u2019t
    care if megacyte starts selling at 20k a unit. Sorry, but I worked too hard for
    this ship just to lose it to pirates.\u201D  \n\n\nSome deep space miners take
    bitter exception to that kind of reasoning. In one extreme sample of that resentment,
    eyewitnesses report that a battleship captain of the \u201CZoners\u201D corporation
    intentionally self-destructed his ship in front of bewildered corpmates as \u201Ca
    show of complete and utter disgust and contempt for those miners who refuse to
    leave empire space because they fear hardship in replacing their own ships.\u201D
    His Megathron was equipped with 7 Miner II lasers and was not insured. The captain
    was said to put on this \u201Cfantastic display of madness\u201D in the hopes
    that \u201Cthis act of insanity and complete disregard for possessions will inspire
    captains who are afraid of losing everything to explore outside of empire space
    in the hunt for new sources of megacyte.\u201D While many from this school of
    thought aren\u2019t willing to go to such lengths to prove their point, they all
    dismiss ship-loss fears as unfounded since Concord offers insurance programs that
    will cover the vast majority of losses. They are also quick to point out what
    in their view is the \u201Cfoolishness\u201D of committing 100 percent of personal
    assets towards a single ship, and that as a general rule \u201Cyou shouldn\u2019t
    be flying anything that you cannot afford to insure.\u201D  \n\n\nIn the end,
    it may be technology that saves the day and jump-starts production lines for the
    smaller manufacturing corporations. Rumors are being leaked from anonymous sources
    within state-sponsored research programs about emerging technologies that will
    enable miners to work more efficiently both inside and out of Empire space. The
    most promising of these is the \u201Cdeep core mining\u201D concept, which will
    supposedly enable trace extractions of rare minerals from common ores that current
    mining laser technology cannot recover. Mobile refinery technology is also rumored
    to be in the advanced stages of development, although analysts predict that the
    technology will require massive amounts of power that existing starship reactors
    cannot supply, and will most likely be introduced alongside an entirely new class
    of ships known as \u201Ctitans\u201D.  \n\n\nSmall and midcap corporations are
    optimistic that the emerging technologies will create new opportunities for them
    to compete more effectively in the marketplace. \u201CHey, expansion and contraction
    are just naturally occurring cycles in the free market,\u201D said Hal. \u201CThings
    will turn our way soon\u2026I hope.\u201D"
