- body: Ratillose - Forces loyal to Amarr Heir Uriam Kador are being routed in what
    is being described as an "epic" counterattack by Federation Navy forces, and are
    reportedly outnumbered by a factor of almost 4:1. The military action follows
    an unprovoked invasion of the Gallente Federation just under an hour ago and emphatically
    described as "unsanctioned" by the Amarr Ministry of War. Scope News has confirmed
    that no Imperial reinforcements have arrived to support Kador's fleet. We will
    continue to update this story as more information becomes available.
