    unreasonable monopolization of mineral resources in high security systems,\u201D
    CONCORD and SCC have announced new regulations designed to prevent these occurrences.
    Speaking from the CONCORD Logistic Support station at Yulai VIII, Moon 10, Tuonainen
    Katagas of CONCORD\u2019s public relations division said, \u201CAfter numerous
    complaints from an array of sources, we have reviewed the situation and determined
    it needed correction.\u201D   \n  \nKatagas said that CONCORD and the SCC began
    collecting data on this subject some time ago, and after careful study determined
    there was enough \u201Cadverse impact on the lives and work of normal citizens\u201D
    to justify a change in the secure container on-board firmware.   \n  \nThe initial
    changes will disable activation of onboard rotation control units that will prevent
    the secure containers from long-term deployment in systems with a CONCORD security
    rating of 0.8 or better. Subsequent changes, which will be broadcast to all existing
    Secure Container units from CONCORD/SCC transmission devices in all standard stargates,
    will de-activate any operational rotation control units in highly secure systems,
    which will destabilize any secure containers currently deployed, resulting in
    their eventual destruction.   \n  \nThe rotation control units, when active, control
    heating and cooling across the outer skin of the secure container by controlling
    dark side-light side exposure, ensuring uniform internal temperatures that stabilize
    the container and prevent radical dimorphic temperature differentials which, unchecked,
    cause the eventual rupture and implosion of the container. The RCUs also act to
    stabilize the container\u2019s position in local space by minimizing drift through
    a series of periodic orientation checks and adjustments against relative position
    to any single or combination of stargates, which broadcast standard navigational
    signals at regular intervals.   \n  \n\u201CWe are making this announcement as
    public as possible in an effort to allow individuals and organizations ample time
    to retrieve any containers currently deployed in highly secure space. After this
    firmware change is finalized and transmitted, any deployed containers will become
    unstable and suffer damage or destruction.\u201D   \n  \nAll newly constructed
    secure containers will receive the firmware revision, and non-deployed cans will
    receive the revision when performing orientation checks subsequent to being launched
    into space but prior to being deployed. They will then transmit failure codes
    to their launching craft, allowing pilots unaware of the CONCORD/SCC change the
    opportunity to recover their containers before they are damaged.   \n  \nWhen
    asked if this change was in response to increased complaints of \u201Cresource
    denial,\u201D or attempts at resource monopolization in national space by miners
    of international origin, Katagas demurred to comment directly. \u201CWe have heard
    complaints from pilots of various nationalities that members of their historic
    adversaries have been engaging in \u2018predatory mining,\u2019 but we have been
    unable to conclusively prove or disprove those allegations. Regardless, these
    changes should address that sort of problem.\u201D   \n  \n\u201CWe are confident,\u201D
    Katagas said at the conclusion of the press conference, \u201Cthat these changes
    will eliminate pollution in our space lanes and afford entrepreneurs the opportunity
    to make a living in harvesting the natural resources available to them without
    having to compete with well-established individuals or organizations rapidly exhausting
    local resources.\u201D"
