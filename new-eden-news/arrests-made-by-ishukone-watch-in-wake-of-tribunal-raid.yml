- body: "Oimmo - In a number of early morning raids, Ishukone Watch tactical teams
    arrested more than 300 Ishukone personnel on charges of aiding piracy and corporate
    corruption throughout the Mito constellation. In addition, Watch officials report
    that 17 suspects were killed while resisting arrest in the operation, the culmination
    of a crackdown on Gurista infiltration of Ishukone offices in Mito.\n\nWitnesses
    stated that Watch special forces executed arrest warrants in Ishukone enclaves
    in both Oimmo and Hakonen almost simultaneously; Watch fleet activity has also
    spiked in support of these operations. On at least one occasion, an Ishukone Watch
    troop transport ship was attacked by Gurista frigates as it attempted to dock
    at an Ishukone-run orbital resort in Oimmo. The frigates were destroyed by a pair
    of Watch Crow-class interceptors that arrived shortly thereafter.\n\nMito, which
    straddles high and low security regions of Lonetrek, has been a center of Gurista
    activity for a number of years. Captain Marko Sandan, leader of the operation,
    said that the Watch investigation had been ongoing for some time. \"Unfortunately,
    due to circumstances beyond our control, the Watch was forced to cut our surveillance
    short and move on the suspects with very little notice,\" he told reporters.\n\n
    \"Of the 351 suspects identified by the Watch investigation, less than fifty escaped
    our raids this morning,\" said Sandan. \"Surveillance was temporarily interrupted
    shortly before the raid, allowing a few of the worst offenders to elude arrest,
    but we are continuing pursuit.\"\n\nThe Watch handed over their full report to
    the Tribunal as the operation began, followed by an abridged version to major
    media outlets after the arrests. Preliminary analysis shows that much of the activity
    the Directorate attributed to treasonous financial activity may have in fact been
    related to Gurista money laundering or other related criminal activities. Final
    determination from the Tribunal should be made within 48 hours."
