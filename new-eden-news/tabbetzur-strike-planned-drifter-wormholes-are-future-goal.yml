    Tabbetzur Strike Plans Leaked\n\nThe first of two military strikes will take place
    on Thursday, the 6th of March in Tabbetzur at 18:00, according to documents leaked
    to the Scope. The documents, which were delivered by an anonymous source, have
    been verified as the incomplete records of a Republic Fleet briefing. The second
    strike is set for 09:00 the following day.\n\nAccording to the hyperspace telemetry
    gathered by the Society of Conscious Thought, these strikes will take place after
    the Drifter intervention in this system has occurred. Yet, according to the briefing,
    the target of the attack will not be under Drifter control. The briefing indicates
    that the goal of the strike will be to retrieve intel that grants an advantage
    in developing the technology necessary to occupy Drifter Wormhole systems.\n\nThe
    Republic Fleet has refused to comment on the operation. Reports from local pilots
    have already suggested hidden presences in the system. While these could be advance
    Republic Fleet operatives, many believe that Deathless Circle operations are underway
    in Tabbetzur. Deathless Circle research outposts have been spotted throughout
    Crisis systems where they conduct dangerous research on Drifter Wormholes.\n\n![Barbican](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/7D5e1h8xkG7TcLMxHAI19A/00be1ebc4ffb7aba303eb0b909f4aa7b/Barbican.png)\n###
    Taking the Fight to the Drifters\n\nSources within all four major militaries have
    reported a shift in focus towards attacking the Drifters' own wormhole systems.
    These systems are believed to be the Drifters' operational hubs. Up until now,
    they have been considered too difficult to hold. This is because of the logistical
    challenges required to set up a significant military presence inside wormhole
    space occupied by hostile forces.\n\nA think tank held on the Paragon station
    in Ourapheh has published findings that contradict those assumptions. According
    to the think tank, the SOCT\u2019s new telemetry as well as remote connections
    demonstrated by the Warden and Fulcrum stations in Zarzakh indicate that new logistical
    possibilities could be unlocked.\n\nThe possibility of opening up this new front
    in the war is not only strategically promising, but would also mean the possibility
    of future research and development. Drifter technology is a largely unexplored
    link to the lost knowledge of the ancient Jove. Any group that successfully secured
    such technology would have a chance to develop future advantages over their competitors.\n\nThe
    Scope has gathered reports of groups interested in advancing towards the Drifter
    Wormholes:\n\n__The Four Major Factions__\n\nIntelligence operatives from the
    four major factions have begun searching for information on how to achieve this
    new technological development. The Republic Security Services, Ministry of Internal
    Order, and Federal Intelligence Office have all made enquires on the behalf of
    their respective governments. In the Caldari State, the House of Records and direct
    representatives of the Central Executive Panel have done the same.\n\n__The Angel
    Cartel__\n\nThe Angel Cartel is known to use Jovian tech as inspiration for their
    unique ships. Recent arrests believed to be tied to the Guardian and Salvation
    Angels indicate a key interest in seizing Drifter technology.\n\n__EDENCOM__\n\nFormed
    to fight against the Triglavian invasion, EDENCOM has recently begun training
    on Sleeper drones instead. Shifting focus from the Triglavians to the Drifters
    could be seen as a natural extension of EDENCOM\u2019s remit. It is believed that
    EDENCOM is collaborating with the DED who would act as a proxy for their interests.\n\n__EverMore__\n\nA
    household name, this corporation\u2019s manifesto is to \u201Cbring all things
    to all people\u201D. EverMore has framed itself as a cutting edge technology developer.
    Their subsidiary Paragon hosted the above-mentioned scientific talks recently,
    and acts as their parent company\u2019s capsuleer liaison group.\n\n__Society
    of Conscious Thought__\n\nThe Society has been vocal in its belief that they should
    be the stewards of Jovian technologies. Through their own corporation and Genolution
    they will likely be glad recipients of any new technologies.\n\n__Triglavian Collective__\n\nThe
    Triglavian Collective is believed to be in the midst of a full-scale conflict
    with the Drifters inside Abyssal Deadspace. All Clades and the Collective itself
    have begun reaching out within Pochven for technologies that would give them an
    advantage over \u201CThe Ancient Enemy Azdaja\u201D.\n\n__The Upwell Consortium__\n\nThe
    Consortium is known for its advanced infrastructure technologies, from megastructures
    to unique cloning techniques. Ytiri, one of the consortium\u2019s member corporations,
    has recently begun making enquiries about Drifter Wormhole technologies on the
    Consortium\u2019s behalf."
