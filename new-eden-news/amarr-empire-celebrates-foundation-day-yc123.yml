    across the Amarr Empire, with Avatar-class Titan battlegroups in parade formation
    in Amarr Prime and the capital systems of the six Royal Houses of the Empire.
    Foundation Day marks the construction of the Grand Basilica of St. Gheinok the
    First Prophet, at the heart of the Imperial City of Dam-Torsad, and is one of
    the most important religious holidays in the Empire's calendar.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/avatar_parade_amarr_prime.png)
    \ \n\n*Above: TES Jamyl the Liberator in \"Imperial Seal\" Parade Formation in
    Amarr Prime*\n\n Empress Catiz I has ordained a week of festivities while emphasizing
    the need for vigilance against \"enemies of Holy Amarr that hide within, as well
    as those who threaten the peace of God from without.\" In light of recent SCC
    tax changes, the Theology Council has declared that additional tithes or offerings
    made on Foundation Day or during the week of festivities will garner the \"special
    favor of Empress and God.\" Capsuleers loyal to the Amarr Empire are also celebrating
    Foundation Day with a traditional [spaceship parade around the Emperor Family
    Station in Amarr system](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/event-foundation-day-yc-123/320593).\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/tetrimon_monastery_thebeka.png)

    Despite crackdowns on dissent and the hunt for heretical cults and terrorist cells
    continuing, celebratory gatherings and movements of religious pilgrims are only
    slightly down as compared to previous years, with number comparable to those seen
    during last year's festival during the Triglavian Invasions. Even so, the various
    security forces of the Empire are maintaining a highly visible presence, and appear
    to be particularly attentive in monitoring the large movements of Imperial subjects
    and foreign tourists typical during such festivities.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/new_traumark_installation.png)
    \ \n\n*Above: New Traumark Installation fortifications in Saminer system*\n\n
    Imperial and House militaries are also continuing to rebuild and redeploy their
    forces as the aftermath of both the Triglavian Invasions and the Equilibrium of
    Mankind terrorist plot settle back into diplomatic contention between the empires.
    The Imperial Navy is reported to have returned the oldest of the so-called \"Mausoleum
    Fleets\" activated at the height of the Invasions to storage and the care of the
    religious orders tasked with maintaining such reserves.\n\n Royal Houses and military
    orders are also notable in having built up their forces and establishing new bases
    and fortifications. The Tash-Murkon Family has followed its development of a stargate
    link into the Stain region with the construction of a new, even more formidable
    fortress at the Traumark Installation in Saminer system. Under Ardishapur Family
    sponsorship, the militant Order of St. Tetrimon has also established a \"fortress
    monastery\" at the fringes of the Thebeka system, scene of a slave rebellion,
    pacification campaign and capsuleer conflict in which the order took an active
    role.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/new_matar_stn_construction.png)
