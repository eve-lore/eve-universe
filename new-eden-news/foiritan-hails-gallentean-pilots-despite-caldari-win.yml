- body: "President Foiritan was today attending the opening of a new Soar Skate Park
    in Caille and used the opportunity to salute the hundreds of Gallentean pilots
    that yesterday participated in gathering body parts for the Federation in a bid
    to gain favor from the Jovians. Foiritan, although not personally involved with
    the affair, showed much interest in it from the start and an indication of this
    was when he listed those pilots most prominent in the collection.   \n  \n\u201CThough
    everyone who participated must be congratulated, especially those that donated
    their parts for the benefit of the Federation, the ones that managed the great
    feats of collecting enough for a whole batch must receive a special mentioning
    for keeping the Gallenteans in the run. I understand, from the information I\u2019ve
    received, that the Gallenteans came in second after the Caldari and were not far
    behind. The Jovians have promised to give out a limited blueprint for each and
    every batch turned in and I think those pilots most committed to keeping the Federation
    strong deserve those blueprints unequivocally.\u201D Foiritan then proceeded to
    name those pilots that turned in one or more batches.   \n  \n\u201CMy heartfelt
    congratulations go out to Maarken Brashari, Faramir, Zhbr, Doc Brown, Drakxter,
    Mervaid, Antonia, Corporal hicks and DocDoo. Each will become a proud owner of
    a new limited blueprint in a couple of weeks, some will even receive more than
    one. Faramir, for instance, will receive a whooping five blueprints for his excellent
    efforts. May those blueprints make those pilots and their companions rich and
    happy.\u201D Foiritan then continued with the opening ceremony, which was by now
    almost totally forgotten by everyone, much to the owner\u2019s chagrin."
