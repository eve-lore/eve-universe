- body: "A savage and ruthless attack on the Khanid Prime shipyards by force of the
    Blood Raider Covenant this week resulted in the theft of more than half a dozen
    of the venerated Navy Issue Apocalypse battleships. This is following reports
    of the blood raiders spying on military convoys and mineral shipments over an
    extended period of time, and in the process building up a network of mysterious
    devices in a grid stretching from Gehi to Khanid Prime itself.   \n  \nWhilst
    the main purpose of these devices is unknown, one side effect appears to be the
    scrambling of Concord and navy sensors and IFF (identify \u2013 friend or foe)
    transmitters. As a result the Khanid navy had no warning of the attack until the
    heavily armed fleet was virtually on top of their shipyards.   \n  \nAlthough
    the Khanid Prime Orbital Defence Network opened fire on the Blood Raider fleet,
    its firepower was insufficient to repel the invaders. Most of the orbital defence
    grid was crippled in the attack - sources inside the Khanid navy report that will
    not be fully operational again for the foreseeable future.   \n  \nFar more worrying,
    however, is the theft of seven partially completed Navy Issue Apocalypse class
    battleships, the pride of both the Amarrian and Khanid navies. As most of the
    remaining construction on these behemoths was superficial, the Blood Raiders now
    have a fleet of these top of the line warships at their disposal.   \n  \n\"We
    are worried about the Blood Raider plans for those ships, and their purpose in
    stealing them,\" a Khanid Colonel reported. \"The Blood Raiders still have several
    functioning fleet construction areas, and it baffles me as to why they'd need
    to steal ships from the Khanid Navy.\"   \n  \nThis is even more confusing following
    the recent string of Blood Raider attacks up that very same corridor just this
    past week. By all accounts capsuleers have destroyed at least nine Bhaalgorn battleships
    and numerous Ashimmu cruisers, which has cost the Convenant hundreds of millions
    of isk. Even for a large organization, that is a significant loss of resources.
    \  \n  \nPilots in the Agil and Khanid Prime systems have been warned to stay
    extra vigilant against Blood Raider ships, and to attack them on sight if sentry
    guns or CONCORD ships do not respond."
