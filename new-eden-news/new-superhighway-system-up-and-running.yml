- body: Under the leadership of CONCORD a new superhighway system has been constructed
    to link distant parts of the empires together. The hub of the new highway system
    is in the Yulai system, the location of the CONCORD Headquarters. From there space
    travelers are in easy reach of every empire region in just 2 or 3 jumps. All systems
    that are part of the highway network have a beefed-up security, so using the highway
    network offers a secure and comfortable way to travel. The superhighway network
    grid is still in its experimental stages, so people are advised to show caution
    while using them. Downtimes and operational failures are to be expected. To compensate,
    using the highway gates will be free of charge until all problems have been ironed
    out.
