- body: "Yulai - At today\u2019s CONCORD Assembly meeting the Amarr Empire representative
    read out an official statement accusing the Republic of \"clandestinely supporting
    the Defiants\u2019 continued terrorist efforts in The Bleak Lands\". The statement
    went on to say that \"Evidence of these Militias emanating from within the Republic\u2019s
    borders is growing daily and the so-called Republic sits there and does nothing.
    If their defense is one of impotence then this only serves to underline the fact
    that the Minmatar are incapable of effective self-governance and would benefit
    greatly from allowing a more experienced government to guide their actions once
    again. The Empire will stand for this naked illegal and expansionist aggression
    no longer and demands that the Republic puts its house in order, or permits others
    to do so for them.\" \n\nThe speech drew much hackling from the Federation and
    Republic delegations, with the Minmatar Republic speaker issuing a short reply.
    \"While we respect the freedom of this assembly to voice their opinions \u2013
    more than most, indeed, as we still remember what it is like to be without voice
    \u2013 we do not appreciate or recognize the validity of the accusations being
    leveled. Investigations are ongoing and this assembly can be assured that all
    available measures are being employed to bring these militias to justice. The
    Republic does not and will not tolerate such behavior from its citizens, from
    within its borders or from without.\""
