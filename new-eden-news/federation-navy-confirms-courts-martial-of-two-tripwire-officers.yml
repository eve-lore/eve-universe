- body: 'ESSENCE - In the wake of the Inner Circle investigation into the Evaulon
    Incident, the Federation Navy has this morning confirmed the courts-martial of
    two senior officers from Tripwire Border Control.


    In a press release made public approximately an hour ago, details have surfaced
    that both Lead Intelligence Analyst Sidere Rualert and Flight Commander Jemes
    Ernois pleaded guilty to charges of negligence, professional misconduct and questionable
    judgment when brought before the Special Department of Internal Investigation.
    Both officers were immediately dishonorably discharged from Federal service after
    16 years and 11 years of service respectively and have subsequently had both their
    military and commercial flight status revoked.


    Shortly after the press release was made public, Thoun Gaterau, Lead Field Agent
    for the Special Department of Internal Investigation, released a statement to
    dispel rumors that the two former service personnel may still face criminal charges
    relating to the loss of life caused during the bombardment of Rilnais. Speaking
    before the assembled interstellar press at Federation Navy headquarters in Algogille,
    he stated that "while the dishonorable discharge of Miss Rualert and Mr Ernois
    has brought their careers with the Federal military to an abrupt halt, the Federal
    Intelligence Office and Senate do not feel it would be prudent to pursue criminal
    charges relating to the loss of life in Evaulon."


    Soon after the statement from the FIO, both former officers were seen leaving
    Federation Navy headquarters under armed SDII guard. Neither of them have been
    available for comment since the hearing concluded.'
