    - Just days after an incident at a Deep Core Mining moon facility in the Kaunokka
    system that claimed the lives of over twenty workers, several of the corporation's
    personnel have come forward to say that the strip mining facilities at the station
    were \"a disaster waiting to happen.\" Calling upon the management to improve
    the working conditions as soon as possible, some miners went as far as to suggest
    the possibility of a strike if their demands are not met.\n\nReita Wotimi, a representative
    of the DCMI miners at the facility, urged the top management of Deep Core Mining
    Inc. to examine the situation and take appropriate measures. \"We have always
    been proud of this facility and of what we achieved here, but in the last few
    months conditions here have become absolutely unbearable. The local management
    tried to ramp up the [mining] by more than half, paying no regard to our safety
    whatsoever. Now we have lost good friends because of their greed.\"\n\nA worker
    who chose to remain anonymous stated that the blast was going to happen sooner
    or later: \"The bigwigs just do not seem to care if we live or die as long we
    crank out the minerals, and it's getting worse every day. Personally, I am not
    going back there, and a lot of people are with me on this.\"\n\nThe corporation
    has not responded to the appeal s as of yet. Meanwhile, two more workers died
    in the intensive care facility today, bringing the total death toll to twenty
    -five."
