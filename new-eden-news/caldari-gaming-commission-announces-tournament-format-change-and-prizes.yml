- body: "During a press conference yesterday afternoon, the CGC announced the prizes
    for the winner and runner ups of the second alliance tournament. The head of the
    commission, Airas Sukela, also stated a change in the tournament\u2019s format.
    The new format is known as a bracket or pool format where contestants are divided
    into eight four-team groups. The first matches are held between alliances of the
    same group and only the top two in each group will proceed to the next round to
    compete against alliances from other groups. \n\nThe prizes that will be awarded
    at the end of the tournament are: \n\n        * First place - 1 x Wyvern Mothership,
    5 x Chimera Carrier, 5 x Caldari Raven Navy Issue \n        * Second place - 5
    x Chimera Carrier, 5 Caldari Raven Navy Issue \n        * third and fourth place
    \u2013 2 x Chimera Carrier \n\nMr. Sukela explained the decision for changing
    the structure of the tournament after the press conference, \u2018 We only had
    28 confirmed alliances willing to participate, and wanting to provide the general
    public with two weekends of entertainment, we decided to change the format to
    extend the tournament period.\u2019 People have come to expect the very best of
    us. I can\u2019t say why so few alliances decided to participate, but we are more
    than happy to accommodate the alliances that have signed up. We still expect this
    tournament to be thrilling to watch, bet on and participate in.\u2019 \n\nFor
    the last weeks many pilots have discussed the tournament through various mediums.
    Seeing a team bragging about their expensive equipment might have discouraged
    smaller contenders from competing. This view is shared by Tyrrax Thorrk, the owner
    of several rare ships, including the Imperial Issue Armageddon and Apocalypse.
    \u2018It seems to me like people who weren't willing to spend the ISK for full
    pirate implant sets simply decided they had lost before signing up.\u2019\n\nProfessor
    Kiyudas Tsalmaki, Lecturer in Emergent Warfare Analysis at the State War Academy,
    has remarked that given the prizes of the first tournament he expected that more
    alliances wished to participate. Mr Tsalmaki: \u2018This can mean two things,
    either the alliances are so rich they do not think it\u2019s worth their time
    to participate, or they can\u2019t afford to lose any ships and don\u2019t participate
    at all. Looking at the list of confirmed alliances, there are some large names
    missing, and we can only guess why they decided not to enter the tournament. Another
    possible explanation would be their preoccupation with other activities, but mostly
    I think it\u2019s a matter of them fearing to lose.'"
