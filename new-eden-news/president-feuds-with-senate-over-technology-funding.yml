- body: "Hardly a week has passed by when the Gallentean government hasn't fallen
    out with itself over some internal issue or other and this past few days the populist
    President elect has again come under fire from the Gallente Senate, this time
    over the thorny issue of funding, and, as ever, it is the central legislative
    body the Supreme Court who are caught in the political crossfire. \n\nAn ardent
    technology buff, President Foiritan has always approached research and technological
    issues with an almost religious fervour and is this time looking to increase government
    grants for the controversial and ultra-secretive Crielere Project, which in the
    two years since it was officially announced is already thought to have soaked
    up over 80,000 billion ISK in tax revenues. \n\n\"Crielere is now very close to
    making a significant breakthrough,\" Announced Jenear Eclere, the Presidential
    Advisor for Science at a press conference held last night. \"But, until we can
    secure further funding to carry out field tests, all an announcement would achieve
    is to inform our enemies what the nature of our work was.\" The President who
    was also in attendance at the media event added: \"If the Senate cannot divert
    funds from the budget then our efforts to improve the lives of the Gallente people
    will have been for nothing. Our only course of action would then be to ask the
    Caldari State for additional monetary contribution to the project, or to close
    the project indefinitely. Neither scenario would sufficiently propel us towards
    the massive advances we stand to achieve.\" \n\nThe Senate meanwhile are adamant
    that the only available funds are those which have been previously allocated for
    the Gallente Business Legion, a State-sponsored fund for retired company directors.
    After a closed and private meeting held late last night to debate the issue, the
    Senate Press Office released a statement this morning which read: \"There are
    men and women who have served the Federation for decades with unswerving loyalty.
    These are the distinguished few who throughout a long career have brought in untold
    billions into our economy. To reward these people with but a minuscule fraction
    of that which they have given us is the least our people can do. Instead our president
    wishes to dishonour our corporate heritage and sink yet more wasted isk into his
    pet science project, a folly that shows no purpose and has thus far shown no results.\"
    \n\nForever stuck in the middle in such rows, the Supreme Court has elected not
    to make a public statement. However, public opinion seems to be going against
    both the Senate and the President on this one issue and commentators are suggesting
    the Court is hoping to use this leverage to push through social reforms in relation
    to immigration and ethnic minorties. \n\n(As a sidenote, this mornings edition
    of the popular satirical magazine 'D\xE9tective Priv\xE9' features on its cover
    caricatures of Senate leaders and President Foiritan shaking fists across a table;
    the Senate waving pension books, the President astride a Titan spacecraft. Meanwhile
    under the table are huddled destitute Minmatar refuges, which, we imagine, may
    or may not be fleeing some future civil war.)"
