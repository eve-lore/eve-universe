- body: "JATARI - The formal surrender of House Miyan to House Darabi has been finalized
    a short while after House Miyan forces were defeated by a House Darabi fleet lead
    by Colonel Faibdash in the Fensi system. \n\nDespite reinforcements arriving on
    both sides, House Darabi held the Fensi system, and forced Holder Touraj Miyan
    to surrender to the attacking forces. In order to stop further bloodshed between
    the two houses, Touraj Miyan surrendered, despite the objections of the leader
    of his forces, Commodore Harkan. Colonel Faibdash accepted the surrender on the
    behalf of Iraj Darabi, who was not present. \n\nFollowing the Kor-Azor Peace Summit,
    House Miyan and House Darabi had managed to agree a temporary cease fire. However,
    recent information released by the Amarr Ministry of Internal Order, which absolved
    House Darabi of the crimes that House Miyan had accused it of fractured the ceasefire.
    House Darabi gathered military forces to strike against House Miyan in the Nebian
    system, a location which was the subject of demands made during the peace talks.
    Colonel Faibdash was assisted by pod pilots Lyzra of Peregrine Guidance Systems
    Inc and Orthensia of 1st Praetorian Guard. \n\nIn the days after the attack in
    Fensi, the Houses of Miyan and Darabi met to discuss the terms of House Miyan's
    surrender. In the resulting agreement, Holder Touraj Miyan is to make a formal
    public apology regarding his comments to Mina Darabi that served as a catalyst
    to the conflict. \n\nIn addition, House Miyan will turn over governing rights
    of the Fensi and Nebian systems to House Darabi, and pay reparations totaling
    over eight billion ISK for losses suffered during the war. As well as the loss
    of territory, House Miyan is also disgraced for it's actions. \n\nHouse Kor-Azor,
    whose territory the original peace talks were held in, and kept out of the conflict
    until now have accepted the surrender deal between the two houses, and have allowed
    House Darabi to control the Fensi and Nebian systems."
