- body: 'Intaki - A month after State Protectorate forces established space superiority
    in the Intaki system, the situation on Intaki Prime itself continues to decline
    slowly, despite the best efforts of the Intaki government. While the protests
    commonly seen on the streets of Intaki cities during the occupation''s first two
    weeks have largely abated, the population remains anxious over the possibility
    of a planetary invasion.


    So far, the planet has been spared food shortages like those experienced by many
    colonies in Verge Vendor. However, the planet has begun to experience some shortages
    of high-tech goods, causing breakdowns and maintenance delays with the planet''s
    transportation and communications infrastructure. These have only intensified
    public concern.


    "I try to go about my daily life like always," said Heneque Tatetur, a mother
    of two who lives in a suburb of the capital. "But I can''t help but think about
    what happened on Caldari Prime and wonder if that is going to happen here. And
    if it does, what will become of us?"


    "The ambiguous state of occupied systems under the CONCORD agreement that created
    the militias is generating a lot of fear," explains Rhin Husel, a senior official
    with the Intaki assembly. "It''s unclear under what circumstances Caldari ground
    forces would be able to invade a heavily populated world, and what such an invasion
    would look like. Federation troops here have been on high alert since the occupation
    began, and the rest of the public can sense the tension."'
