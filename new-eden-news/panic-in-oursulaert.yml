- body: 'OURSULAERT 1002 - Security forces and medical first responders aboard the
    Federation Navy Testing Facilities in orbit around Oursulaert III have responded
    to reports of a deadly stampede in the commercial docking bays.


    Eyewitness reports indicate that the panic was sparked by the news of communications
    failures in the Seyllin system. Passengers waiting in the commercial transportation
    terminal attempted to storm a waiting vessel in order to secure passage out of
    the system. A report from the transportation provider indicates that the vessel
    is currently locked down and secure, a significant number of passengers have been
    injured during the stampede, and the mob is currently refusing to peacefully disperse
    back into the terminal.'
