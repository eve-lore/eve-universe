- body: "After announcing their intentions the previous fortnight, prominent scientists
    Dr. Palask and Dr. Stubbs embarked on the first of many expeditions into a Rogue
    Drone hive last Sunday.   \n  \nAccompanied by several capsule pilots, the researchers
    from the Independent Studies Corporation entered the complex and began making
    scans of the Rogue Drone technology.   \n  \nAfter their would be bodyguards fended
    off several counter attacks from the Rogue Drone infestation, the researchers
    began moving towards the core of the deadspace anomaly to take further scans.
    \  \n  \nThe expedition ran into trouble after exiting the second tier of the
    hive when the ageing accelerator gate they were using malfunctioned, catapulting
    only a few of the survey team into the next tier. Leaving the two scientists and
    their remaining capsuleer escort behind to watch the local communications channels
    in horror as their wayward companions were quickly swarmed and destroyed by the
    fresh wave of Rogue Drones.   \n  \nIn the ensuing chaos and apparent miscommunication
    that followed, the remaining escort became enraged and turned on the unarmed scientists,
    destroying their ships and pod killing Dr. Palask before he could escape with
    his colleague.   \n  \nDr. Palask, who had luckily invested in a clone some weeks
    earlier is said to be recovering from his ordeal at a medical facility on a local
    station. Speaking in a statement today, Dr. Stubbs announced that he and his associate
    would not be swayed by this unfortunate incident and that their research would
    continue."
