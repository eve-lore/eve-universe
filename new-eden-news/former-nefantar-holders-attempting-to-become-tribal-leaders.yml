    of Ammatar who returned to the Republic to reform the Nefantar Tribe were commoners
    in the Mandate. They are now coalescing into the new tribal leadership. Among
    those former Elite who defected, however, are some who believe they should lead
    the tribe's rebirth.  \n  \n\"I was more or less a Holder in the Mandate,\" said
    Rafin Chorda, who was the owner of a large number of slaves during his time in
    the Mandate. \"I know how to organize the masses, how to keep proper account of
    funds and manpower. I have experience in diplomacy and business negotiations.
    I've had to face down Amarrian Holders and Caldari businessmen. I am the right
    man to lead the Nefantar people.\"  \n  \nMany of his fellow Nefantar are distrustful
    of Chorda, however. \"He owned slaves,\" said Domash Kroil, a political opponent.
    \"How can he face the leaders of other tribes? How can they not look down on him?
    The Nefantar would never achieve anything with men like Chorda in charge. We would
    forever be burdened by the dark treachery that those like him perpetrated against
    the Minmatar people.\"  \n  \nChorda is dismissive of such claims. \"I was a kind
    and just master. I was less a master and more of a caretaker. I rescued abused
    slaves and rehabilitated them. I gave them proper care and attention. When the
    time came, I freed them with the help of the Elders.\"  \n  \nOpinions from Chorda's
    former slaves are mixed. \"He wasn't the best master I ever had,\" said one former
    slave of Krusual descent. \"But he wasn't the worst, either. Can't say it'd be
    easy to deal with him on even terms now. Doubt I'd be too fair with him.\"  \n
    \ \nDespite people's generally low opinions of him, Chorda remains confident he
    can rise to the top of the Tribe's ranks. \"I have enough supporters,\" he said,
    \"who know that I will provide the best leadership the Nefantar can ask for. Some
    will always doubt me, but after I show my talents, many doubters will quickly
    come to realize how wrong they were.\""
