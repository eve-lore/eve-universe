    veteran journalist and frontline reporter Ret Gloriaxx has confirmed that certain
    data sites scattered across New Eden and Anoikis can contain the Triglavian transport
    technology known as "Abyssal Filaments".


    Embedded with a Thukker Tribe deep-space raiding party, Ret Gloriaxx has been
    able to witness two separate operations: one against an Angel Cartel fortified
    data site at a classified location in New Eden; another against a Sleeper data
    storage vault deep within Anoikis. Gloriaxx also reports that the Thukker raiding
    party he is embedded in has been challenged by the DED''s SARO forces on at least
    one occasion, but was able to avoid any conflict and withdraw in good order after
    recovering the filament technology.


    Thukker sources indicate that they have been recovering the technology in the
    course of widespread operations in New Eden against various criminal organizations,
    such as the Angel Cartel, Blood Raiders, and Sansha''s Nation. Other raids in
    operations against Sleeper sites have also yielded the "Abyssal Filaments".


    Ret Gloriaxx continues to be embedded with Thukker forces and the Scope will continue
    to report on developments.'
