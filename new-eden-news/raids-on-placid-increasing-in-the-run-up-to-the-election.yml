- body: "Events in the Placid region of Gallente space took a turn for the worse yesterday
    when two Vindicators which appeared to be from the Serpentis fleet entered the
    Ouelletta, destroying several privately owned starships. Following this initial
    attack a valiant attempt by the locals to repel the invaders was made. It failed
    dramatically, however, causing a withdrawl to one of the local stations for all
    those in the defending fleet.   \n  \nAlthough the losses, which included two
    battleships, one cruiser and several smaller ships are minor in comparison to
    losses incurred in other recent pirate activities - such as the raid on Khanid
    space by the Blood Raiders last week - this attack is still seen as a disturbing
    development to the Gallente authorities. A source within the Federal Navy commented
    that \u201Cover the past few weeks Placid and other regions of the Federation
    have seen a dramatic increase in Serpentis activities. Whilst this attack in itself
    was not regarded as a major threat to security, the overall trend is very worrying
    to Federation officials, especially due to the current stability of the political
    climate\u201D.   \n  \nWhilst there is no firm proof on the reason behind these
    attacks, it is widely believe that they are somehow linked to the elections; however
    the Serpentis\u2019 ultimate aim in this campaign against the Federation is still
    completely unknown.   \n  \nUntil this situation has been resolved, the Placid
    authorities urge all pod pilots living in and passing through the region to be
    especially wary when travelling and to report any sightings of Serpentis ships
    to the authorities immediately."
