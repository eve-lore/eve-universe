- body: "Captains of the Amarr Imperial fleet have received notification that they
    are to be \"alert and ready\" today as security measures are stepped up all throughout
    Amarr space. Convoys of ceremonial ships have been seen travelling at the outer
    edges of Empire space today surrounded by large military fleets. In an unfortunate
    incident, a lone miner was detained and later executed for \"suspicious curiosity\u201D
    after contacting passing Imperial Fleet ships and asking, \u201Cwhere they were
    going with all those guns\u201D. Empire spokesmen were unwilling to confirm claims
    of several other incidents similar in nature that have been reported today: \u201CWe
    are simply making sure that today\u2019s sacred event is not disrupted in any
    way. There are many who wish our Empire ill and it is our duty to insure that
    their will is not done.\u201D  \n  \nInvitations to the event have been sent out
    to selected Empire pilots."
