    Metropolis - Thukker Mix CEO, Egar Aldinold, has called on Republic and Tribal
    authorities to crackdown on the Hrada-Oki Caravan following acts of theft. Members
    of the caravan masqueraded as Thukker Mix workers in order to infiltrate a Thukker
    Mix station and stage an illegal convoy. The Hrada-Oki caravan is a Thukker clan
    notorious for its criminal activities and known to be associated with the Deathless
    Circle. \n\nYesterday, a group of Hrada clan members managed to register themselves
    as transport specialists and infiltrate a Thukker Mix Factory in orbit around
    Altrinur XII. Once they infiltrated the station, they stole a variety of items
    stored there, including combat probes, relic analyzers, synthetic synapses, and
    nanoelectrical microprocessors. \n\nEgar Aldinold had condemned the Hrada-Oki
    as \u201Cpetty thieves and disrespectful anarchists who give all law-abiding Thukkers
    a bad name.\u201D She called on both the Republic Security Services and the Republic
    Justice Department to take action against the renegades. She even went as far
    as to suggest that Ennar Aeboul, Chief of the Thukker Tribe, should banish them
    from the tribe. Chief Ennar Aeboul has yet to comment on this suggestion. However,
    sources close to the Thukker leader suggest that he has been seriously considering
    what action the tribe should take against these rebels.\n\nThe Republic Justice
    Department has investigated the Thukker Mix station in Altrinur following the
    Hrada-Oki infiltration. They have informed the Scope that their investigation
    has uncovered evidence that in addition to their theft of valuable items, they
    broke into a sealed containment area within the facility. According to legitimate
    Thukker Mix employees, no one working in the station was even aware that this
    containment area existed. \n\nThe Scope has pulled the original blueprints of
    the station, and the sealed area is not present on them. Thukker construction
    teams have confirmed it was not present when the station was built. RJD agents
    have revealed that there are gaps in the archived security logs relating to the
    maintenance corridor on which this secret area is situated. These gaps date all
    the way back to YC113. Following yesterday's incursion the containment area is
    now unsealed and empty. According to Thukker scientists, the only evidence of
    what was once stored there are anomalous gravity stress fractures on the inside
    walls. \n\nFollowing their heist, the criminal clan formed up outside the station
    with a number of capsuleer accomplices. Due to their Thukker Mix credentials,
    they were not flagged by security forces. They then began moving as a convoy which
    is believed to have been headed toward Zarzakh. A group of Blood Raider hunters
    attempted to attack the convoy in Colelie, but were easily dealt with by the Hrada-Oki
    and their capsuleer escorts.\n\nDespite their initial success, the Hrada-Oki\u2019s
    flight was ultimately doomed. As soon as they left the safety of high-security
    space, however, the convoy was fired upon by capsuleer pilots. All the Hrada-Oki
    ships are believed to have been destroyed in this attack. Following this destruction,
    rumors have begun to surface about the contents of the caravan, including previously
    unseen devices called \u201CAtavum\u201D. According to these unsubstantiated rumors,
    there is evidence that some capsuleers completed the Hrada\u2019s route and delivered
    these Atavum to the Fulcrum in Zarzakh. What the Deathless Cirtcle\u2019s ultimate
    plan is for these mysterious items, however, still remains to be seen.\n\n###
