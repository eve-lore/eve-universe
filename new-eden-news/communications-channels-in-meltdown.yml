- body: "A spokesman for the Chief Executive Panel has admitted that the communications
    network in the Caldari State is under \u2018severe strain\u2019 following the
    news of the disaster at Malkalen.\n\nChannels have been swamped by a massive increase
    in data being transferred across them. Many of the transmissions are from concerned
    relatives and friends; however it is clear that a high proportion of the bandwidth
    is being taken up by The Scope and other independent news agencies.\n\nOfficials
    appealed for calm; \u201CThe system has been operating at peak traffic for a number
    of hours now. We hope people remain calm and wait for press releases through the
    correct channels. The worst thing that the public could do at this time is to
    further endanger an already serious situation by rumour mongers clogging up our
    communications networks with conspiracy theories.\u201D"
