- body: 'Following the recent unscheduled meeting of the Core Complexion board of
    directors, the company yesterday released a public statement of support for Sanmatar
    Shakor.


    "Core Complexion Inc. is a corporation with operations in almost every corner
    of the galaxy. We provide customers from all empires with the product quality
    and low costs that they have come to expect. Despite this, however, Core Complexion
    Inc. is still a Minmatar corporation at heart; we have not forgotten our roots,
    or the common struggles of the Minmatar people.


    "Core Complexion Inc. believes that Sanmatar Shakor has the best interests of
    the Minmatar people at heart, and will work diligently to ensure the freedoms,
    respect, and prosperity that all Minmatar deserve. The success of the Minmatar
    people is a vital component of the success of Core Complexion Inc. We look forward
    to the bright future envisioned by the Sanmatar, as we all work to improve the
    potential of all Minmatar people."


    Core Complexion refused to answer any further questions regarding the statement.
    The announcement was generally well-received, but with the company''s share price
    remaining level, it seems many investors have yet to be convinced. Rumors of a
    pending profit warning from the company, due to rising costs and falling profits,
    continued to swirl in the marketplace. Others questioned the ability of a multinational
    company to function efficiently in a Minmatar Republic that could see a return
    to the preeminence of tribal structures.'
