    Shipyards Manufacturing Center celebrates announcement of Soraya Roden Presidential
    Campaign*\n\n### Soraya Roden Announces Presidential Campaign\nRoden Shipyards
    executive Soraya Roden has announced her candidacy for the Presidency alongside
    her Grandfather, Former President Jacus Roden, during a rally held on Gallente
    Prime. The event was conducted from the legendary Crystal Boulevard in Caille,
    where the Rodens put on an hour-long show filled with performances and speeches.\n\nSoraya
    Roden is the first candidate to officially announce their intention to run. Much
    like her grandfather when he ran, she does not currently hold any political office.
    In addition to her work as a Senior executive, Soraya Roden is the acting head
    of the family\u2019s charitable foundation. Within these roles, she has often
    lobbied the Gallente Senate for business-friendly changes and is a well-known
    figure around the halls of power. \n\nJacus Roden himself took to the stage, introducing
    his granddaughter as \u201Ca born leader, one of my closest advisors, and a great
    source of pride for all our family\u201D. Holding Office from YC112 to YC122,
    the extremely wealthy eccentric Jacus came to power after leading the charge against
    Executive Order 81042, which required private companies to give control over their
    manufacturing to the Federation war effort. Speaking today, Jacus also took the
    opportunity to attack some of the recent rhetoric surrounding welfare proposals,
    such as those backed by rising Senate star Lucas Tenzin. According to the Former
    President, \u201Cpeople need someone like Soraya who can see a path to the light
    ahead, not a hand to hold while they cower in the darkness.\u201D \n\nSoraya arrived
    on stage to chants of \u201CGallente Strength\u201D, a reference to her campaign
    slogan \u201CA Return to Strength.\u201D Her speech focused on an appeal to individual
    freedom and corporate prosperity. Roden criticized a recent \u201Cbacklash against
    corporate excellence, in favor of promoting weakness.\u201D While Roden was quick
    to condemn the Former President Aguard, she called it a \u201Cproblem of Federal
    interference, not industrial ingenuity. Private innovations are the key to our
    dominance over the Caldari threat.\u201D\n\nTrillions are believed to have tuned
    in to watch the live holocast which was sponsored by Quafe. Soraya was also joined
    on stage by her cousin and current CEO of Roden Shipyards, Miloise Roden. Miloise
    said of her cousin, \u201CNo one cares more deeply about the future of this great
    nation. She has always been able to stoke the fires of ambition in everyone she
    speaks with, and I cannot wait to see her do the same for all Gallente.\u201D\n\nThe
    Progressive party, which has plummeted in the polls since Aguard\u2019s impeachment,
    is believed to have reached out to Soraya Roden. Jacus Roden defeated the Progressives
    as an independent when he claimed election victory in YC112, but with the party
    keen to find a new direction, they may just be ready to throw their support behind
    the latest scion of his legacy.\n### News in Brief\n- Gallente militia commanders
