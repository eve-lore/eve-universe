- body: "Amarr Emperor Doriam II has stunned his people by declaring that the notorious
    Tal-Romon Cathedral on Eclipticum will be dismantled piece by piece and moved
    to Amarr Prime, there to be reconstructed on a holy ground on the Amarr continent
    itself. While the shock of Doriam\u2019s decision to seize the cathedral from
    its rightful owner, the heir Catiz Tash-Murkon, is still reverberating through
    the upper echelons of Amarr society these latest news are bound to stir things
    up even further.   \n  \nExperts on Amarrian politics have started reading into
    the signs these news are sending. The move is bound to please the religiously
    faithful, for the honor done to St. Tal-Romon. The move is also seen as an attempt
    by Doriam to distance himself further from his son, silencing the cries of favoritism
    that have haunted him since his inauguration. But what remains to be seen is how
    Catiz Tash-Murkon will respond to this development. While she may be glad that
    her fellow Udorian is being honored in such a manner, this move further undermines
    her authority and guarantees that no compromise solution will be found. The precedent
    has now been set for an Amarr Emperor to impinge upon an heir\u2019s property
    at his whim, something the rich Tash-Murkon family is not likely to take sitting
    down.   \n  \nWork has already started on carefully dismantling the cathedral
    and according to a representative from the Imperial Chancellor overseeing the
    project it\u2019s expected that Amarrian pilots will be recruited in ferrying
    the building to Amarr Prime, as they have already stated their devotion to the
    holy place, probably because St. Tal-Romon is the patron of adventurers and those
    filled with wanderlust. Further information regarding this is to be released in
    the next few days."
