- body: "Kor-Azor Prime \u2013 *** This is a breaking news report *** The Elder fleets
    operating in the Kor-Azor Region of the Amarr Empire and Derelik Region of the
    Ammatar Mandate are retreating towards Minmatar Republic borders. Imperial Navy
    forces are in pursuit and are engaging the attackers wherever they can be caught.
    The wrecks of dozens of capital-class Minmatar vessels have been spotted by Scope
    News camera drones thus far. The general retreat follows the appearance of Jamyl
    Sarum and the unexplained destruction of the third Elder strike force operating
    over the planet Mekhios. \n\nThe resurgence of the former heir, long believed
    dead, is confirmed to be among the pursuing Imperial vessels and appears to have
    inspired the Amarrian counterattack. \n\n_Posted 16:51 GMT_"
