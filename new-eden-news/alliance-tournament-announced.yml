    organizing a second alliance tournament. Scheduled to start on the 15th of July,
    the tournament will be held over two consecutive weekends.\n\nThe first of the
    Alliance Tournaments, held late last December, was a smashing success for the
    Caldari Gaming Commission, now considered leaders in the field. Commission head
    Airas Sukela, speaking on this next round, has been quoted as saying \u201Cthe
    rules of combat haven\u2019t changed much from the first tournament, but with
    the extra time alliances have this time around we\u2019re hoping there will be
    no easy victories. This is not a tournament for the faint of heart.\u201D \n\nThe
    CGC tournament gained popularity among the capsuleer community for its unique
    rule of allowing capsuleer entrants only, a decision that resulted in violent
    and tactical matches between teams whose daily bread and butter is combat. In
    addition, business-savvy capsuleers like Tornsoul, CEO of the BIG Corporation
    and one of the most well-known entrepreneurs of today, took the tournament as
    an opportunity to organise a betting pool for the capsuleer community. The actual
    winnings turned out slim because the favourite, Band of Brothers, ended up taking
    the tournament. However, had Kaos Empire \u2013 the runners-up \u2013 won, anyone
    betting a 100 million on them would have received a payout of about 9 billion.
    Few non-capsuleer sporting events today see these kinds of betting sums. \n\nThe
    general expectations for the second tournament are even higher, as it\u2019s been
    announced well in advance, giving people who wish to participate all the time
    they need to train and prepare. It also allows the bookmakers to organise their
    system. They expect to see more bets and a general higher payoff as a result.
    TornSoul, however, believes that people won\u2019t be guided by numbers only and
    looking to make a fortune. \n\n\u201CPeople bet for two reasons,\u201D she said,
    \u201Cfirstly because they _hope_ the team will win (when the team is made up
    of their own alliance mates or close friends) and secondly because they _think_
    the team will win.\u201D She went on to add that while some people preferred to
    spread the risk, it was \u201Cquite interesting last time when the heavy betters
    were also the 'smart' betters, as they spread out their betting on 3-6 different
    teams.\u201D \n\nThe alliance tournament, in the eyes of many, has taken on more
    importance than anyone would have guessed initially. Professor Kiyudas Tsalmaki,
    Lecturer in Emergent Warfare Analysis at the State War Academy, has stated that
    \u201Cwinning your matches fast and efficiently can determine how organised, lethal
    and merciless your alliance is perceived to be. These are characteristics that
    matter when your enemies are assessing your alliance and gauging your strength.
    To show weakness could result in an invasion.\" If there ever was a place to make
    an impression, it is at this tournament; everyone expects teams to be fitted with
    the best modules money can buy, and several teams have been formed already. \n\nFor
