- body: "Nakugard \u2013 A major arms manufacturing complex located in the Nakugard
    system was today rocked by massive explosions which entirely destroyed one factory
    and damaged another, killing many workers. The destroyed factory produced depleted
    uranium shells for battleship class cannons and significant damage was also inflicted
    on a light autocannon facility in the same complex. Initial reports are that approximately
    100 workers have been killed, though there are fears the death toll may rise.
    Investigators are indicating that they believe this was a deliberate act of sabotage
    rather than any kind of industrial accident, based primarily on the regular pattern
    and widespread nature of the explosions.\n\nOperated by the Krusual Tribe as part
    of their considerable holdings in Nakugard system, the arms manufacturing complex
    is known to have been a significant supplier of armaments and ammunition to both
    the Republic Navy and the Krusual Tribe's own militia. The Krusual recently declined
    to supply the Brutor Tribe with armaments from this facility, leading some to
    speculate that the sabotage may have been carried out by radical elements among
    the Brutor.\n\nThe Brutor Tribe has angrily dismissed the suggestion that a failed
    trade negotiation would lead them to kill fellow Minmatar as 'grossly insulting'.
    One anonymous Brutor source went so far as to say that, \"We shall consider anyone
    giving voice to these baseless accusations as having infringed on the honour of
    the Tribe and take steps to satisfy that honour.\" The Krusual Tribe itself has
    refrained from commenting but moved large numbers of warships and militia into
    Nakugard and surrounding systems within hours of the catastrophe.\n\nInvestigators
    are refusing to comment other than to confirm that they believe the explosions
    are the result of sabotage. Numerous police, customs and military officers are
    co-ordinating in a concentrated effort to question surviving employees and gather
    evidence in the vicinity. Emergency workers continue to search through the ruined
    factories for survivors, though there is a grim expectation that more dead will
    be discovered. Hospital facilities in Nakugard are coping with the influx of dozens
    of wounded, while support staff and equipment are being rushed from surrounding
    systems.\n\nTensions remain high in the Nakugard system and local Republic forces
    are on full alert as the hunt for the saboteurs continues."
