- body: "The Sisters of EVE this morning made a public plea to the Amarrian council
    to be allowed into Mabnen and the other systems which were seeded by the Blood
    Raiders to provide critically needed aid to the casualties of the uprisings in
    those systems.   \n  \nSpeaking on behalf of the entire organisation, Santimona
    Sarpati, the CEO of the sisters of EVE spoke of the terrific numbers of casualties
    in these systems which they were being denied access to. They went on to say that
    if they were not allowed to assist the planetary medical facilities then far more
    people will die than would otherwise. \u201CPlanetary infrastructures simply aren\u2019t
    designed to cope with the casualties which come from conflicts on this scale.
    People will die needlessly if we aren\u2019t allowed to help.\u201D   \n  \nRejecting
    aid from the Sisters of EVE is an unprecedented move by the Amarrian council.
    They have before provided aid to all of the major empires at some point during
    their history and many believe that this will set a dangerous future precedent
    which could result in millions, if not billions of wasted lives.   \n  \nFollowing
    this announcement the Gallente Senate announced their support for the Sisters
    of EVEs plea, urging the council to lift their blockades and allow them into the
    conflict zones. There has been no word from the council since their emergency
    session started just after the conflicts began and it looks like the session may
    not end soon. The council it seems, has more on its mind than providing aid to
    those affected."
