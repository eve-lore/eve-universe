    Jacus Roden formally assumed office earlier today at his inauguration before the
    Gallente Senate. Shortly beforehand, incumbent President Souro Foiritan made a
    brief, formal statement to the Senate. Executive power rested briefly with the
    Senate before Chief Justice Broyal Alserette of the Federation Supreme Court swore
    in Jacus Roden as the new President of the Federation.\n\nTo a standing ovation,
    President Roden then took the rostrum and stood quietly for a moment before motioning
    for silence and giving a speech in which he reaffirmed his election pledges. President
    Roden stated that it was the policy of his government to \"restore Federation
    control over the space and planets of the Luminaire system and to all Federation
    systems and worlds occupied by Caldari State naval and militia forces,\" and noted
    that capsuleer forces of the Federal Defence Union had liberated several Gallente
    systems since the election. His wide-ranging speech took in aspects of policy
    such as corruption - another theme of Roden's campaign - industrial policy, and
    the importance of the capsuleer class to the economy and security of the Federation.
    President Roden is himself a capsuleer.\n\nPresident Roden finished his speech
    with a pledge \"to return the Gallente Federation to the greatness that has been
    its undoubted destiny from the moment our peoples united to realize the historic
    project of universal freedom.\" As he stepped back from the podium, the Senate
    once more erupted in a standing ovation, which the President acknowledged before
    leaving."
