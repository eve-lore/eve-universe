- body: "A few days ago Ascendant Frontier (ASCN) forces, on behalf of the Angel Cartel,
    destroyed a Sansha's Nation exploratory force in TR07-S. Sansha's Nation forces,
    commanded by Frazier Eachann, attempted to establish a foothold in the area using
    a Mobile Starbase structure as a forward base. \n\nTheir forces consisted of 3
    Revelation-class Dreadnoughts and 24 Nightmare-class Battleships. These ships
    moved into TR07-S and proceeded to deploy an Starbase near a moon in the system.
    They were met on the battlefield by an equally impressive ASCN force, which Ascendant
    forces included 4 Dreadnought-class vessels. The Archangels fielded a Naglfar-class
    Dreadnought, to aid their allies. \n\nThe ASCN forces marshalled nearby, an hour
    after the call had gone out. Their fleet of 164 waited for the order to attack.
    With an initial positioning of the ASCN fleet 400km above the well-armed Starbase,
    they soon warped into point blank combat range and fierce barrages between the
    two opposing fleets commenced. Initially Sansha's took the upper hand, but Ascendant's
    sheer force of numbers turned the tide of the battle, resulting in total loss
    for the Sansha's fleet. The final toll for Ascendant was 2 Amarr-class Dreadnoughts
    and approximately 20 battleships. With the field cleared of hostile ships the
    Ascendant fleet turned its attention to clearing the POS structure removing the
    last evidence of Sansha's presence. \n\nThe Cartel diplomat Xavier Khun has been
    previously spotted with the Ascendant Frontier alliance. Rumour has it that the
    two forces have been involved with each other for the past two months. Previous
    Cartel/Ascendant co-operations have not been publicly acknowledged until now,
    the appearance of Xavier Khun himself as pilot of a Naglfar dreadnaught in the
    strike-force confirming the relationship between the Angel Cartel and ASCN.\n\nWith
    the improving relations between the Ascendant Frontier alliance and Angel Cartel
    it seems the Angel Cartel felt it would be an opportunity for Ascendant to prove
    their friendship. Leader of Ascendant Cyvok had this to say, \"ASCN has committed
    itself to helping the Cartel whenever we are called upon or given information\".
    Speaking to Cyvok after the monumental battle, he had this to say, \"This was
    a real opportunity to show our worth to the Cartel and earn some respect on the
    battlefield from both the Cartel and Sansha.\" \n\nThe implacable remnants of
    the Nation were characteristically silent, despite numerous attempts to get their
    comments on the battle, or their move into the Cartel\u2019s territory."
