- body: "A multiracial force of hundreds of pilots intercepted Guristas warships bent
    on storming the Crielere research labs and successfully drove them out of the
    Crielere system. Crielere co-founder Henric Touvolle applauded the efforts of
    this brave group, whose losses were considerable. Escape pods could be seen glittering
    amidst the debris and ravaged hulls of frigates, cruisers and battleships. Scavengers
    collected weapons and modules lost by the merciless Guristas as their forces slowly
    dissolved.   \n  \nThis military success is considered somewhat an embarrassment
    for the Caldari and Gallente fleets, as they had just abandoned the system a few
    hours before the combat began. The skeleton crew of Crielere was certain that
    these would be their last moments when Guristas battleships started pounding their
    defenses. Cries of joy and elation could be heard broadcast from the compound
    once it became obvious that the pirates had given up and began retreating. A ray
    of light seems to have shone through the darkness that has until now seemed to
    engulf this visionary project."
