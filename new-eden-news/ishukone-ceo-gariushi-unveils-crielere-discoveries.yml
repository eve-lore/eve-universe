- body: "Otro Gariushi, CEO of Ishukone has announced that recent discoveries made
    at the ultra secret Crielere labs are to made freely available to the public.
    \  \n  \nLead scientists at Crielere labs today published a detailed white paper
    describing possible manufacturing methods using a relatively unknown mineral named
    morphite. Driven by advances in deep core mining, the team has found an economically
    feasible method of using the mineral, found in mercoxit ore, for mass production.
    Research agents throughout the known universe are sure to make use of the information
    given by the science team, to the surprise of many, as it was not expected that
    the two main funding partners of the Crielere research project, the Caldari State
    and Gallente Federation, would give their research results out that freely.   \n
    \ \nPolitical analysts have been at a loss to explain why the usually secretive
    CEO is suddenly so keen to share knowledge with the rest of the world. Skeptics
    claimed that Gariushi is hyping up this invaluable mineral as he intends to profit
    from the manufacture of deep core mining lasers, known for their below average
    performance in mining standard ores."
