- body: "Sad news have arrived from the Royal Mines at the planet of Inis-Ilix I as
    the bodies of the two missing scientists Henric Touvolle and Taromi Umailen were
    discovered near a small cave on the outskirts of one of the slave camps. It was
    a team of professional bounty hunters, hired by the Federation, which tracked
    down the scientists' whereabouts, but arrived too late to have a chance of reviving
    them. Tentative inspection suggests that malnutrition and respiration problems
    may be the cause of death, though authorities refrain from any further comments
    until after an autopsy. The toxic atmosphere of Inis-Ilix I claims the lives of
    hundreds of slaves each week, sparing only those whose stamina has been hardened
    through years of survival in brutal conditions.  \n  \nThe science community is
    shaken by the loss of its brightest beacons and memorial services are being held
    today all over the world of EVE in respect of these giants of modern science,
    responsible for bringing many wondrous discoveries into the world.   \n  \nIn
    related news the Amarrians are claiming the two Minmatars that stole the identities
    of the two scientists and replaced them in Articio Kor-Azor's new research labs
    were in fact rebel infiltrators intending to sabotage the laboratories. After
    the pair left with the help of federal escort it was discovered that sensitive
    information, including blueprints for rare Amarrian space vessels, was missing
    from the research facilities. The Amarrians are demanding that the two Minmatars
    be returned to Amarr space immediately, but the pair vanished after entering Federation
    space and is not likely to be seen again. Sources say that Articio is fuming over
    the whole escapade and is plotting to avenge this affront to his honor."
