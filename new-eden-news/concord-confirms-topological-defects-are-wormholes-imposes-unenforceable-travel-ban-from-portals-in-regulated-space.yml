    earlier by the Sisters of EVE have begun appearing throughout the New Eden cluster.
    The wormholes are reported to be structurally stable enough to traverse, although
    they cannot predict the duration that they will remain open.   \n  \nIn addition,
    CONCORD has stated that they can only protect those who enter or leave from portals
    within hisec space, and have thus declared an \"unenforceable travel ban\" in
    an attempt to discourage pilots from entering.   \n  \nRumors have begun circulating
    that probes sent through wormholes can maintain contact with their deployment
    platform, but cannot determine their location on the far side."
