- body: "The public elections where the citizens of the Federation vote on whether
    president Souro Foiritan can run again in two years time started yesterday. Political
    analysts had predicted a very low turnout, but first indications show otherwise.
    With the elections still only in their second day the turnout is already almost
    20%, with three days still remaining.   \n  \nThe media is forbidden from making
    actual polls with the elections ongoing, but a few unofficial polls have been
    circulating. Again the analysts have been proven wrong, a strong turnout was thought
    to strengthen the president's cause, but the opposite seems to be true. Though
    the numbers are sketchy at the moment, only 40-45% of voters are supporting Foiritan.
    Spokesman for the president, Endt Strovare, declined to comment on these unofficial
    polls, apart from pointing out that in the presidential elections three years
    ago, Foiritan came from behind to narrowly win in the last couple of days. Although
    Strovare didn't go so far as to predict the same would happen now, he strongly
    hinted that this might be the case."
