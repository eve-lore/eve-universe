- body: "Since noon today, hundreds of starship pilots have reported finding a previously
    unseen form of weaponry in their hangars, along with a stack of gigantic snowballs.
    The weapon resembles a standard missile bay, except for the distinguishing fact
    that it seems to have been retro-fitted in order to accommodate the snowballs
    in question.  Much general bafflement has been expressed at the appearance of
    these mysterious weapons, with most pilots unable to comprehend how they have
    come to be in their hangars. A few scholars have suggested that the occurrence
    may be in some way linked to an ancient old-earth festival believed to have been
    held this time of year, in which gifts were supposedly exchanged and people encouraged
    to come together in the spirit of festive cheer and joy. Others have scoffed at
    this, stating that \u2018Yooltie,\u2019 as it is known in the history books, is
    but a myth.  Whatever the case may be, pilots all over the universe today find
    themselves in possession of these strange weapons. More on this development as
    it unfolds."
