- body: "Innovaatio Varustukset, a small independent military development company,
    has found itself at the centre of an intense bidding war between the Caldari MegaCorps.
    \n\nThe corporation, founded a decade ago by current CEO Markku Samuli, is unusual
    amongst Caldari entities in that it is entirely privately owned and run, without
    any connection to the larger Caldari MegaCorps. Whilst such approaches are traditionally
    a disadvantage in the ruthless economic battlegrounds of the State, the company's
    innovative and unorthodox work environment, along with the hard work of Samuli
    himself, has allowed the corporation to flourish and earn a reputation many times
    it\u2019s size. \n\nMuch of Innovaatio's success stems from several development
    contracts with the Caldari Navy, allowing the corporation to turn a sizeable profit
    at a time of economic recession in the majority of the State. This, along with
    rumours of cutting edge research in several sectors, has spurred the MegaCorps
    into a vicious bidding war for the company.   \nIshukone, Lai Dai and Nugoeihuvi
    are believed to be making the front running in the current round of bids.\n\n\"It's
    a dream come true,\" said Samuli at the press conference announcing the impending
    sale. \"I started this company with hopes of earning enough to send my children
    to a good school. Now, I'll be able to send my children's children's children
    to a good school as well.\" \n\nSamuli declined to comment on an exact figure
    of the amount of ISK being offered, but estimates place the worth of the company
    at over 50 billion ISK in raw assets alone. Analysts expect the bids are entering
    the area of 400 billion ISK, a sizeable amount for a corporation the size of Innovaatio
    Varustukset, with a final total that many observers believe will exceed this easily.
    \n\n\"Every time one number gets sent in, someone else sends in a bigger number,\"
    Samuli said. \"I can't imagine the bidding will continue for much longer. Eventually,
    someone will offer a number I don't think can be topped.\" \n\nSome parties are
    questioning the size of the bids, however. \"The company has succeeded thus far
    by being apart from the MegaCorp structure,\" said Hugues Jasmin, a Gallente analyst
    who has focused his research on the economics of the Caldari State. \"The MegaCorps
    are unlikely to maintain the talent, atmosphere, and work environment that has
    allowed Innovaatio Varustukset to thrive. They're taking a huge risk.\" \n\nMost
    analysts, nonetheless, dismiss such worries. \"With the weight of a Lai Dai or
    Ishukone behind it, the company can focus more on the research and less on the
    economic and administrative,\" said Sindri Hinrik, head of the Economics department
    at Science and Trade Institute. \"It should be mutually beneficial to everyone
    involved.\" \n\nInsiders expect a deal to be announced within the next week which
    prompted shares in the company to rise 11% in 24 hours."
