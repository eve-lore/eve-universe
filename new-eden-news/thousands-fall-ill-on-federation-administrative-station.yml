- body: 'Dastryns - Health officials from the Federation Administration Bureau Offices
    located in the Dastryns system are reporting an outbreak of illness among the
    station management and VIPs. Station services and general staffing have not been
    affected, and Gallente officials emphasized that neither station nor system security
    are affected by the outbreak.


    Station medical experts have been unable to isolate the cause of the illness;
    the affliction has some similarities to known bacterial infections. Symptoms of
    the illness include extreme sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, and dizziness.
    Antibiotic treatment has been ineffective, though treatment of the symptoms has
    been reported as successful.


    An estimated 6500 individuals have been affected, but station officials are quick
    to note that only a fraction of those individuals are considered "at risk." Station
    residents and visitors are being asked to remain calm, and medical officials have
    asked for anyone to visit the nearest clinic if they experience any of the listed
    symptoms.'
