    Emotions ran high today as the Gallente Senate debated a bill which would have
    major implications for the Federation's defense communications network. At issue
    was the bill's plan to undertake a massive upgrade of the physical infrastructure,
    encryption protocols, and anti-tamper safeguards underpinning all secure defense-related
    communications.\n\nThe plan is the result of a recent study undertaken by the
    Federal Intelligence Office's Special Department of Internal Investigations to
    assess communications vulnerabilities that might compromise Gallentean national
    security. Though the details of the report remain classified, the military's comm-network
    was identified as containing a number of such potential weak spots.\n\nBut opposition
    to the bill was strident largely due to its contract awards plan; the funds are
    to be spent on a handful of corporations pre-approved in the FIO study, with Allied
    SecureComm acting as the prime contractor. While such no-bid contracts are somewhat
    common in government spending, the scope of the work in this proposal drew objections.
    \"Allied SecureComm is getting this job only because they're based in Blaque's
    home district,\" said Julian Hevard, a journeyman Senator from one of Everyshore's
    more populous districts. \"This is largesse politics, plain and simple. Has anyone
    else noticed that it was an FIO study that put this plan into motion?\"\n\nSupporters
    of the plan rallied to its defense, however. Senator Faron Shu, chairman of the
    Defense Appropriations Subcommittee that brought the bill before the Senate, said,
    \"Without going into classified details, I assure you that the need for these
    upgrades is necessary and vital.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he believed Caldari forces
    could have exploited these vulnerabilities during their recent seizure of a number
    of Gallente frontier systems, Senator Shu declined to comment.\n\nThough debate
    was heated, in the final vote the measure passed by a comfortable margin."
