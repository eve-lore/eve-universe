- body: "Last weekend emissaries of the Caldari State and the Gallente Federation
    gathered at the Crielere Research Laboratories to confer about the future and
    direction of their joint research project, estimated to have cost the two governments
    in excess of 100 billion ISK in the relatively short period of time since its
    instatement. Jorouette Duvolle and Otro Gariushi (CEOs of Duvolle Laboratories
    and the Ishukone Corporation, respectively) played host to attendees, which numbered
    many high-ranking dignitaries from the halls of Caldari and Gallente government
    -- though perhaps none quite so high-ranking as the Gallente President himself,
    Souro Foiritan.  \n  \nFoiritan, who had not been scheduled to attend the conference,
    arrived unexpectedly during the second hour of the proceedings and reportedly
    began by undertaking a three-hour-long tour through the laboratories without a
    word of greeting to his political colleagues. As the emissaries conferred in closed
    chambers above him Foiritan traversed the facilities, sharing easy banter with
    scientists and research assistants, apparently taking great personal interest
    in every piece of technology he encountered.   \n  \n\"It was amazing,\" said
    assistant engineer Karel Flaviane. \"One minute I'm sitting there tying up wire
    bundles on a prototype cargo scanner, and next thing I know the most powerful
    man in the Gallente Federation is staring at my fingers asking how it's going,
    like I'm solving a crossword puzzle or something. I mean, that just doesn't happen
    every day.\"  \n  \n\"He was so nice, too, and genuinely enthusiastic \u2013 not,
    you know, not like you'd expect a President to be at all,\" added Flaviane.  \n
    \ \nAt the conclusion of his impromptu tour Foiritan made his way to the conference
    chambers, where he delivered a rousing speech on what he described as the \"limitless
    possibilities of the work being done here by this amazingly talented coalition
    of scientists.\" He concluded his ten-minute speech by stating that were anything
    done to stifle this project, it would \"close the door to the future instead of
    allowing us to walk through it, heads held high, into a new age of technology.\"
    \ \n  \nSenate officials from within the Gallente government immediately rushed
    to comment on Foiritan's behavior, denouncing it as a \"deliberate, and quite
    frankly rather pathetic, ploy to garner public support by playing himself as the
    people's man.\"  \n  \nIf the President's behavior was indeed a ploy, it seems
    to have worked; latest polls indicate that among the Gallente populace, support
    for the Crielere project has skyrocketed to an all-time high. Caldari officials,
    meanwhile, remain as tight-lipped and cryptic as ever, refusing to comment on
    their stance towards either the President's behavior or the research facility
    itself. At the conference's conclusion, when asked whether further talks were
    scheduled, Mr. Gariushi of the Ishukone Corporation refused to comment.   \n  \nIn
    any case, as the scientific work proceeds and the billions pile up, one thing
    seems certain: the pressure on Crielere is steadily increasing, and the day of
    final judgment for this project \u2013 be it thumbs up or thumbs down \u2013 cannot
    be far off."
