- body: "Republic Navy Operations Command yesterday reported Ishukone Watch patrols
    making incursions into Minmatar-controlled territories, performing unsolicited
    ship scans and questioning passers-by on closed frequencies. This is the sixth
    time in the last two weeks that Ishukone forces have been seen in the area. Border
    systems Todrir and Eust have both played host to ships from the privately-controlled
    police force, resulting in stepped-up patrols from Republic Navy forces in the
    vicinity.   \n  \nAccording to Republic Navy spokesman Raurvest Arrum Caldari
    private police forces have traditionally stayed out of areas belonging to neighboring
    nations. Inquiries as to the nature of these recent incursions have been met with
    silence on the part of the Ishukone corporation, with diplomatic circles yielding
    no satisfactory response either.   \n  \n\u201CWe\u2019re unsure where exactly
    their motivations lie,\u201D said Arrum. \u201CThey\u2019ve been seen here six
    times now, scanning ships and questioning bystanders, and they never give any
    explanation as to what they\u2019re doing.\u201D Reports from those questioned
    have indicated the Ishukone Watch are particularly interested in shuttle traffic
    from Caldari space into Matari space, but no concrete information beyond that
    has been revealed.   \n  \nIshukone Watch ships were also last month seen in Kaalakiota-controlled
    territories, leading many to speculate whether hostilities were on the rise between
    the two corps."
