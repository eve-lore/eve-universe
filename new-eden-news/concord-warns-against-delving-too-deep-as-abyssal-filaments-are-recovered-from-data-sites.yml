- body: 'YULAI - CONCORD''s Commander Vex Amita has issued a warning to capsuleers
    against "delving too deep in Abyssal Deadspace" on pain of suspect flagging for
    those reaching the "far depths of this dangerous and existentially threatening
    domain".


    As reports of capsuleers acquiring "Abyssal Filaments" and entering abyssal deadspace
    have continued to come in, CONCORD officials held a press conference to declare
    broad support for "limited exploration of the Triglavian domain" while cautioning
    that those entering abyssal pockets designated "Tier 4 or 5", also codenamed "Raging"
    or "Chaotic", will be flagged as suspects on emerging from the Abyss.


    Fleet Captain Oveg Drust of the DED''s Genesis Fleet confirmed that this measure
    had been enacted due to the "existential threat posed by the increased risks of
    subversion and suborning of capsuleers operating in such locations by the Triglavian
    Collective, who we continue to consider a clear and present danger to the people
    of New Eden".


    Commander Amita and Fleet Captain Drust both declined to comment on the matter
    of the recently recovered Triglavian ship or claims of CONCORD agency "black ops".


    The Scope will continue to report on this developing situation.'
