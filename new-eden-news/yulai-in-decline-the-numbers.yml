- body: "In light of the decline in trades in the former trade center Yulai, the Secure
    Commerce Commission released figures today supporting the view that Yulai is on
    its last legs. Three months ago, on the fifth of Juli, Yulai numbered 8067 trades
    for the day. Two weeks ago, the total number of trades was recorded at 3020, a
    decline of 62.56 percent.   \n  \nComparing that to the emerging trade hub Oursulaert,
    which numbered 8340 transactions on the fifth of juli, the sevent saw a staggering
    increase 150.50%. 12552 trades were registered september the fourth.Other remarkable
    increases were noted in Agil, where transactions per day increased by 148.25%.
    Amarr, crown of the Empire, saw a phenomenal increase of 171.45%. Oddly, Jita
    remained around the same level of transactions per day.   \n  \nSCC Chief Executive
    Officer and presidential candidate Eman Autrech stated: \"The decicion to re-route
    certain gates was not taken lightly. Although we knew that it would result in
    some decline of trade to Yulai, we did not expect the market to crash this much.
    \  \n  \nThe SCC is, however, elated to note that replacement hubs are already
    forming in the Caldari State and the Amarr Empire. Goods follow the path that
    takes them to the customer quickest and it is interesting to see the new trade
    and transaction patterns form. The Secure Commerce Commission will keep watching
    and protecting the market, regardless of where it concentrates.\"   \n  \nAlthough
    we were not able to gather all the SCC data, it was sufficient to note a large
    increase in the Caldari \u2013 Amarr centered trades. Whatever happens to Yulai,
    it appears that the changes to counter smuggling in the Federation and Republic
    have benefitted the Amarrians and Caldari the most."
