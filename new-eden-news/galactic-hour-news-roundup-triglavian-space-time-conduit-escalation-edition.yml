    news from around New Eden as the Triglavian Collective escalates its operations
    to establish persistent conduits through space-time from the depths of Abyssal
    Deadspace into K-space itself.\n\n**New Triglavian Strategy Emerges As Collective
    Establishes \"Minor Conduits\"**\n\nYulai, Genesis - A new phase in the Triglavian
    invasion has developed in the last few days, with it becoming clear that the appearance
    of sites of space-time distortion across invasion zones is an effort to establish
    persistent \"conduits\" from Abyssal Deadspace into New Eden's known space. Triglavian
    [messages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8Ltgk6rdVs) heralding the appearance
    of the conduits were received by a number of capsuleers. CONCORD has designated
    the sites as \"Minor Conduit\" locations but the Triglavian Collective are maintaining
    significant forces at these sites, while continuing to roam across the systems
    within the invasion zones.\n\nIn an apparent change of strategy, the current invasion
    zones centered on Charmerout, Elonaya and Esescama have persisted for two days
    so far with no sign that the Triglavians intend to retreat as they generally did
    within 24 hours with their previous roaming scout operations. CONCORD sources
    continue to maintain that a strategy of \"containment and defeat in detail\" is
    the best method of combating the Triglavian threat. The Empires are continuing
    to establish co-operation protocols and a summit meeting hosted by the SoCt in
    FDZ4-A is continuing. Star Marshal Kjersidur Elladall of the DED continues to
    co-ordinate CONCORD response efforts in space, with Provost Marshal Kasiha Valkanir
    of AEGIS responsible for planetary and installation defense operations.\n\n**Sansha
    's Nation Launch Incursion in Fabas Constellation; Widespread Landings in Nasreri
    System**\n\nNasreri, Genesis - New Sansha's Nation incursion operations in the
    Fabas constellation have included major landings on the third and fourth planets
    of the Nasreri system. Reports indicate that major cities and colonies on those
    planets have been raided by True Slave forces and large numbers of people have
    been carried off in Sansha's Nation vessels. Civil defense has been overwhelmed
    in the face of what appears to be an opportunistic attack while CONCORD and Amarr
    forces redeploy in response to Triglavaian invasion fleet movements.\n\nThere
    are growing fears that the colonies and settlements of Ebasez system will soon
    be raided by Nation forces seeking more people to convert into True Slaves. The
    third and fifth planets of Ebasez are in a state of panic, while the underground
    mining colonies of Ebasev IV have apparently gone into lockdown and cut off all
    communications with the outside world.\n\nAnalysts believe the large population
    raiding parties, significantly larger than seen in recent Nation incursions, are
    geared towards building up Sansha's Nation forces in light of apparent Triglavian
    hostility to the cybernetic dictatorship of Sansha Kuvakei. The scale of the planetary
    raiding suggests that Nation strategy has decided to focus on massive raids of
    populated locations, concentrating their slave ships in the effort.\n\n**Blood
    Raider Attack on Matar Staged from FOBs in Evannater Constellation; Atgur Mining
    Operations Also Raided**\n\nMatar, Pator  - The coast of Mikramurka on Matar has
    been struck by a vicious assault by the Blood Raider Covenant, with the seaport
    of Sundsele especially badly hit according to reports. The Blood Raider strike
    force is believed to have staged out of forward operating bases in the Evannater
    constellation. Mining installations in the Atgur system have also been struck
    by the Blood Raiders, with the cultist pirates apparently taking advantage of
    mobilization and redeployment movements of local Republic Fleet elements.\n\nThe
    coastal zone of the Mikramurka continent is reported to have been saturated with
    \"Deathglow\" missiles, particularly at key locations such as the bustling and
    popular seaport and resort of Sundsele. Casualty reports are suggesting several
    thousand dead and injured at least. Unconfirmed reports indicate the Blood Raiders
    took a number of people captive. It is unclear what the motive for this assault
    could be, although there is some suggestion that the Raiders, like Sansha's Nation
    may be trying to bolster their numbers. If reports that the Raiders were primarily
    targeting teenage children are accurate, this is a sinister and tragic twist amidst
    the chaos of the Triglavian invasion.\n\n**Upwell Consortium Announces Small Arms
    Contract with AEGIS**\n\nYulai, Genesis  - Upwell Consortium Chairman Yani Sar
    Arteu expressed delight today, as he shook hands with Provost Marshal Kasiha Valkanir,
    the head of CONCORD's AEGIS division, at a gathering of defense contractors in
    Yulai. Shortly after their first time meeting in person the two signed an indefinite
    contract that marked Upwell Consortium as a supplier of armaments for the spacelane
    and installation security division.\n\nDuring the gathering, Chairman Arteu explained
    that the new contract comes with the public disclosure of a new line of small
    arms designed by Upwell Consortium. In accordance with the needs of the AEGIS
    division, the weapons are engineered for ease of production utilizing standardized
    components and a familiar aesthetic as well as modular capabilities. Representatives
    would not go into detail about the destructive capabilities, citing AEGIS operational
    security, though those later noted that the weapons appeared to be capable of
    immense damage.\n\n**In Other News**\n\n  * Royal Heir Arim Ardishapur Holding
