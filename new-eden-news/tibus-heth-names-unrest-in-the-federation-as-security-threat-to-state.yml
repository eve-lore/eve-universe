    [Tibus Heth](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tibus Heth) pointed at the recent
    hacker attack on a [Black Eagles](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Black Eagles)
    installation as proof that the [Federation](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente)
    is \"in a state of barely concealed chaos\" which presents a \"significant risk
    to the security of the Caldari State.\" According to Heth, \"The Federation is
    a viper perched on a rotten branch. Eventually that branch will snap and drop
    it right onto our heads.\"\n\n\"Already we see the cracks beginning to form,\"
    he went on. \"They have hackers directly attacking their government agencies.
    And if Blaque and his cohorts have their way, they'll stop at nothing short of
    the complete annihilation of the Caldari people. Already they have begun poisoning
    us with their venom, corrupting our executives, and turning them against us. Where
    will they go next?\"\n\nThe speech, which was characterized as \"disjointed\"
    by some observers, continued for several minutes. \"The State must remain vigilant
    against our enemies. We have already seen they can come from within. Even those
    we believe to be allies might remain distant when we need them most. We must stand
    on our own feet to fight those who want to destroy us.\"\n\nApparently, the speech
    was then cut short abruptly. A few in the crowd said Heth appeared to suffer from
    a sudden sharp pain and was hurriedly escorted off stage by [Provists](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari
    Providence Directorate). A representative then took the microphone and informed
    the crowd that Heth had been called away on critical matters. \n\nThe reception
    for the entire speech was viewed as supportive, though many noted it was rather
    muted compared to prior ones."
