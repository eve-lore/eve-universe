- body: "The Gallente Federation has issued a request to the Caldari State demanding
    indemnities for the selling of contaminated food products within Federal space.
    After inspecting the claims for that past several days, the Senate Committee pushed
    for the request to be made. It is the conclusion of the committee that Sukuuvestaa
    Corporation, the manufacturer of the tainted Protein Delicacies, was aware of
    their product\u2019s defective nature, but had willfully decided to sell it to
    the Federation nonetheless. The Federation is demanding both monetary reparations,
    as well as hi-tech equipment, such as cyber implants, to aid those unfortunates
    that have succumbed to the brain diminishing side effects of Protein Delicacies.
    The Senate committee believes it has a strong enough case to go full force against
    the Caldari within CONCORD and pursue this matter to the end. The Caldari have
    not yet responded to the demands made by the Federation, but it is believed they
    will wait for the Chief Executive Panel to pass a verdict, which should happen
    any day now."
