- body: 'Aridia -  An unidentified Imperial Navy fleet, apparently incorporating much
    of the Amarrian fleet exercising in Tash-Murkon yesterday, has resurfaced unannounced
    in the Aridia region. The Ministry of War has still not released any statement
    explaining these unannounced manoeuvres.


    While it has long been Naval policy to maintain a press blackout during scheduled
    exercises, it is also customary for affected parties to be notified in advance.
    Statements from the Tash-Murkon Family yesterday suggest that these protocols
    have not been observed, and while the Ministry has given no official comment,
    anonymous sources indicate that there is some confusion internally. Attempts to
    solicit comments from other Imperial Families, who maintain their own standing
    navies and are usually well-informed of Fleet movements, have so far yielded no
    conclusive information.'
