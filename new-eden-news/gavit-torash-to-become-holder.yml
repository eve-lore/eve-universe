- body: "In a press conference held on his future estate, Gavit Torash announced that
    he will officially become Holder of House Torash through a ceremony that is rarely
    performed in modern Amarr society. He next announced sweeping changes in House
    Torash\u2019s interstellar policies. Afterwards, he thanked Amarrian paramilitaries
    for their aid lend to the troubled House after the death of his father. \n\nAlthough
    reluctant to release details on how the house will be changing, Gavit claimed
    that once he has been made Holder of House Torash he will not only change the
    infrastructure of the house but also its involvement in interstellar affairs.
    With the date for the ceremony fast approaching, speculations on the nature of
    these changes have been widespread. One favorite theory is that the soon-to-be
    Holder sees an opportunity in working together with capsuleer pilots in securing
    a niche for House Torash in interstellar politics. \n\nDetails about the ceremony
    itself aren't well known outside the Amarr Empire. One component, however, is
    known to be vital to its execution; the presence of a member of an Amarrian Heir
    family, in this case the Kor-Azor family. Artico Kor-Azor himself is not expected
    to make an appearance, it is likely that one of his cousins will attend instead.
    \n\nInvitations for the ceremony have already been sent out to Amarrian Holders.
    Perhaps more surprisingly, an extended list of invited individuals also include
    important figures from outside the Empire, namely dignitaries from the Caldari
    State, Gallente Federation and Minmatar Republic. \n\nRepresentatives from the
    Kor-Azor family claim that Gavit Torash has been granted the right to the ceremony
    by virtue of his grandfather's importance to the family. Several hundred years
    ago, House Torash played an important part in modernizing one of their slave-run
    estate\u2019s industrial capabilities, increasing wheat and livestock output vastly.
    The extra resources were donated to the Kor-Azor family, who used them to alleviate
    threat of famine on one of their own worlds. \n\nAn anonymous source within the
    Republic Parliament, however, commented that \"It is despicable that the Heir
    would attempt to use these circumstances merely as propaganda in a time when they
    should be grieving and rebuilding. Surely a house of such importance would receive
    more than a simple ceremony in its time of need?\" House Kor-Azor itself declined
    to comment on this statement, although it is bound to strain relations further
    between the Kor-Azor family and the Minmatar Republic."
