    Abyssal Energies Spike as Deepflow Rifts Detected\n\nHidden rifts have begun to
    appear throughout New Eden as the SOCT reports spiking energy signatures in Abyssal
    Deadspace.\n\nThe Society of Conscious Thought has observed massive energy spikes
    in Abyssal Deadspace. The spikes originated in the Deepflows of the Abyss, beyond
    where any New Eden explorer has ventured. The energy signatures are similar to
    those recorded during the escalating Drifter and Triglavian war some months ago.
    It was widely believed that capsuleer intervention had successfully de-escalated
    their conflict, but it seems to have only caused a brief respite.\n\nThe Deepflow
    Rifts appear to be a result of the destructive energies unleashed in the Drifter-Triglavian
    war. These rifts are inaccessible to New Eden\u2019s pilots. This is likely because
    they lead to the far depths of Abyssal Deadspace which are untraversable with
    conventional technologies. Despite this, activating a significant number of tractor
    beams on the rift allows a pilot to pull objects through from the other side.
    These objects provide possible evidence of a long-term Triglavian presence in
    Deepflow regions. The science community is divided as to whether these objects
    are the remains of past settlements that drifted into the Deepflow, or a sign
    that the Triglavians are capable of surviving in even harsher environments than
    previously predicted.\n\nAt the same time, reports are coming in from Gallente,
    Caldari, Amarr, and Minmatar scientists that changes have been observed in other
    rifts. Abyssal Artifact Recovery operations have recorded shifting patterns, prompting
    calls for capsuleers to assist in investigating the changes. \n\nWhen asked to
    comment on any possible threat posed by the new rifts or the escalating conflict,
    CONCORD, EDENCOM, and the SOCT were all quick to dismiss the possibility. They
    claim that the conflict is too deep within the Abyss to pose a risk to the peoples
    of New Eden. In addition, sources within EDENCOM have revealed a controversial
    \u201Clet them fight\u201D policy in hopes that the Drifters and Triglavians will
    weaken each other, ultimately making the cluster a safer place.\n\n### News in
