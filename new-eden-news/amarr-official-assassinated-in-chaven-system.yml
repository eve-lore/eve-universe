    Minmatar rebels ambushed and killed the Amarr ambassador to the Ammatars. The
    official was carrying top-secret documents intended for the Ammatar Consulate.
    This latest development in the escalating hostilities between the Amarrians and
    the Minmatars is the most serious incident to date and is sure to bring harsh
    repercussions. The Minmatar Republic has already released a statement deploring
    the raid, while denying any knowledge of it. Exasperated Amarr officials have
    gone on record to state that the inability of the Republic in curbing the rebels
    was inexcusable and they implied that the Republic was just as responsible as
    the rebels themselves. The attack itself was carried out in a stunning dare and
    the name of the rebel responsible for podding the Amarr official is believed to
    be Aran'gar. Apart from the Amarr official there are no firm reports about further
    death or destruction in the ambush, though it is believed some Minmatar vessels
    were destroyed, including one battleship, thanks to the valiant efforts of \xD0iscorporation,
    which rushed to the rescue of the Amarr official. Even if his efforts where in
    vain the Imperial Chamberlain says he mentioned his name to the Emperor, who is
    very thankful for his heroic acts."
