- body: "Officials of the Gallente Federal Administration today insisted that a brewing
    dispute, between the massive FedMart corporation and a number of Sang Do overlords,
    in the Lirsautton home-system of the Jin-Mei nation, is entirely a matter for
    autonomous local authorities. FedMart, the largest retailer in the Federation,
    has allegedly precipitated social unrest throughout the agricultural heartlands
    of the Jin-Mei by approaching Jing-Ko caste farmers directly, in order to negotiate
    for their produce. This conflicts with the traditional produce brokerage done
    by district farm commissioners, themselves usually of the Saan Go administrative
    caste, on behalf of local land-owners. \n\nIn large parts of the Jin-Mei domains,
    the Sang Do caste overlords own vast estates that they lease to tenant farmers.
    Most of these farmers are actually moderately well-to-do members of the Jing-Ko
    caste, with their farms operating as independent businesses. Traditional practice,
    rooted in centuries of stable caste stratification and an economic pyramid with
    the Sang Do very definitely at the apex, has put the overlords in control of all
    forms of transactions, though largely through the agency of the legions of administrators
    and officials that make up the Saan Go caste. The FedMart decision to directly
    approach farmers to negotiate a price for their produce threatens that economic
    order and cuts out the two higher castes from the process. \n\nWhile it is entirely
    legal under Jin-Mei local law for farmers to sell to whomever they please, on
    whatever terms they can settle, it is very much contrary to the established social
    order and economic customs. While tenancy agreements very rarely contain exclusivity
    clauses, largely because they did not need to given the power of the caste system,
    the Sang Do overlords have begun to threaten sanctions, including eviction, against
    tenants who take up offers made by FedMart. In turn, FedMart has protested to
    the Federal Administration regarding those overlords and officials who have been
    seen to make such threats. \n\nCommenting on behalf of the Lirsautton Agricultural
    Commission, Overdistrict Commissioner Qui Fan said, \"This is an internal matter
    relevant to the local economy and social order of the Jin-Mei home worlds. Our
    guarantees of autonomy within the Federation place this entirely within the jurisdiction
    of the Commission, which acts for the Jin-Mei government and people. We do not
    appreciate the distorting interference of a megacorporation like FedMart and will
    act to protect our society.\" \n\nIn response, FedMart has released a statement
    contending that, \"Basic Federal law guarantees commercial freedom and unobstructed
    trade to all citizens and corporations of the Federation. We hold that the Federal
    Administration must act to halt any actions that could undermine these essential
    freedoms.\" For its part, the Federal Administration is maintaining that Jin-Mei
    autonomy covers this case and that it cannot act without a direct Presidential
    instruction, Supreme Court ruling or bill in the Federal Senate."
