- body: "Pator - The Minmatar Republic and the Thukker Tribe have formed an open border
    policy, Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor and Thukker Chief Einnar Aeboul jointly announced
    at a press conference today.\n\nThe agreement, coming after a week of talks between
    the two leaders, will allow Minmatar and Thukker citizens to travel freely between
    their respective territories.  The agreement, notably, also extends to the Starkmanir
    and Nefantar tribes currently sheltered in Thukker territory. \n\n\"With this
    historic agreement, we open the door for peoples of all tribes to finally return
    home,\" Shakor announced. \"We have already enacted several plans to allow us
    to cope with the influx of people, and I urge all Republic citizens to welcome
    our long-lost kin.\"  Shakor went on to say that he hoped this would be only the
    first step in a growing relationship between the Minmatar Republic and the Thukker
    Tribe.\n\nChief Aeboul also welcomed the agreement, but tempered his approval
    by saying that \"while this is indeed a historic occasion for the Minmatar people,
    the Thukker tribe still values its independence and way of life. I can assure
    everyone that we will not be relinquishing our sovereignty.\"  He also stated
    his tribe would welcome immigrants from the Republic, and finished by reminding
    those in attendance that while the Thukker life is a hard one, it is also exceptionally
    rewarding.\n\nThe agreement comes after several years of growing discord between
    the Republic and Thukker tribe. While Chief Aeboul made some strong remarks about
    his tribe's independent status, Sanmatar Shakor has made it clear he wishes a
    joint tribal government for all Minmatar, and several pundits have claimed this
    agreement is just the first step in his grand scheme to further that goal. Official
    sources have neither moved to confirm nor deny these claims."
