    - Manufacturing companies large and small have begun making aggressive plans to
    increase their output, with companies like Khanid Works and Carthum Conglomerate
    leading the charge. The driver behind this anticipated growth is the steadily
    increasing volume of high-end minerals entering Amarr space from the nearby regions
    of Delve and Querious.\n\nWracked by constant warfare between capsuleer alliances
    for the past two years, the regions have once again lapsed into relative tranquility.
    Doul Guribi, a manager for Carthum Conglomerate, explained, \"When the Band of
    Brothers and their vassals held unchallenged sway over the regions, valuable high-end
    minerals flowed into our factories like water. With the coming of the 'Great War'
    in the south, that flow slowed to a trickle.\" Guribi posited that this reduction
    stemmed from capsuleer alliances' hoarding of the minerals for their own war production,
    as well as the disruption of mining operations due to constant inter-alliance
    raiding.\n\nKhanid Works spokeswoman Urgiza Falant echoed this analysis. \"As
    one side or the other needed a quick infusion of capital we'd see the sale of
    large mineral stocks, but that was an irregular occurrence.\" Ms. Falant pointed
    out that the situation is fertile ground for large-scale market manipulation,
    and that fluctuations in prices and volumes sold could swing wildly until things
    settle into a new equilibrium.\n\nNow under the unified rule of GoonSwarm, Querious
    and Delve are once again poised to play a major role in supplying minerals to
    Amarr manufacturers. With key transport infrastructure only a few jumps from several
    high-security market and manufacturing hubs, GoonSwarm appears to be positioning
    itself to take advantage of this synergy.\n\nNot all Amarr industrialists are
    pleased by this development, however. In particular, GoonSwarm's tendency to target
    miners with suicide attacks has drawn the ire of Ducia Foundry, a corporation
    extensively invested in mining operations throughout New Eden. \"Without the distraction
    of a major war, we fear that these attacks will only grow more common,\" said
    Ducia spokesman Agadath Hejoul."
