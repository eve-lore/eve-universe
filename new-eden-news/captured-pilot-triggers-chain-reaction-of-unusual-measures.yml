- body: "Security in and around the station where the rogue Amarrian pilot was captured
    earlier this week has been shifted up to unprecedented levels in recent days.
    For the residents of Misaba, a system on the very fringes of Amarr space the change
    is abrupt and shocking.   \n  \nInside the station, an entire medical isolation
    section has been quarantined with guards being given shoot-to-kill orders for
    any civilians who approach. Externally it\u2019s a whole different picture. Navy
    security all the way from Amarr to the Zoar and Sons station in Misaba has been
    heightened with priority jumping and docking schedules set aside for navy personnel.
    \  \n  \nNo official report on the reasons behind the vast security measures has
    been given but rumours filtering down from various low ranking personnel involved,
    are telling stories of how when the pilot was removed unwillingly from his pod
    he broke into a psychotic rage. Reports go on to tell of savage injuries on the
    overwhelmed guards, with one particular guard suffering from multiple fractures
    of the right leg.   \n  \nWhat is also unusual for low tech manufacturing stations
    is to have top priority visits from the navy headquarters, but this station is
    apparently having them in abundance. These surprise visits show no signs of slowing,
    with 3 convoys in the last 2 days alone docking at the station with no signs of
    leaving. Perhaps more shockingly most of the passengers undocking are science,
    rather than military personnel.   \n  \nAll this extra attention has drawn the
    attention of a great many people, but with the security so high, anyone with more
    than just a fleeting interest would be a fool to try and get closer."
