- body: "New Caldari - The Caldari people remained solemnly glued to the news networks
    as they watched the Amarr defend against the Minmatar invasion. In a show of solidarity
    with the Amarr Empire several statements of support have issued forth from the
    State over the last hour. \n\nEvents took a sudden turn when those same screens
    were suddenly filled with footage of grey-hued Caldari Navy vessels pouring over
    Federation borders. Vast arrays of Federation surveillance drones, normally used
    to transmit live traffic information, have instead been relaying live feeds of
    their own homeland being invaded. \n\nThe response from the Caldari population
    has been electric. Workers and managers have laid down tools and headed for the
    nearest broadcast screen to watch the proceedings, and reports indicate that Gallente
    flags are being solemnly burnt all across the State. The Caldari media have been
    broadcasting one particularly poignant scene, depicting workers crowding round
    a bonfire quietly throwing any Federation paraphernalia they can find on it. No
    voices are raised but the intensity of the stares are not lost on anyone."
