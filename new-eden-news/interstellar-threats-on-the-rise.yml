- body: "According to a bi-monthly report submitted by the DED\u2019s Observation
    and Analysis Subcommittee yesterday, the numbers of illegal deadspace outposts
    harboring dangerous elements are steadily increasing on the fringes of CONCORD-policed
    space. The Guristas and Sansha\u2019s Nation are among the criminal organizations
    known to be building new outposts in various locations along the divide of the
    outer rim frontier.   \n  \nCentus Sansha, the Nation\u2019s wing of deadspace
    operatives, have according to the report built the first of a new type of True
    Power complex, the first of Sansha\u2019s outposts to be branded a Level 10 on
    the DED\u2019s Threat Assessment scale. Additionally, Gurista leaders have reportedly
    authorized a schematic for a new type of penal complex which the organization
    intends to build in several locations.   \n  \nThe report brought some good news
    as well. Due in no small part to consistent raids by capsuleer fighter pilots
    and empire navy forces, the resources of the Angels and the Serpentis have been
    weakened, leaving some of their most powerful strongholds in a somewhat weakened
    state. The DED has publicly commended the tireless efforts of capsuleer organizations
    to this end and remains firm in the belief that with their help, the tide of intergalactic
    crime may continue to be stemmed."
