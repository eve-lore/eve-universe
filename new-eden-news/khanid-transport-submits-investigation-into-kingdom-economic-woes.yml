- body: "Early this afternoon, Khanid Transport released some of the findings of a
    three month long investigation into the faltering Khanid economy in a press conference
    held at their corporate headquarters. \n\nThe investigation, commissioned by the
    Khanid government three months ago in response to increasing warning signs regarding
    the health of the Kingdom\u2019s economy, was headed by Khanid Transport director
    Isan Anmeal. With the entire report presented to King Khanid and his advisors
    this morning, Anmeal held a press conference in order to release selected excerpts
    from the report to the general public. \n\nThe major findings released to the
    public include the fact that in the last two quarters, Khanid Innovation and Khanid
    Works have suffered a 10% drop in revenue, and that Khanid Transport posted the
    first loss since the corporation\u2019s inception. As a result of this downturn
    in profits, unemployment within the Kingdom has risen markedly in recent times,
    reaching new record levels, and in turn fuelling civil unrest and disobedience
    on worlds and installations across the Kingdom. The report drew links between
    the Kingdom\u2019s economic decline and the alleged recession being experienced
    within the Caldari State, the Kingdom\u2019s largest trade partner in many lucrative
    industries, including the technology sector. Mention was also made, albeit to
    a lesser extent, to the significant number of trade agreements between the Kingdom
    and the Amarr Empire which were not renewed this fiscal year. \n\nOn receiving
    the Investigation report from Anmeal and Khanid Transport, representatives of
    the King were quick to release a statement emphasising the importance of the financial
    wellbeing of the Kingdom and its citizens to King Khanid. The statement went on
    to assure the populace that the directors of the three major national corporations
    \u2013 Khanid Transport, Khanid Works, and Khanid Innovation \u2013 along with
    the Royal Khanid Navy, are working tirelessly on finding a solution to what is
    looming as the first major crisis for the Kingdom in some time."
