- body: "An investigation into the disappearance of noted pharmacologist Ullia Hnolku,
    who along with his wife disappeared from Zainou Biotech\u2019s HQ in Isseras last
    month, has uncovered facts believed to pose a great threat to the biotech giant.
    \  \n  \nAccording to sources within the CEP Business Bureau, under whose authority
    the investigation was conducted, the pair are in possession of an experimental
    compound only recently developed in Zainou\u2019s main laboratories. The compound,
    Insorzapine bisulfate, was previously believed to be a mild euphoric, but facts
    uncovered during the course of the investigation now seem to indicate something
    with far greater potential implications.   \n  \nAccording to Special Counsel
    Tar Maurisi, head of the investigation, the drug is what\u2019s known as a reactive
    mutagen inhibitor, a compound whose active chemical responds dynamically to mutagens
    in an organism\u2019s body, limiting and eventually stifling their effectiveness
    completely. For certain diseased individuals, says Maurisi, this is revolutionary
    medicine: of more concern, however, is the fact that when given to a healthy organism
    the compound will attack natural DNA repair processes, causing a rapid chain reaction
    of cell suicide that within days leads to a cancerous death.   \n  \nThe Chief
    Executive Panel has ordered Ishukone Watch vessels to immediately cease and desist
    in all efforts to search for the missing scientists, and has handed executive
    authority in the matter to the Caldari Navy Operations Command, who as of yesterday
    afternoon have declared the two scientists Code-Five public hazards within Caldari-controlled
    space. Anyone with any information as to the pair\u2019s location is asked to
    contact Caldari Navy Vice Admiral Natakko Saijimo as soon as possible.   \n  \nMore
    on this as it develops."
