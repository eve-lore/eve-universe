    Amid slipping poll numbers, presidential contender and retired Rear-Admiral Daren
    Fasio has announced his withdrawal from the race. Addressing a disappointed but
    supportive crowd at a press conference this morning, Mr. Fasio took the opportunity
    to endorse Governor Celes Aguard's candidacy, saying, \"though Governor Aguard
    and I have disagreed on several issues, I feel strongly that she is an able candidate
    for the presidency. Further, she has the best interests of the Federation at heart,
    and I believe she has the political will to do what is necessary to preserve and
    defend this great nation.\"\n\nWhile extremely popular among both serving and
    retired military personnel, Fasio's candidacy has been plagued since the beginning
    by a message that many have viewed as extreme. Fasio's stated intention of instituting
    a draft and putting the Federation's economy on a war-footing has won him few
    friends in the business community.\n\nFasio's campaign was also hurt by his own
    demeanor, described by many as \"overly impersonal.\" Zalawi Marguva, a political
    analyst for The Scope contrasted candidates Aguard and Fasio after a recent debate,
    saying, \"The way these two address crowds publicly is very different. Governor
    Aguard delivers rousing political speeches designed to fire peoples' ardor. Admiral
    Fasio delivers dry, fact-filled briefings designed to inform peoples' decisions.\"\n\nGiven
    the similarities between their platforms, Fasio's withdrawal would naturally lend
    to a bump in Governor Aguard's numbers. His endorsement was symbolic however,
    and Governor Aguard thanked Mr. Fasio graciously, saying \"Admiral Fasio's spirit
    of service, both in and out of uniform, should be an example for us all. He has
    been an honorable and worthy adversary.\""
