- body: "Minmatar cities based on the continent of Ebrembrur on Edmalbrurdus VI are
    reporting a shortage of Vitoc antidote. Believed to be due to a recent mutation
    of the viral toxin, this development leaves Gallentean and Minmatar scientists
    fighting as they yet again struggle to unravel this particular strain\u2019s attributes.
    Authorities report that although there is no cause for alarm yet, Vitoc antidote
    distribution centres need to be frugal with their reserves.   \n  \nFederation
    Senators have visited several of these centres. Senator Duvaille was quoted as
    saying:   \n  \n\"It was horrifying. I personally witnessed several freed slaves
    being brought in to receive their treatment, only to be shown the door again because
    their last dose was just a day or two ago. They were sent away in agony by hospital
    staff who assumed they could \u2018bear the pain\u2019 for another day. I can\u2019t
    tolerate such inhumane treatment of people, and I will propose a bill today at
    the Federation Senate to make Federation sponsored purchases of Vitoc antidote
    to relieve these poor, suffering wretches.\"   \n  \nAlej Nkosai, lead physician
    at the Elder Shiamu Centre for Rehabilitation, had the following to say:   \n
    \ \n\"Although we\u2019re grateful for the Senator\u2019s intent to start a months-long
    procedure to aid us, we don\u2019t need it. Our usual supplies of Vitoc antidote
    are dwindling, but I assure you, we are doing nearly everything in our power to
    secure a new batch. Yes, it\u2019s true that we have to turn away people that
    don\u2019t need the drug yet, and yes it\u2019s true that these people are suffering,
    but nothing works better to steel their nerves than knowing they endure and continue
    to endure their pain in freedom.\"   \n  \nRoughly 60% of all freed slaves are
    infected with the toxin, which is used widely by the Amarrian Empire to control
    slaves. Death by withdrawal is reported to be extremely painful and is usually
    drawn out over the course of a few days."
