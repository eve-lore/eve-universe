    Federation Senator Charged with Conspiracy to Commit Acts of Terrorism\n\nVillore,
    Essence \u2013 Outspoken Labor-Populist Senator Thibauld Tailler was expelled
    from the Senate yesterday, according to official reports. The decision was made
    by the Senate Disciplinary Committee and confirmed by the Senate following accusations
    by the Federal Intelligence Office (FIO) that he is a founding member of the terrorist
    organization \"Gallentia Primacy\". Tailler's whereabouts are currently unknown.\n\nAccording
    to Senate officials, the Disciplinary Committee proceedings were initially carried
    out in secrecy in order to avoid alerting Tailler. Based on the evidence provided
    by the FIO, the former Senator has been charged with conspiracy to commit acts
    of terrorism, murder, the misappropriation of federal funds, and treason. A cluster-wide
    manhunt is underway for the former Senator. There has been no news regarding his
    location, but Federation authorities have informed the Scope that they are confident
    he will be apprehended soon.\n\nThibauld Tailler was elected to office as a member
    of the Labor-Populists party for the largely industrial subdistrict of North-West
    Astrin, and was considered to be on the right-wing of a party with greatest appeal
    among the Gallente working classes. A veteran of the battle of Caldari Prime,
    Tailler ran on a platform of increased military spending and sanctions against
    Caldari imports. \n\nEarlier this year Tailler was appointed to a military spending
    oversight subcommittee. According to the FIO, it was then that he began working
    to channel funds and military assets to associates. The FIO allege he and other
    like-minded veterans used these funds and equipment to build their own paramilitary
    force, the Gallentia Primacy. The Labor-Populists have moved to expel Tailler
    from their party, accelerating a process that began following an internal dispute
    over his remarks on the United Response Act riots.\n\nGallentia Primacy has been
    confirmed as responsible for a number of recent terrorist attacks on Federal facilities.
    The group identifies itself as ultranationalist in the tradition of the Guardians
    of Gallentia. Disbanded since before the Yoiul Conference, the Guardians party
    was in power during the first Caldari-Gallente War. The Primacy's philosophy may
    have been alluded to by Tailler at a press conference just hours before his expulsion:
    \"The dream of old Gallentia has been sullied by the soft hands of compromise
    and the tears of the weak. The future belongs to the Gallente, but the politicians
    in Villore would rather choke good and true citizens with red tape than sieze
    it.\" Tailler disappeared from public view shortly after giving this speech.\n\nAddressing
    the press after Tailler's expulsion from the Senate, President Aguard delivered
    a stern warning on the ultranationalist philosophy: \"It deeply concerns me that
    anyone who served inside these halls could look back on the brutality and injustices
    of our dark past and draw inspiration. This was a time when our people were not
    safe from their own government. A time when our rulers committed atrocities and
    risked everything to escalate the conflict. Ultranationalism claims to be a return
    to old values, yet it forgets the most precious of them all: Liberty.\"\n\n![tetrimon

    Mission Destroyed in Surprise Attack by Heretical Cult\n\nNererut, Domain \u2013
    An Amarr charitable mission to mining colonies in the Nererut system was destroyed
    in a surprise attack yesterday. A group calling themselves the \"Disciples of
    Purity\" has taken responsibility for the attack. \n\nIn a holoreel released by
    the Disciples of Purity, a masked figure calling himself the \"Grand Incarnate\"
    said that the attack had taken place because the mission had been providing aid
    to seeking freedom under the terms of Empress Catiz I's recent emancipation edict.
    In the holoreel the group made a number of demands including calls for the abdication
    of the \"pretender Catiz Tash-Murkon\", the dissolution of the \"corrupted Heir
    families\", and a reinstatement of the long defunct \"Council of Apostles\" to
    select a new \"true blooded Emperor.\" \n\nThe Disciples claim to be a \"new sword
    of justice, forged from the dual blades of scripture's greatest defenders\u201D.
    The exact meaning of this is not clarified in the holoreel. Nonetheless, the group's
    name and its demands regarding the Council of Apostles have led to speculation
    that the \"dual blades\" refers to the Purity of the Throne heresy and the Order
    of St. Tetrimon. The Order's Grandmaster Khemon Dulsur an-Tetrimon has repudiated
    any connection to the Disciples of Purity, condemning the attack as \"an unconscionable
    act of heretical butchery finding no justification in Scripture as the Order of
    St. Tetrimon understands it.\"\n\nThe Emperor Family issued an official condemnation
    of the group, swiftly followed by the leaders of all Royal and Major Houses. The
    Ministry of Internal Order has confirmed that an investigation is underway, but
    sources within the Amarr government suggest that it has yet to uncover much about
    the organization.\n\nQuestions still remain as to who is funding the Disciples
    of Purity or how they may have obtained a fleet. Further reports of attacks on
    other Holy Missions have continued to come in. However, no members of the Disciples
    have been identified so far as it appears they wear masks at all times. Any attempts
    to capture one of their vessels has resulted in its crew opting for self-destruction
    over capture and interrogation.\n\n![amarr shipcaster mehatoor](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/zbqH0AqODSQ4QsxRnTcHA/511e3614b7e3cd766a4f69219b764e78/amarr_shipcaster_mehatoor.png)
    *Above: Amarr Interstellar Shipcaster in the Mehatoor system*\n\n### Amarr Interstellar
    Shipcaster Fully Operational in Mehatoor System\n\nMehatoor, Devoid \u2013 The
    Amarr Empire has brought online its new Interstellar Shipcaster in the Mehatoor
    system, along with the Stellar Transmuter in Ohide providing the necessary resources
    to operate the Triglavian-derived technology. The achievement makes the Amarr
    Empire the second of the \"Big 4\" powers to gain access to the long-range travel
    technology after the Caldari State's impressive development project came to fruition
    a month ago.\n\nThe Amarr Empire has begun deploying Shipcaster Beacon constructors
    to the Amarr-Minmatar militia warzone in a similar fashion to that in the Caldari-Gallente
    warzone for the Caldari State. The Minmatar Republic's efforts to obtain the technology
    are also nearing completion, with the Republic having commenced the constrution
    phase of its own project in the Amo and Barkrik systems.\n\nReports from the Caldari
    State indicate that the lead in understanding and operating the technology has
    led to a number of associated projects and a program for the Caldari Navy to use
    the system for extended logistics. In particular, it has been suggested by some
    observers of activity in the DS-M4Q constellation of Syndicate region that certain
    traffic patterns and energy signatures picked up in the area could indicate secret
    beacons used by the State's military and colonization efforts. Persistent rumors
    at the edges of Caldari military and mercenary groups also suggest the State is
    pressing on with efforts to increase fine scale control over the technology, and
    solve the problems of operating both casters and beacons within planetary gravity
    wells. \n\n![shipcaster linked arderonne open](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/11BgtzUGWxRMgE0R8Q5Lnb/d15191cbbf24439ebaf8d6ea330d4bda/shipcaster_linked_arderonne_open.png)
