- body: "Piak\u2013 Tibus Heth, a low-grade MTAC operator for Caldari Constructions
    and leader of a worker uprising, has acquired an ownership stake in the corporation
    following the voluntary surrender of personal shares and stock options by the
    corporation\u2019s executive board, and by an anonymous financier who seized advantage
    of the earlier selloff to buy up huge quantities of stock. Torkebaira Shutsu,
    the former CEO and last executive to cede personal shares to Heth, ended his life
    shortly afterwards. The gruesome scene in the Constructions boardroom ends a standoff
    at the Armor Forge manufacturing plant that has the entire Caldari State captivated,
    although many questions remain. \n\n\u201CThe Secure Commerce Commission will
    investigate every detail of this ownership transfer thoroughly\u201D, promised
    Chairman Eman Autrech amidst vocal concerns raised by the mega-corporations. \u201CThe
    legality of this takeover will be determined pending our evaluation of the means
    through which it was executed.\u201D Meanwhile, security throughout the State
    is hastily being bolstered over fears that the outrage over Kaalakiota\u2019s
    use of deadly force will begin to spill over. Including the Constructions worker
    shot dead by Home Guard troops, the death toll at the Armor Forge stands at 34.
