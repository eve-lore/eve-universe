- body: "A leaked document from the Amarrian Empirical Succession Committee has been
    circling news agencies in the EVE Universe. Apparently each of the five houses
    will let a small number of champions compete amongst themselves on who shall represent
    their house in the championship that ultimately decides which house gets the throne.
    \  \n  \nChampionship fights are frigate matches where a champion along with three
    wingmen must destroy the ships of a competing champion and his wingmen. While
    the champion himself must be of pure Amarrian descent, his wingmen are said to
    be allowed to be of any race and bloodline.   \n  \nIn order to select the champions
    that will compete within each hose, the comittee is opting for a controversial
    method: As a gesture of continuing Heideran VII's legacy of honoring the traditions
    of other nations, they will allow for every Amarrian citizen to vote for a champion.
    \ \n  \nThis hint of democracy has outraged various Amarrian fundamentalists,
    amongst them Jamyl Sarum, whose spokesman denounces this method of selection as
    \"Heretical and fit for ants and vermin but not pure blooded Ammarians\". He elaborated:
    \"Democracy is a proven failure throughout the known Universe and has undermined
    many civilisations and been the death of many great organisations\".   \n  \nIt
    seems that this will go through nonetheless. Details of this are expected to surface
    in the coming days."
