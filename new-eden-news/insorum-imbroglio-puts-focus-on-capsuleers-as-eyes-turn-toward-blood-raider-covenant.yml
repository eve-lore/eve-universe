- body: "Last week saw the brutal murder of infamous Caldari scientist Dr. Ullia Hnolku
    at the hands of a force of capsuleers known as the Caldari Independent Navy Reserve.
    As reported by various eyewitnesses, the doctor was shot down in the Magiko system
    while being escorted to safety by a twenty-strong fleet of Matari freedom fighter
    ships. Apparently Dr. Hnolku, weakened by blood loss after a savage knife attack
    earlier that evening, had made an error in judgment and engaged his shuttle\u2019s
    warp drive too soon, thus running into an ambush set up by his pursuers.   \n
    \ \nDetails are sketchy at this point on whether the doctor\u2019s prototype for
    Insorum bisulfate, rumored to represent a cure for Vitoc withdrawal, made its
    way into the hands of Caldari or Matari forces. A number of unconfirmed reports
    state that Matari alliance the Ushra\u2019Khan are currently in possession of
    the prototype, but no concrete evidence has surfaced as of yet.   \n  \nThe incident
    is reported to have inspired a great deal of vehemence among government officials
    at all levels of the four empires, though a remarkably low number of official
    statements have been made. Political analyst Jozek Molaine describes the situation
    thus: \u201CWith such a potential destabilizer as this prototype hanging on the
    line, tensions are high. Everyone is being politically cautious, and with good
    reason. The slightest move could cause a ripple effect that can destroy worlds.\u201D
    \  \n  \nIn the face of this uneasy diplomatic stand-off, the capsuleer parties
    involved in what has become known as \u201CThe Insorum Imbroglio\u201D have been
    thrust into the limelight via GalNet, the capsuleer community\u2019s podium venue.
    GalNet was optioned as a holofeed by CONCORD\u2019s Communications Regulation
    Agency not long ago and has since [soared in popularity](http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=652&tid=4),
    not least these past few weeks. Cultural analysts and political commentators have
    noted the increase in the public\u2019s interest in capsuleer affairs and this
    powerful class\u2019s growing influence on world events. Stated one Gallente pundit,
    \u201CThey\u2019re the new stars in the sky.\u201D   \n  \nSome see even darker
    things behind the four empires\u2019 cautious silence. In the case of the Caldari
    State, _Federation Marquee_ journalist Maxim Peltast, in an article two days ago,
    stated: \u201CThose putrid rat bastards are just happy there are lap dogs out
    there doing their dirty work. They\u2019re not doling out pats on the back, sure,
    but notice the loud and clear lack of public condemnation. If it\u2019s not obvious
    to you that they\u2019re happy as fedos in mud over this, then you have no business
    among the breathing.\"   \n  \nAs reports continue to come in of warring capsuleer
    factions turning their attention to the Bleak Lands \u2013 home of the Blood Raider
    Covenant, captors of Dr. Hnolku\u2019s wife and reported possessors of the Insorum
    prototype \u2013 the universe waits and watches for the next turn of events.   \n
    \ \nMore news as they arrive."
