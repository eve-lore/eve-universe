- body: "Incredible footage was released today of Minmatar Police vessels making a
    co-ordinated planetary swoop on what was thought to be one of the largest 'Slave
    Farms' in existence. Although only a few hundred malnourished captives were set
    free, according to the Police who have seized records left at the site, close
    to a million Minmatar slaves had been \u2018processed\u2019 there in the last
    two years - most, we must assume, destined for various plantations and factories
    within the Amarr Empire. \n\nBut what has caused most shock and alarm is that
    the ringleaders and personnel in charge of the farm were Minmatar nationals and
    the farm itself located deep within Republic borders. Despite continued and stern
    denials of their existence from the Amarr Empire it is thought that up to a dozen
    Slave Farms exist within Amarr territory, but this is the first time one has been
    located outside of the Empire. \n\n\"Over the last six months our border patrols
    have doubled their efforts to bring to an end the deplorable business of the Amarr
    slave traders who for decades have raided border settlements and raped entire
    villages on our frontier worlds.\" Said Muar Karid, Sheriff Chief Of Internal
    Security \"Sadly the demand for slaves has not fallen and the Amarrians have employed
    even more disgusting methods to enslave our people.\" \n\nUnsurprisingly Amarr
    officials have refused to comment on what they call 'an internal matter for the
    Republic'. Republic Prime Minister Karin Midular too has yet to make a statement
    on the Police action, keen, it seems, to wait until further evidence comes to
    light. According to some reports there are still some minor skirmishes between
    Police units and mercenary security forces and many of the leaders have yet to
    be fully questioned. \n\nPrime Minister Midular's silence has however enraged
    opposition leaders. Veshta Preda, the Krusual spokesperson was quick to heap more
    pressure on a leader becoming ever more isolated by the day: \"By his inaction
    on this matter and his subservient past dealings with the Amarr Empire, it is
    clear that our Prime Minister would be better qualified to run an Amarrian plantation
    than he would the Minmatar Republic.\" She continued: \"Given the hardships of
    our people, no person willing to turn a blind eye to slavery can call themselves
    Minmatar. These people; the administrators and security personnel who ran this
    deplorable detention centre are by their actions the sub-human stooges of Amarrian
    thugs. Clearly without Amarr money or the demand for forced human labour this
    deplorable operation would not have existed.\" \n\nIt is clear that whether or
    not the Amarr Empire was behind the running of this slave farm, or indeed any
    other slave farms, the issue that is now engulfing the Minmater Parliament is
    one of political point-scoring. There has been little or no debate over the shocking
    conditions that some of the slaves were living in, or indeed the worrying discovery
    of cloning equipment on the farm, a find that adds weight to the many conspiracy
    theories already circulating about unregistered clones being produced for the
    human labour market."
