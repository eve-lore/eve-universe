- body: 'Pator, Heimatar - The All Tribes Engineering Consortium (ATEC), a group of
    engineering firms based in the Minmatar Republic, has revealed a new business
    technology partnership with the Republic University aimed at upgrading toolmaking
    and heavy manufacturing plants. Using its extensive contacts within the Gallente
    Federation, the University has acquired licensing rights for a number of technologies,
    and is able to provide templates and facilitate importation of advanced machinery
    at preferential rates. It is understood that accords have been reached between
    the relevant patent authorities in the Federation and the Republic to enable this
    unusually open technology-sharing arrangement.


    ATEC Chairman Isak Garfyr told us, "This new partnership is primarily between
    the Republic University and, through ATEC, home corporations such as Ashok Construction
    and Plant, KOSTORG and SebSystems. We are focused on engineering and the provision
    of tools and manufacturing plants for the rest of the industrial base. Owing to
    the good offices of our brothers and sisters in the Federation, not to mention
    the Gallente themselves, we have been able to achieve import and distribution
    rights for a number of technologies and advances on existing technologies within
    the Republic."


    Chairman Garfyr further indicated that ATEC hoped the venture would serve as a
    model for other industrial sectors. As part of the initiative, the University
    is arranging for residencies in the Republic on behalf of Minmatar in the Federation
    able to provide expertise and training in these new technologies.'
