    As the Federation presidential elections draw closer, the issue of voting rights
    for citizens of occupied systems has been raised by the Senate. Debate over the
    issue consumed much of the Senate's deliberations today.  \n  \nSenators from
    occupied space, led by a coalition of senators from the Placid region, have strongly
    pressed that elections still be held as normal in the occupied systems, despite
    the logistical difficulties. According to the senators, their constituents are
    highly invested in the upcoming election, which will dictate the future face of
    Federation politics and its stance toward the ongoing war with the Caldari State.
    The senators proposed several methods of holding the elections in the occupied
    systems, such as requesting the neutral assistance of the Servant Sisters of EVE,
    holding secret balloting, and other covert methods.  \n  \nPolitical experts,
    invited to the Senate assembly to weigh in on the subject, raised numerous issues
    with the prospect, leading to the formation of a strong opposition to any plans.
    \"The task of collecting, tallying, and verifying votes would be nigh-impossible
    with the continued communications blockade  enforced by the Caldari State on occupied
    systems,\" noted veteran election organizer Fitale Jean. \"That is to say nothing
    of ensuring that voters are aware of who they're voting for and the high possibility
    of fraud.\"  \n  \nDespite the experts' recommendations, the legality of an election
    where a portion of the populace was denied the right to vote remains murky. The
    Senate broke session without coming to a conclusion, but the debate is expected
    to resume in the following days."
