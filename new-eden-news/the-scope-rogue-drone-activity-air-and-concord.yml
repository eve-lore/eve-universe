    Laboratories Stations Fully Operational as Investigations into Attacks Continue**\n\n
    Cistuvaert, Verge Vendor \u2013 Despite suffering rogue drone swarm attacks at
    their observatory posts, and a previous series of attacks on capsuleer training
    facilities by \"unknown forces\", the Association for Interdisciplinary Research
    is reporting that its new stations are \"fully operational and secure.\" The technology
    and advanced training startup has refused to comment on the latest incidents affecting
    their research into rogue drones but a confidential source has confirmed AIR Laboratories
    have \"initiated investigations into what went wrong and the lessons that may
    be learned.\"\n\n In recent days, the organization has been more forthcoming regarding
    the reported attacks by unknown forces on AIR training centers. Vesper Calytrix,
    Vice President of AIR Operations, issued a statement confirming an ongoing investigation:
    \"A number of AIR Laboratories facilities were recently targeted in an unconscionable
    attack. The AIR family mourns the tragic loss of life and extends its most heartfelt
    condolences to all those impacted by these events. We are cooperating with the
    appropriate law enforcement agencies while simultaneously conducting our own independent
    investigation into the attacks. Rest assured, the perpetrators behind these cowardly
    and inexcusable acts of violence will be brought to justice.\"\n\n<iframe width=\"720\"

    Saraki Addresses Caldari State as New Chair of Chief Executive Panel**\n\n New
    Caldari Prime \u2013 Chairman Akimaka Saraki has addressed the Caldari State following
    his confirmation as permanent head of the Chief Executive Panel by the \"Big 8\"
    megacorporations at the annual State Industrial Planning Summit. The new CEP Chair's
    speech emphasized the duty of Caldari to the State, their corporations and their
    families, leaning heavily on imagery of the rise of the State out of the Caldari-Gallente
    War to its current prosperity under the megacorporations.\n\n Akimaka Saraki first
    emerged onto the public stage within the State as a senior director within the
    Wiyrkomi Corporation responsible for infrastructure security. Saraki played a
    key role in the effort to fortify the planets of Samanuni system against Triglavian
    invasion. When the system itself was invaded, Saraki took personal command of
    the planetary defense of Samanuni VI as highest ranking corporate leader with
    military experience.\n\n Saraki's role as a voice supporting the right of Caldari
    citizens to protest corporate malfeasance and incompetence cemented his reputation
    as a relatively liberal while patriotic figure at home. As an envoy to CONCORD,
    Saraki was also able to assist in averting open war during the EOM terror crisis.
    Shortly after this, with former CEP Chair Puok Kossinen disabled by his injuries,
    the CEP appointed Akimaka Saraki as Acting Chair of the CEP, elevating him to
    the leadership of the Caldari State.\n\n The permanent confirmation of Saraki
    represents a political victory for the Combine TNR grouping of Hyasyoda, Ishukone,
    and Wiyrkomi \u2013 the so-called \"Ocean Faction\" of Caldari megacorporations.
    Chairman Saraki is understood to have been accorded special executive powers by
    the CEP to oversee the reform of Caldari State armed forces following the disastrous
    losses during the Triglavian invasions.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/liberation_halls_stn_pator.png)
    \ \n\n*Above: New Halls of Liberation Station and Liberation Games Monument in
    Orbit of Matar, Pator System*\n\n**Sanmatar and Thukker Chief Hold Official Opening
    Ceremony at Halls of Liberation**\n\n Pator, Heimatar \u2013 Sanmatar Maleatu
    Shakor and Thukker Chief Einnar Aeboul officiated at the formal opening ceremony
    of the new Halls of Liberation station orbiting Matar (Pator IV) yesterday. The
    new station will be operated by the Thukker Tribe for the next year due to their
    victory during the inaugural Liberation Games.\n\n The station has been constructed
    as a place to remember the sacrifices of the Minmatar people during the Great
    Rebellion against Amarr rule. Although the Thukker Tribe will operate the station
    it is formally neutral territory in terms of the Seven Tribes of Matar. Overall
    responsibility for station security rests with the Thukker but large areas within
    the station are under Republic jurisdiction, and tribal and clan enclaves within
    the station have been established.\n\n To fulfill the primary purpose of the Halls
    of Liberation station, it contains many memorial chambers and shrines to the memory
    of the heroes of the Great Rebellion. Of particular note is a large museum containing
    sections for each tribe, the civilization of the old Minmatar Empire, and the
    history of the Tribal Republic of the Minmatar. The station is perhaps more widely
    significant as the first in orbit to open for capsuleer traffic, leading to a
    large number of Minmatar corporations and agencies opening offices aboard the
    facility.\n\n**In Other News**\n\n* EDENCOM Budget Agreed With Responsibilty for
