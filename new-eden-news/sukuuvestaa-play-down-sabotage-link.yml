- body: "SAISIO - Sukuuvestaa Corporation officials have issued a strenuous denial
    of involvement in the guerrilla attacks on arch-rival Kaalakiota Corporation's
    property in Sirppala. \n\nMasked individuals had launched an attack on a guard
    post at a Kaalakiota Factory which injured two security employees and left the
    building defaced with graffiti. \n\nThe attack was the latest in a growing trend
    for unrest in the region following a fall-out between KC officials and union leaders
    over proposed pay-cuts and poor working conditions. A number of leading commentators
    had to a greater or lesser degree pointed accusing fingers at Sukuuvestaa, something
    that angered their PR chief co-ordinator Oilenen Inuki. \n\nInuki said: \"We at
    Sukuuvestaa Corporation categorically deny any involvement with Kaalakiota's problems
    in the Sirppala system. \n\n\"If these so called experts sat and thought for a
    minute rather than be desperate to appear first on any holo-vid programme they
    can find they might wonder why we had meddle in their affairs when they are doing
    such a superb job of bringing themselves down from the inside,\" added Inuki.
    \n\nNiteloho Koirolen, Inuki's counterpart at Kaalakiota Corporation confirmed
    his rivals' claims. Koriolen said: \"Our preliminary investigations indicate that
    Sukuuvestaa had nothing to do with the attack on our factory.\" \n\n\"Kaalakiota
    internal security officers have been on the scene since just after the attack
    and have found no evidence linking any other corporation to it,\" stated Koirolen.
    \n\nWith the company trying to recover from a significantly reduced output in
    the affected systems, shares unsurprisingly have slipped 3% to 78.57."
