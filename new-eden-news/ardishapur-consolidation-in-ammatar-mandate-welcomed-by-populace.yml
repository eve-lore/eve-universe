    - Over a year since the Elder Invasion of Derelik, and more than six months since
    Empress Jamyl I assigned the Ammatar Mandate to Royal Heir Yonis Ardishapur as
    his personal fief, the consolidation of Ardishapur rule in the Mandate appears
    to be almost universally welcomed by the Ammatar populace. While the after-effects
    of the invasion continue to be felt, the influx of Ardishapuran aid and expertise
    to the Mandate has steadily eased the worst of them and restored the Derelik region's
    economy.\n\nSince taking possession of the Mandate, Yonis Ardishapur has made
    large sums available to the Ammatar Consulate and the Ammatar Fleet. Civil and
    military reconstruction are proceeding at a rapid pace, with the recovery from
    the devastation wrought by the Elder Invasion largely complete in all but the
    most heavily damaged areas, such as the Jarizza system. While large slave workforce
    transfers have also been made from Ardishapur holdings into the Mandate, the amount
    of reconstruction work needed, combined with the fall in population due to the
    invasion and subsequent defections, has led to many jobs being created. With employment
    levels reaching an unprecedented 93% of able-bodied Ammatar (compared with 82%
    prior to the invasion), the overall prosperity and well-being of the Mandate population
    has increased significantly.\n\n\"The invasion seems like a terrible dream these
    days,\" said Eyfor Farel, a construction worker with the Ammatar Consulate civil
    reconstruction corps. \"Of course, we see reminders that it was not a dream every
    day, but our lives are getting back to normal now. We have work, homes, food.
    God has provided these through the wisdom of the Empress and Lord Ardishapur.\"
    While these sentiments are shared by all Ammatar in public, some privately wonder
    if the Ammatar will be permanently relegated to a subservient status within the
    Mandate, following the appointment by Yonis Ardishapur of True Amarr Holders to
    most key positions."
