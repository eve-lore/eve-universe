    Maleatu Shakor has declared that the upcoming tribal assembly is to be delayed
    until the end of the third quarter this year, rather than being held shortly after
    the middle of the year as originally planned, in order to \"give our Nefantar
    and Starkmanir brothers and sisters more time to properly carry out the crucial
    task of selecting their tribal chiefs.\" Although it is a response to concerns
    expressed by Minmatar converts over the killing of Abel Jarek some days ago, and
    the political complications this has caused in those tribes, the announcement
    also reflects the reality that the political groundwork for the assembly has not
    been completed.\n\nMany of the Nefantar who defected from the Ammatar Mandate
    to the Minmatar Republic remain adherents of the Amarr religion, some having fled
    in fear of general reprisals by Amarrian forces and others wishing simply to live
    in the Minmatar home worlds. While they do not constitute a majority among the
    returned Nefantar, they make up a significant bloc within the tribe and are pressing
    the issue of representation, complicating the already delayed process of appointing
    clan leaders and the overall tribal chief.\n\nSimilarly, many Starkmanir maintain
    Amarrian beliefs, while a much smaller segment of their tribe are becoming involved
    in the political process for selecting the chief. At the request of Sanmatar Shakor,
    the Brutor Tribe advisors working with the Starkmanir are treating all points
    of view with respect, including those Starkmanir who still choose to follow the
    Amarrian faith.\n\nGiven the charged atmosphere that has arisen around the two
    tribes' selection processes, the Sanmatar took the decision to formally delay
    the tribal assembly. While the Sanmatar's office acknowledges that this will ease
    other difficulties and give more time for planning, aides insist that the Sanmatar's
    main hope is that \"more time for reflection will allow the Nefantar and Starkmanir
    to choose their new chiefs wisely.\""
