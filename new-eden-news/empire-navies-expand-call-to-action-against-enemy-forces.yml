- body: _Yulai_ - [CONCORD's](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/CONCORD) request
    that capsuleers assist in an assault on high-priority targets has been amended
    with a warning of potential retribution from enemy combatants. "We have reason
    to believe that our assault on this threat to [New Eden](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/New
    Eden \(cluster\)) will be met not only with open hostility, but with a cold and
    calculated counterblow," said Kilkkuken Mallen, CONCORD representative. "There
    are powers at work here that do not have the best interest of New Eden at heart,
    and they are gathering their forces as we speak. We fear we will have to deal
    with considerably greater opposition than originally expected, so we implore capsuleers
    yet again to side with the forces of all that is right and just - and, again,
    leave all the cleaning up to us."
