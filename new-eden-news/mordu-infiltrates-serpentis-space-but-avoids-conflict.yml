- body: "A Mordu's Legion task force under the leadership of Muryia Mordu himself
    infiltrated Serpentis space in the Fountain region yesterday and moved deep into
    its territory. The task force refrained from any direct conflict with Guardian
    Angel ships or Serpentis ships. Instead, the task force headed straight for Serpentis
    Prime in the Phoenix constellation and approached the chemical refinery orbiting
    the second moon of Serpentis Prime VIII. As the station readied its defenses Mordu's
    task force halted and orbited the station at exactly 30 km distance. Mordu then
    employed an unknown device from his flag ship; a device that radiated purple-greenish
    light and pulsed like a quasar. The device was aimed at the Serpentis station
    for several minutes before disappearing again into Mordu's ship. The task force
    then promptly left and headed out of the system before the pirates could muster
    a response team.   \n  \nAccording to the latest news Mordu is still on the prowl
    deep inside Serpentis territory, though avoiding any direct confrontation with
    pirate forces as before. Considering the strength of the Serpentis and Guardian
    Angels it is remarkable that the Legion has managed to bypass their defenses with
    such ease. Perhaps Mordu has more strange devices onboard, one that helps him
    get around unnoticed? If so, did he get them from ORE? And where did ORE get them?"
