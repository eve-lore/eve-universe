- body: "Netsalakka, The Bleak Lands - An official report by the Amarrian Ministry
    of Assessment yesterday revealed that The Bleak Lands has become the most dangerous
    sector of settled space in the Amarr Empire, a title previously held by the sparsely-settled
    region of Aridia. Long known to harbor pockets of Blood Raider loyalists, The
    Bleak Lands has seen a marked increase in the number of pirate raids in the last
    several months.   \n  \nIn particular, the number of miners and prospectors in
    space attacked and destroyed by pirates (a statistic closely tracked by the Ministry
    of Assessment) has risen sharply. Curiously, many of these attacks lack some of
    the more gruesome hallmarks (exsanguination, mutilation, etc) that have come to
    characterize Blood Raider attacks. This has led many to speculate that there is
    a new group of pirates plying the region. A contrary view points to a potential
    schism within the Blood Raiders organization, with members letting some of the
    more esoteric practices of the cult fall by the wayside in favor of simple piracy.
    \  \n  \nWhatever the case, the rise in hostile encounters with pirates has left
    many miners, haulers, and Holders in the area nervous. Santivar Khazhad, a prospector
    who has worked in The Bleak Lands for almost a decade and lucky survivor of a
    recent raid had this to say: \"I've seen plenty o' pirates in my time. You don't
    harvest ores in unsafe space and not run into your fair share of despicable folk.
    But the last four expeditions I've been on have been busted up by raids that came
    in blazingly fast and with no warning. This last time had I not had the good sense
    to fit stabilizing arrays for my warp-drive, I and my crew would have bought it
    for sure. As it was we had several compartments on fire by the time we were safely
    away, and twelve good men lost their lives. Something needs to be done soon, or
    all legitimate activity in the area is going to come to a screeching halt.\"   \n
    \ \nThis sentiment is echoed by Holder Lyrvan Kourmos, who holds sizable estates
    and facilities in the Erkinen system. \"In these remote reaches of space, we depend
    on imported goods for our very livelihood. We are far from self-sufficient, and
    given the disruption caused to shipping by the increasingly bold activities of
    these pirates, our situation is becoming dangerously tenuous. The lack of necessary
    replacement parts for our equipment is becoming particularly dire, and threatens
    to shut our production down entirely.\"   \n  \nSince the publication of the Ministry's
    report, the office of the Court Chamberlain has so far declined to comment publicly
    on the issue."
