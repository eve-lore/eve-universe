- body: "Rioting erupted this morning at Truiisu Station, a Kassigainen IV mining
    colony owned by Caldari giant the Kaalakiota Corporation. The exact reasons for
    the fracas are unclear, but the fighting is reported to have broken out in the
    wake of an incident where several officers of the Home Guard, Kaalakiota's private
    police force, allegedly slit the throat of a former colony worker recently laid
    off by the corporation.   \n  \nExact numbers of deceased are unavailable at this
    point, but unconfirmed reports indicate that fierce fighting has been going on
    between former workers and Home Guard forces, with dozens killed so far. Several
    sections of the colony are reported to have suffered complete blackouts, with
    a number of the colony's vital functions running on auxiliary power.   \n  \nThe
    Kaalakiota Corporation at noon today issued a short statement, claiming that outside
    of some \"minor collateral damage,\" the situation was rapidly being brought under
    control. They have declined to comment further on the matter.   \n  \nTruiisu
    Station is a Type-4, partially-subterranean mineral colony with a Class-B sustenance
    dome and reinforced atmospheric generators for use in extreme environments. It
    is currently home to over 1680 people, comprising approximately 1100 Kaalakiota
    workers and their families."
