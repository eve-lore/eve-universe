    Drifters Advance as New Eden Fights Back\nDrifters have escalated their conflict
    across New Eden and beyond as five factions take up occupancy of Drifter wormhole
    systems. These occupational forces have been enabled by new Drifter wormhole filaments
    developed as a result of the recent \u201CRace for the Hives\u201D. These filaments
    rely on remote access to the Warden in Zarzakh and allow groups of ships to move
    into specified Drifter wormholes. \n\nSimultaneously, structural shifts have been
    observed throughout Drifter wormhole systems for the first time in years. The
    previous Drifter complexes have reconfigured into labyrinthine constructs of reconfiguring
    space. Early hyperspace telemetry indicates these complexes only partially exist
    within observable space, with much of their structure extending into higher dimensions.\n\nEven
    more troubling are the newly formed Nexus Points. Once a part of the Drifter complexes,
    these Nexus have separated into their own deadspace pockets. The mysterious structures
    within each Nexus have begun advancing as the linked Labyrinth Complexes iterate
    through their inscrutable machinations.\n\nScientists are at a loss to explain
    exactly what will occur should their advancement go unchallenged, but doomsday
    scenarios have been shared across the cluster. CONCORD has been quick to challenge
    these rumours, stating that whatever the Drifter plans may be, they will take
    some time to come to fruition. Meanwhile, occupying factions are struggling to
    maintain their influence over these systems against the growing Drifter strength.\n\n![Counter

    Azdaja Redoubt\nAn extensive Triglavian force has appeared in J174618, which has
    been given a new system designation. According to CONCORD\u2019s linguistic specialists,
    it is now known as \u201CAzdaja Redoubt\u201D by the occupying forces. The Triglavians
    have set up a \u201CCounter Domain\u201D base of operations and shown a willingness
    to trade with those who have proven themselves against the Drifters. The Scope
    has picked up a broadcast from the Convocation of Triglav in Azdaja Redoubt:\n\n*Reverse-time
    aggression from the Azdaja in forbidden dominance disrupts the Domain of Bujan.
    Recurring-time Azdaja conflict escalates disruption. Narodnya multitude lost.
    Koschoi multiutude lost. Navka multitude lost. Extirpation is the only advanced-time
    state for Ancient Enemy Azdaja.*\n\n*Ancient-Domain allegiances are pravda when
    fitness is proven against Ancient Enemy Azdaja. Augmented Narodnya of proven fitness
    will receive glorification in the Counter Domain. Triumph is the only advanced-time
    context within the Flow of Vyraj.*\n\n![Eyrie](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/4OeFaAZhMa4dyCL3Cr47Jo/43a2eccd623050936e5c3def480bf280/Eyrie.png)\n###
    Conflux Eyrie\n\u201CThey dared attack New Caldari, they dared dishonor our home,
    now they will fall to the might of our great State.\u201D These were the words
    spoken by Chairman Akimaka Saraki as a Caldari Navy  fleet established itself
    within the system formerly known as J200727. The fleet swiftly established the
    Caldari Navy Eyrie, a fortified location that has granted the system a new name,
    \u201CConflux Eyrie\u201D. \n\nThe Caldari Navy detachment also includes a number
    of specialists from the School of Applied Knowledge. These researchers are there
    to gather as much information as they can about the Drifter threat and their enigmatic
    technologies. They have broadcast a request for any items of interest to be brought
    to the Eyrie in exchange for equipment that will help in their war against the
    Drifters.\n\n![Liberated](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/1VzV1ZSHKPLV0M1khwcSsL/8ac4f4677c9f4710d03861eee9381471/Liberated.png)\n###
    Liberated Barbican\nReaching across the tribal divide, Brutor, Siebestor, and
    Thukker tribal chiefs have joined Sanmatar Malateu Shakor in leading a joint task
    force against the Drifters. Setting up base inside the wormhole formerly known
    as J110145, now dubbed \u201CLiberated Barbican\u201D, the Republic Fleet Liberation
    Outpost will act as a base of operation for the Minmatar military. \u201CThe attack
    on Tabbetzur was a crime we will not soon forget,\u201D Sanmatar Shakor informed
    the media at a press conference alongside the tribal chiefs. \u201CThese Tyrants
    and their violence will no longer be tolerated.\n\nThe fleet\u2019s stated operational
    goal is the liberation of the system from Drifter control. In addition, however,
    a number of Republic Security Service teams have joined the Republic Fleet base.
    These secret service operatives have been quiet about their interests, but the
    acquisition of technology is a known goal of the organization.\n\n![MZ Secured](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/7pAHHw5iIwtdPEhd7VyXE3/7c8a69e7403bb5d96c484d9e89b79724/MZ_Secured.png)\n###
    Sentinel MZ\nEDENCOM has declared the system formally designated J055520 an operational
    military zone, codenamed \u201CSentinel MZ\u201D. A specially constructed fleet
    has fortified a position in the system to support those engaged in anti-Drifter
    operations. \n\nProvost Marshal Kasiha Valkanir has called the operation \u201CEDENCOM\u2019s
    boldest offensive since we first faced the Triglavian threat. Our forces are the
    best of the best, with the capsuleer\u2019s aid, I have no doubt we will hold
    the line.\u201D When asked how she felt about fighting on the same side of this
    conflict as the Triglavians, Valkanir was quick to respond, \u201CWe are not,
    nor shall we ever be, on their side. We are on the side of New Eden. If the Drifters
    and Trigs want to blow each other up while we\u2019re busy securing peace for
    our cluster, so be it.\u201D\n\n![Sanctuary](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/2W5z9qT8ylGNIFOLIAdbAe/9cc22a1a2196eb68bd75d12ed33d14a3/Sanctuary.png)\n###
    Sanctified Vidette\nAt a ceremony in J164710, Empress Catiz I herself has sanctified
    the system in the name of the Amarrian faith. During the holy ritual, she renamed
    the system \u201CSanctified Vidette\u201D. The ceremony was celebrated across
    the Amarr Empire as a display of strength against the enemy that committed regicide
    against the Empress' predecessor, Empress Jamyl I. \n\nShortly after it concluded,
    the Empress withdrew back to the Imperial Palace on Amarr Prime. The Imperial
    Navy has completed the construction of a militarized sanctuary on the site of
    her sanctification. In additional to its military contingent, members of the Imperial
    Academy and representatives from the Theological Council have taken up residency.
    According to official reports, these groups will be reviewing any findings from
    the conflict with the Drifters for potential value to the Empire as well as religious
    implications.\n\n### News in Brief\n- Angel Cartel accused of further raids on
    Amarr research centers despite Imperial victory in Race for the Hives.\n\n- Spikes
    in hyperspace traffic around the Warden detected as Drifter structures reconfigure.\n\n-
    Intaki Bank reports record year as investors seek safety from war time scrutiny.\n\n-
    Deathless Circle in turmoil as operatives scramble to intercept remote Warden
    access.\n\n- Senate calls for Race for the Hives inquiry narrowly defeated by
    Progressive Party loyalists.\n\n- Brutor Tribe condemns Republic Fleet deal to
    share technology with EDENCOM operations in Sentinel MZ."
