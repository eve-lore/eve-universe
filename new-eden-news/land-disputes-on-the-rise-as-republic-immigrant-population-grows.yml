- body: 'Pator - Increasing numbers of land disputes are being registered as the Minmatar
    Republic immigrant population rises, confirmed Urban Management, the independent
    land and estates administration agency for the Republic, in a press statement
    today. Johanas Dhirakior, Urban Management''s Planning Director on Matar, also
    admitted that disputes which normally would be settled with relative ease at the
    local level were increasingly being referred to the agency for arbitration.


    Director Dhirakior was speaking at a press conference called following a recent
    leak of Urban Management statistics which showed a four-fold increase in land
    disputes over the last six months. Among the leaked figures is a table correlating
    the rise in the immigrant population with the rise in numbers of dispute cases
    and the time taken to settle them. Additionally, many of the disputes are between
    tribal clans and the Republic government, relating to both the government''s ''transit
    camps'' and the permanent resettlement of immigrants on ''unused land.''


    The ''Elder Fleet'' incursion into the Amarr Empire in June and the slave emancipation
    edict of Amarr Empress Jamyl I in December both led to significant increases in
    the number and size of the camps. Large numbers of former slaves have been arriving
    in the Republic since the middle of last year, with the rate of immigration yet
    to show signs of significantly slowing down. On many Minmatar planets large tracts
    of unused land nominally under tribal control have been utilised by the Minmatar
    government on the basis of ''national need.'' This government action appears to
    have led to a flurry of claims requiring arbitration by Urban Management.


    Director Dhirakior would not be drawn on the status of individual disputes, citing
    confidentiality and pointing out that the resolution of all disputes becomes a
    matter of public record once a decision has been taken.'
