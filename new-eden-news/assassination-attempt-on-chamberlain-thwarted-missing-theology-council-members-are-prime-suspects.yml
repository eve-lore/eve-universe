    to announce a thwarted assassination attempt on his life, and implicate the missing
    Theology Council justices as being directly responsible for the act. A public
    address to the empire is expected by Chamberlain Karsoth later today. \n\nSources
    close to the chancellor confirmed that the conspiracy was spearheaded by Lord
    Falek Grange, and \u201Ccoordinated in large part\u201D under the direction of
    Lords Victor Eliade and Aulus Gord. Sophisticated, sensor-evading bomb producing
    materials were smuggled into the Emperor Family Academy Station through a network
    of individuals working directly for the three justices, thus implicating numerous
    Theology Council staff. As such, a \u201Cpurge\u201D of these individuals has
    been executed by Imperial Paladins, although the source would not elaborate further.
    \n\nThe Imperial Navy confirmed that search and destroy operations are underway,
    and that the presence of naval warships in the Sakht System was due to its importance
    as the last system the three fugitives were seen in. Believed to have crossed
    the border, the Navy has not ruled out the possibility that their escape was aided
    by Blood Raiders, but reiterated that the motivations of Grange, Eliade, and Victor
    have not been specifically tied to the cult\u2014at least not yet. \n\nImperial
    forces, in particular Paladins under the command of the Ministry of Internal Order,
    have imposed draconian security measures in light of the assassinations of two
    emperors in recent memory. Sweeping reform enacted by Chamberlain Karsoth shortly
    after the late Emperor, Doriam II\u2019s death awarded the Paladins with additional
    search and seizure powers, which include prompt \u201Cguilt by holy witness\u201D
    judgments if crimes are caught in the act by \u201Cordained representatives of
    Amarr.\u201D \n\nA full transcript of Chamberlain Karsoth\u2019s address will
    be available following his announcement."
