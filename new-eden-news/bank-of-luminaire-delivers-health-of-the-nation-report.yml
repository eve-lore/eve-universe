- body: "The Bank of Luminaire yesterday released its much-anticipated report into
    the economic 'health of the nation', as termed by an ever-growing number of media
    sources. This report has been much hyped within the Federation by both the media
    and politicians, drawing much attention to divided opinions on the stability of
    the nations sustained economic growth. Given the attention lavished on the subject
    in the run up to publishing the report the extensive analysis of its contents
    has come as little surprise. \n\nWhile many voices have been eager to point out
    the continued successes of Gallente industry in recent months, many of the good
    news stories have been overshadowed by a string of alleged potential crises looming
    on the horizon. In depth analysis of the report has drawn attention to irregularities
    and speculations of brewing trouble at no less than three of the Federation's
    major economic establishments. \n\nThe first story to break has been that of Combined
    Harvest, the largest food producer within Federation borders. In recent years
    Combined Harvest have been known to pursue an aggressive investment policy to
    massively expand their production capacities. The rationale provided by Combined
    Harvest spokespersons at the time was that the company was moving to claim a larger
    market share of domestic food production in the wake of a booming population.
    It now appears however that Combined Harvest's predicted growth may have been
    overly optimistic. Competing against Amarrian imports is suggested to have proven
    more difficult than expected, thus leaving Combined Harvest with a surplus in
    production and a potentially failing investment. \n\nThis story was closely followed
    by a revelation springing forth from a technology sector analyst who claims to
    have uncovered a 'significant' discrepancy in the public accounts of CreoDron,
    the famous remote drone manufacturer. This story has been picked up by the majority
    of financial media networks across the Federation and has led to wild theory following
    stern accusation that CreoDron are hiding an embarrassment from both the public
    and their investors. There is as yet no firm information available other than
    the original analysts findings indicating that; \"The numbers [in the public accounts]
    simply don't add up.\". Conjecture abounds as to what the truth behind the numbers
    may be but as yet CreoDron remain tight-lipped and have declined comment. \n\nPerhaps
    as a result of these two high profile embarrassments of leading Federation companies,
    the eye of critics has begun to turn towards the Garoun Investment bank. Pundits
    have begun to question investment practices of Garoun claiming that the bank has
    been reckless with it's recent investments into 'risky' enterprises that could
    easily fail should the economy indeed begin to slow. Further speculation has sprung
    up drawing links between loans and invested monies in both Combined Harvest and
    CreoDron and the possible failing of both ventures. \n\nWhile hard fact can be
    difficult to find amongst widespread speculation the uproar has thus far all but
    drowned out the many claims of sustained economic growth in many industry sectors.
    As one pundit is quoted; \"Is this just a blip or the first symptoms of the economic
    boom loosing its thunder? I sure can't call it yet.\"."
