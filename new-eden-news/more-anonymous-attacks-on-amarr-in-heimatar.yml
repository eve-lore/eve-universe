- body: "It was revealed that more civilian Amarr ships were destroyed earlier today
    within the borders of Republic space under fire from unidentified armed vessels.
    The first report of the incident was made by capsuleer and miner Nedal Hegoth
    who quickly posted on GalNet to state that he witnessed the incident in a remote
    part of the Dammalin system while scouting for mineral resources.\n\n\u201CI counted
    six Amarr vessels stationed near the belt,\u201D he said.\u201D I\u2019m not sure
    why they were there but none of them were fitted for mining. The next thing I
    know a squadron of Rifters blistering with canons warps and blows them to smithereens.
    It was all over in less than a minute. The attackers had no insignia and no active
    transponders so I couldn\u2019t tell who they were, and they warped straight out
    again without hanging around. I\u2019m just glad they didn\u2019t spot me hiding
    on the other side of the belt or I\u2019m sure they would\u2019ve taken me out
    too.\u201D\n\nShortly after this account started circulating Republic authorities
    issued the following statement: \u201CWe regret to announce that local patrols
    have identified the wreckage of a number of Amarr mercantile vessels in the Dammalin
    system. It is too early for us to determine the cause or the motives for their
    destruction but we would like to assure all of our citizens and any visitors from
    neighbouring empires that we are taking the matter very seriously and that we
    will do our utmost to bring the perpetrators of this act to justice.\u201D\n\nIn
    many quarters however people are beginning to questions these assurances. Similar
    promises were made in response to the [attack recorded two weeks ago](http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=2009&tid=3)
    in the Osoggur system, and the same sentiments have been repeated on numerous
    occasions in regards to the guerilla war still being fought by the Defiants and
    their militia allies in the Bleak Lands. In fact, if rumours are to be believed,
    rogue militia groups are now launching their attacks from bases inside the Republic's
    borders. Last week General Saracen of the Amarrian 7th Fleet questioned the Republic's
    stance on these issues, and the Amarr government subsequently issued an official
    warning to Prime Minister Midular regarding the apparent lack of progress in bringing
    these rogue militia under control. Many now feel that the Republic's leaders need
    to take a more hard-line approach before the situation deteriorates any further.\n\n\u201CIt
    is about time that the Republic changed the record,\u201D said Maldor Doran, patriarch
    of Sarum scion House Doran, when questioned by the press in response to this latest
    statement. \u201CIf they cannot bring the rabble in their domain under their heel
    then perhaps they should seek the advice and aid of those with greater accomplishment
    and experience. In Amarr troublemakers such as these would have been apprehended
    within days.\u201D\n\nMany within the Republic have however not taken this criticism
    lightly. \u201CIt is insulting to think that we are incapable of taking care of
    our own affairs,\u201D said Republic Security Services Captain Xalabor Jhor in
    a recent RSS bulletin. \u201CWe are simply taking the time to gather the appropriate
    evidence and corroborate the testimony of witnesses. Unlike other cultures we
    do not condemn the innocent until they are proven guilty, nor do we parade our
    criminal investigations before the public eye for the entertainment of the masses.
    These issues will be resolved in good time, and we simply ask for a little patience.\u201D\n\nExactly
    how much patience the Republic\u2019s detractors have left remains to be seen."
