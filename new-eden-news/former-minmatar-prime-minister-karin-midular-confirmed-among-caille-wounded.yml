- body: 'Karin Midular, current Sebiestor Tribal Chief and former Prime Minister of
    the Minmatar Republic, has been confirmed as one of those wounded in the terrorist
    attack that took place at the hands of a lone gunman earlier today on Gallente
    Prime. Details are sparse at this hour, but reports indicate the tribal chief
    is currently in critical condition after sustaining a serious head wound in the
    attack.


    According to highly placed sources within the Minmatar government, Sanmatar Malaetu
    Shakor has been in direct contact with Federation President Jacus Roden, making
    a strongly worded demand that the shooter be extradited to the Minmatar Republic
    for questioning and trial. The same sources indicate that the President''s response
    was negative, citing internal investigation and damage control at home as the
    primary reasons.


    No details pertaining to the gunman''s identity have been released yet, though
    unconfirmed reports indicate that he is of ethnic Gallente origin. His political
    or organizational affiliations, if any, are unknown at this time. He is reportedly
    being held and questioned by Caille authorities in preparation for transfer to
    an undisclosed governmental facility.


    Protests and rioting have broken out in various cities across the Minmatar Republic,
    with dissenters calling for Midular to be sent home immediately along with the
    gunman. Midular''s status as a Ray of Matar, a position of rarified cultural and
    spiritual significance to the Minmatar, is believed to account in large part for
    the extraordinarily rapid escalation of national anger.


    Representatives of the Sebiestor Tribe were unavailable for comment, though the
    tribe this afternoon sent out a release expressing shock at the state of affairs
    while urging "tribal brothers and sisters, as well as all of our national brethren
    everywhere, to remain resilient in the face of this great and senseless evil."'
