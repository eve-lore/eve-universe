    - Quafe Company shares dropped today on the major Caldari exchanges following
    a petition to the Chief Executive Panel by the Caldari Providence Directorate
    to revoke the Gallente firm's State-granted corporate status.\n\nCiting Quafe's
    ties to the Federation and its government, the Directorate's petition states Quafe's
    unique status as the only non-Caldari corporation with domestic corporate sovereignty
    and its attendant rights pose an \"insidious economic and political threat to
    the stability of the Caldari State.\"\n\nThe CEP tabled consideration of the petition
    after initial discussions failed to reach a consensus. Sukuuvestaa Corporation
    in particular seemed opposed. \"Quafe is an integral part of the State's economy,\"
    said Sirotova Uesi, CFO for the megacorporation. \"Gallente or not, suddenly revoking
    their status could have undesirable consequences.\"\n\nAgencourt Ambrulle, Chief
    Coordinator of Public Relations for Quafe, disagrees with Ms. Uesi's comments.
    \"We currently employ millions of hard-working Caldari citizens [in the State],
    none of whom would be pleased with, for example, wage loss due to State injunction.\"\n\nIn
    regards to the CPD's position that Quafe is a liability, Ambrulle stated, \"Quafe
    is not an organ of the Federal government, nor do we act on its behalf.\""
