    Pator - With Minmatar politicians and tribal leaders looking ahead to the upcoming
    tribal assembly, the news of Mens Reppola''s appointment as the new CEO of Ishukone
    corporation was given a cautious welcome by most, including senior figures in
    the Minmatar military. Under the late Otro Gariushi, Ishukone was seen by Minmatar
    leaders as a progressive force within the Caldari State, despite a complicated,
    and at times murky, history of political and economic engagement between Ishukone
    corporation and the Minmatar Republic.


    As a close colleague of Gariushi, and given his commitment to honoring the legacy
    of his late friend, Mens Reppola seems likely to be given a grace period by senior
    figures in the political and military classes, and may even be seen by some as
    a hopeful figure. A significant faction within the Minmatar political and military
    classes - increasingly overlapping as tribal power reasserts itself within the
    Republic - regard the formal state of war between the Minmatar Republic and the
    Caldari State as counter to the interests of the tribes.


    "Listen, Gariushi was no paragon, and Ishukone is a Caldari megacorp when all
    is said and done, but place them next to Heth and the Provists, and the contrast
    is there," commented Commander Agdelger Ruflaner of the Brutor Tribe security
    forces. "I feel this man Reppola should be welcomed to his new position and given
    time to set his stamp on things. Then we will see if change is possible as regards
    the State and the Republic." An aide to Sanmatar Shakor refused to speculate on
    any alteration in the diplomatic situation, referring inquiries on the war to
    the Tribal Liberation Force command.'
