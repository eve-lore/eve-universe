- body: "In recent days, Concord conflict-nets have logged a sharp increase of disturbing
    distress calls in the depths of what has until recently been viewed as the most
    highly secured sectors of Eve. Merchant vessels and corporate military patrols
    alike are heard pleading briefly for all assistance before being cut short by
    the telltale static of electronic jamming \u2013 these unfortunate vessels are
    usually never found or heard from again. The attention of corporate defence forces,
    usually focused squarely on the pirate-infested outer fringes of civilization,
    is now turning to this new and little-known threat in the very heart of the known
    galaxy.   \n  \nBelieved to utilize coordinated swarm tactics and advanced electronic
    warfare weaponry, as well as considerable external funding, these bold marauders
    seem to have somehow circumvented the Concord security measures set in place to
    protect the citizens of the four empires \u2013 whether by bribery or corruption,
    it is unclear how these cutthroats manage to pass undetected. All that is certain
    is that the daily death toll from their attacks is mounting, and to date no one
    has stood toe-to-toe with this cruel and elusive criminal group known only as
    the \u201CBlack Monkeys\u201D. Corporate officials have not yet been available
    to comment on this new and growing threat to intergalactic safety.   \n  \nWe
    will provide you with more information as it becomes available."
