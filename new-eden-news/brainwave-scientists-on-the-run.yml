- body: "Last Thursday night saw another unsuccessful raid on the labs of the much
    debated \u2018Brainwave control\u2019 scientists Albert Vance and Vic Stats.   \n
    \ \nAs with the previous raid - the laboratories had been evacuated well before
    the arrival of the three Caldari agents, who have been pursuing the controversial
    scientists since the nature of their research was uncovered a fortnight ago.   \n
    \ \nThe scientists are believed to have removed much of their equipment and left
    no clues as to their next destination, leaving the investigators little option
    but to appeal for information from local capsuleers.   \n  \nDuring this time
    Vance and Stats were sighted in an Amarrian FTL channel procuring more electronic
    parts. Moments after their courier arrived, the Caldari investigators are reported
    to have entered the channel apparently acting on a tip off.   \n  \nAfter embarking
    on a furious debate on the ethics behind Vance\u2019s work, the scientist is said
    to have become incensed with the agents and stormed out of the channel, closely
    followed by his colleague Dr Stats.   \n  \nThough not officially confirmed, their
    pursuers are believed to be applying for a search warrant with the Amarrian authorities
    in preparation for a raid on the researcher\u2019s new labs."
