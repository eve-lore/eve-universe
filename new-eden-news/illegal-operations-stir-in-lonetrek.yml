- body: "Earlier this week, word started to trickle through the criminal underground
    in the Lonetrek region, that an as yet unnamed Gallente corporation is making
    preparations to buy large amounts of contraband goods for what is rumoured to
    be a drastic new research project.   \n  \nMany of the universes worst drugs,
    as well as slaves are thought to be on the list of desired contraband. When and
    were the items will be purchased, and for how much is something that the rumours
    have as yet failed to deliver.   \n  \nConcord has warned anyone in that region
    that dealing in contraband is highly illegal. Anyone caught with illegal goods
    will be dealt with to the full extent of the law. They went on to advise anyone
    who finds contraband items to trash them or report to the authorities.   \n  \nWhether
    this warning has had any effect is up for dispute but in the last few days there
    has been a small increase in violent crime, both in and out of space stations
    in Lonetrek."
