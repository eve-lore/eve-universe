    Unshrouded Warden Accelerates Deathless Innovations\nSources inside Zarzakh have
    confirmed that the \u201CShrouded Structure\u201D is no longer shrouded. Deathless
    Circle researchers were able to bring the ancient Jovian remnant online and out
    of cloak shortly after 11:00 today. Deathless operatives have been quick to establish
    research teams inside what they are now calling \u201CThe Warden\u201D.\n\nThis
    un-shrouding follows over a month of investigations into artifacts known as Atavum
    by the Circle. Atavum are ancient relics left behind by Jovian explorers. A large
    number were delivered by capsuleer collaborators to a research facility in Zarzakh
    at the Deathless' request. Though they are no longer fully functional they still
    exert pressure on local spacetime, providing insight into how ancient Jovian technology
    operates. These investigations appear to have borne fruit with their unlocking
    of The Warden.\n\nMultiple sources have informed the Scope that the structure\u2019s
    secrets have already aided the Deathless Circle in making advances in a number
    of different fields. New Deathless ships are believed to be in development. These
    ships are capable of fitting breacher pod launchers that include the infrastructure
    needed to run small virtualities. These virtualities can house a team of infomorphs
    who then transfer to clone bodies launched in SCARAB Breacher Pods. Dubbed \u201CShriker
    clones\u201D, they are a specialized iteration of the Upwell Consortium's workforce
    clones. It has been suggested that Shriker clones were developed with the assistance
    of Dr. Esme Moreno. A former Chemal Tech geneticist working on Upwell workforce
    clones, Dr. Moreno joined the Deathless Circle following her delivery to the Fulcrum
    by a capsuleer agent. Little is known about the completed Shriker genome, but
    it is believed that they feature greatly improved biological facilities in exchange
    for a significantly reduced lifespan. This reduced lifespan would not impact the
    longevity of any occupying infomorph, only their time inside a Shriker body.\n\nSimultaneously
    with The Warden\u2019s reveal, the Society of Conscious Thought has reported observing
    minor shifts or \u201Cripples\u201D in spacetime across New Eden. These ripples
    quickly stabilized, but Idemi Sver, CEO of the SOCT, has expressed his concern;
    \u201CThe original purpose of this structure remains a mystery, but its powerful
    potential is evident. We cannot trust such an incredible artifact to the whims
    of irreverent criminals such as the Deathless Circle.\u201D\n\n![Merc Den](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/5s3sJgkGWPJOtmeWl4fDRe/94656d3f8556e49c4b8e55d565a0c393/mercDen.png)\n###
    Upwell Outraged but Unshaken by \u201CParasitic\u201D Deathless\nSchematics have
    been leaked for a new \u201CMercenary Den\u201D structure designed by the Deathless
    Circle to attach to Upwell\u2019s Orbital Skyhooks. These structures vary internally
    and their internal spaces appear to serve many purposes; from meeting places for
    the Circle\u2019s less-than-legal associates, to recreational facilities for Upwell
    workforce members. All dens, however, feature TEBS (Transneural Echo Burn Scanner)
    facilities as standard. This suggests that the Deathless is embarking on an aggressive
    campaign of infomorph recruitment specifically targeting Upwell workforces.\n\nThe
    Upwell Consortium has consistently reported high satisfaction numbers amongst
    workforce members. Nonetheless, Deathless Circle agents seem confident that some
    workers are unhappy with their situation and are looking for a way out of their
    contracts. Given the size of the TEBS facilities, it can be inferred that the
    Circle expects a large number of enthusiastic applicants. A fraction of those
    recruited will undoubtedly work as the Deathless' new Shriker clones, but the
    numbers involved imply that most will work elsewhere in the organization.\n\nIn
    response, the Upwell Consortium has issued a statement saying that \u201CThese
    parasitic Mercenary Dens are a clear violation of Upwell property. We urge any
    capsuleers who make use of Equinox infrastructure to terminate any attempts to
    anchor a den to their Orbital Skyhooks. Furthermore, workforce members are free
    to leave their employment at any time. Though we are sure that given time, workforce
    members will discover there is a place for everyone in the Upwell Dream, we freely
    allow workforce members to quit the program.\u201D \n\nWhile this may be true,
    examining the Upwell workforce standard contract reveals that those who seek to
    prematurely terminate their employment contracts are liable for the cost of their
    Upwell cloning and consciousness transfer, as well as the new body they wish to
    be transferred to and a final consciousness transfer into that body. The cost
    of these services is high enough to be prohibitive for most workforce members
    and in practice many may have no choice but to serve out their contracts regardless.
    \n\nDED Star Marshal Kjersidur Elladall has expressed concern that \u201Cthose
    lured by the promise of a brighter future might prefer the prospect of a life
    of adventure with the Deathless over the reality of lawful labor in Upwell facilities.\u201D
    He went on to express concerns over the potential impact on the cluster of a large
    influx of Circle members. Upwell has dismissed these concerns, and insists that
    the Merc Dens are \u201Ca scam designed to undermine morale. Though there is no
    reason for any workforce member to desire to break their contract, unique encryption
    protocols are in place on all workforce infomorphs that prohibit remote consciousness
    transfers or re-embodiment without Upwell oversight. No known decryption technology
    is capable of bypassing these protections.\u201D\n\n### News in Brief\n- EDENCOM
