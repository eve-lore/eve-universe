- body: 'Anttiri - Perkone, one of the major Caldari manufacturing corporations, announced
    their intention to conduct a secondary share offering in an effort to raise as
    much as 30 billion ISK. Economic experts view this move as an indication that
    the Caldari economy is on the rise.


    Kakanen Maloras, Perkone''s CFO, said that the company intends to "aggressively
    pursue opportunities presented by the current economic and business conditions."
    He added that Perkone will use the proceeds of the capital increase to "continue
    improving the quality of its production facilities and take advantage of potential
    opportunities to expand its core business, including the funding of potential
    asset acquisitions and participation in joint ventures."


    The offering will be priced at a 12.5% discount to the current share price. The
    company''s existing shareholders will have the right to purchase the new shares
    before they are made available to the public. Hyasoda Corporation, Perkone''s
    controlling shareholder, are expected to execute its rights in full.


    Analysts link the move to the Caldari-Amarr Economic Stimulus Agreement, a recent
    initiative of Empress Jamyl I. "The CAESA investment package was bound to have
    far-reaching effects in the Caldari State due to its sheer size," said Rani Tilam,
    head analyst for SarumGlobal, an Amarr investment fund. "Initially, there were
    concerns about its usefulness, but the long-awaited increase in the confidence
    of State businesses demonstrates that the money was not been spent in vain."


    The meetings between Perkone management and investors are expected to begin today.'
