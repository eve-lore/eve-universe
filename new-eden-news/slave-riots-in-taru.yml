- body: "Last night a riot is rumoured to have occurred in a slave holding facility
    somewhere within the Taru system. It\u2019s believed the facility where the alleged
    riot occured is owned by Korramasha Mawhi, a small time slave trader with no record
    of illegal activities. Solid evidence has been hard to come by, but four ships
    in Korramasha\u2019s possession, including two Zealots and two Sacrileges were
    seen being piloted by four Matari personel heading towards Minmatar space.   \n
    \ \nThese ships were intercepted and destroyed by two Amarr pilots believed to
    be employed by Mawhi. When asked why Concord didn't intervene, the Amarr Navy
    said that it was a purely civil matter which put it under the Navys duristiction,
    and not Concords. They declined to comment on any further details of the incident."
