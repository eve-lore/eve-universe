- body: 'Hek, Metropolis - Hek Extractions and Aggregates (HEXAG) has announced plans
    for a large off-planet mining installation in the Hek system. Long a force in
    quarrying and open-cast mining on the core worlds of the Republic, HEXAG has recently
    diversified into mineral surveying and extraction on moons and other bodies. The
    announcement of this extensive new operation in Hek follows the successful establishment
    of a number of smaller mining installations throughout the Metropolis region.
    HEXAG has confirmed that a moon will be the target for the new venture, with bulk
    extraction of minerals not readily accessible through orbital mining techniques
    the primary goal.


    The HEXAG announcement chimes with market reports indicating increased demand
    for minerals and refined products within the planetary industrial base of the
    Republic. With extraction opportunities limited on many planets by tribal territorial
    considerations the expansion of the traditional mining sector into the exploitation
    of moons and orbital bodies is seen as a natural response to the upswing in demand.
    HEXAG have also announced that their new installation and further planned operations
    will create many new jobs in the industry. A recruitment drive is underway for
    skilled workers with particular emphasis on the Minmatar diaspora in the Gallente
    Federation.'
