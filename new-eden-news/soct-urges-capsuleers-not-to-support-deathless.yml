    SOCT Responds to Deathless Request for Atavum\nThe SOCT has issued an official
    message to all capsuleers in response to the Deathless' recent request for Atavum.
    Mysterious devices left behind by ancient Jovian explorers, Atavum have been discovered
    in relic sites all across New Eden and wormhole space. Idmei Sver, CEO of the
    Society, urges pilots to bring their Atavum to Society of Conscious Thought stations
    in FDZ4-A instead of delivering them into Deathless hands. Here is the message
    in full:\n\n*To the Capsuleers of New Eden.*\n\n*We have always strived to foster
    a deeper understanding of our universe and preserve humanity\u2019s path to a
    more enlightened future, regardless of creed or country. Since the withdrawal
    of our patrons from the Third Jovian Empire, we have not wavered from this mission.
    But not all paths lead to enlightenment. There are corruptors in our world whose
    only goal is to spread misrule and thrust us into darkness.* \n\n*The so-called
    \u201CDeathless\u201D is one such agent, and he seeks to consume and foul the
    pure technologies of the ancient Jove, technologies that are our shared legacy.
    Take for example the Fulcrum he resides in. Once a silent monolith to a long-lost
    past, it has been perverted into a den of iniquity. Now he demands these Atavum
    so he can squander the history they represent and pervert them to his base purposes.*\n\n*We
    at the Society wish only to protect and preserve these ancient treasures so that
    their secrets might be used responsibly. I implore you, bold empyreans, to bring
    any Atavum you discover to the Society instead. You will be fairly compensated
    for your deliveries and can be at peace knowing they will be safely stored far
    from any ill intent. We trust that you, whose new lives were built on secrets
    shared by our former patrons, will do what is right for New Eden.*\n\nThe message
    came in response to reports of capsuleers trading in Atavum at a research station
    beside the recently discovered shrouded structure in Zarzakh. At this research
    station, the Deathless Circle has been passing out upgraded combat probes, relic
    analyzer and implant blueprint copies, and valuable honorarium in exchange for
    Atavum. Inside sources have indicated that the Circle intends to study these Atavum
    in order to learn how to unlock the mysterious structure. Given their past association
    with criminal organizations, the Scope is awaiting further confirmation of these
    reports.\n\n### Journals and Atavum Buy Orders\nThe SOCT has issued buy orders
    in their FDZ4-A stations, offering compensation to anyone who delivers Atavum
    to their archives. They have also extended this offer to include old journal data
    that has also been discovered recently in relic sites. \n\nThese journals were
    penned by a former member of the SOCT. Speaking on behalf of the Society Idmei
    Sver stated that they would be \u201Cgrateful for the timely recovery of any information
    this member of our Society left behind.\u201D According to him as the journals
    were made by a member of their organization, they are SOCT property.\n\n### News
