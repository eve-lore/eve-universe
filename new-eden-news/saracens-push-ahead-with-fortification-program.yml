- body: "Myyhera, The Bleak Lands - In a news release earlier today, Admiral Saracen
    of the Amarr Navy 7th Fleet stated, \u201CGod\u2019s peace is settling in The
    Bleak Lands, as the 7th Fleet is progressing its fortifications apace and have
    secured all key systems. Our next major task is to upgrade all communication relays
    in the region to support Amarr Navy standards, which will be carried out today.
    After that completion we will have reached our main objectives for this phase
    of the operation.\u201D   \n  \nThe 7th Fleet\u2019s presence in the region has
    continued to ensure that supply and military convoys travel uninterrupted into
    the region, showing signs that The Bleak Lands is becoming liberated from pirate
    influence. Navy patrols become more common each passing day, and there has yet
    to be any more reported incidents of attacks on slave pens.   \n  \nWhile initially
    thought to have been perpetrated by pirates or Blood Raiders, recent investigations
    into the raids have revealed none of the characteristics traditionally associated
    with such organizations. These reports have prompted the Admiral to order his
    personal staff to head up a detailed analysis into the true origins of these attacks.
    \  \n  \nThe Bleak Lands communication relays are due to be taken offline as of
    11:45 Standard EVE Time and should return to full operations shortly after."
