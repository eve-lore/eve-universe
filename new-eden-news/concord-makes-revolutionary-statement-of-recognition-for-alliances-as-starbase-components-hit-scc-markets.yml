    Inner Circle, declared CONCORD to be in full official support of the outer rim
    alliances. Further, she stated that official provision had been made for alliances
    to, for the first time in history, become recorded entities on the level of nation-states.
    \ \u201CThe last two weeks have been a tumultuous time, with nations, institutions,
    organizations, even families, split down the middle in disagreement,\u201D said
    Angireh. \u201CThusly, in fulfillment of the duties bestowed upon us by our position,
    CONCORD has made a decision. As of this moment, an official CONCORD-sanctioned
    Alliance register has been put into effect. Those political entities which comply
    with our criteria may, from now, be recognized for the powers they are. Additionally,
    the SCC has made no provision to restrict the ORE Syndicate\u2019s retailing of
    moon mining and starbase technologies, technologies which we feel will do nothing
    but expand humanity\u2019s frontiers and speed our path into the future.\u201D
    \ The news has sent shockwaves through the political community. Representatives
    from the four empires have logged official complaints through all available channels,
    some even going so far as to claim CONCORD has overstepped its bounds completely
    and that the Inner Circle has been corrupted by the interests of the cloning and
    spaceship industries, as well as pressure from vocal capsuleer groups through
    GalNet feed channels.  \u201CMark my words, this is the beginning of the end,\u201D
    stated Amarr Court Chamberlain Proconsul Camoul Hinda. \u201CWith people like
    these allowed access to that level of advanced technology, there\u2019s no telling
    what will happen. It seems to me that CONCORD is acting purely out of self-interest,
    with no concern for the economic well-being of the nations it was created to protect.\u201D
    \ \u201CIt\u2019s like a bad dream. I just don\u2019t know what to say,\u201D
    said Gallente senator Aubrille Dramou. \u201CIt\u2019s like they took a touch
    sculpture, detached all the constituent parts and just threw the pieces back into
    the field randomly. I\u2019m not even sure I want to know what happens next.\u201D
    \ Meanwhile, outer rim alliance leaders have expressed approval of CONCORD\u2019s
    move. Fountain Alliance representative TornSoul in an interview this afternoon
    stated, \u201CThe core empires need to wake up to the fact that there are other
    powerful entities in existence, and they need to start dealing with these entities
    on equal terms. They should realize there is something to be learned from those
    who have been able to do what they could not \u2013 namely, establish permanent
    footholds in the outer regions. While the FA welcomes this move from CONCORD,
    it is really nothing more than a formalization of the current de facto state of
    affairs -- we're here, and we're here to stay.\u201D"
