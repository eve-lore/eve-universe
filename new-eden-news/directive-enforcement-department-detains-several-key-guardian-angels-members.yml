    individuals believed to be members of the leadership of the Guardian Angels and
    Serpentis Corporation''s narcotics distribution network.


    Security has remained tight around the unknown number of detainees, who are rumoured
    to be key links in the narcotics trade in the regions of Solitude, Aridia, Syndicate
    Placid and Delve.


    The undisclosed number of prisoners, believed to be in the region of fifteen individuals,
    were escorted to DED headquarters in orbit of Yulai X by a flotilla of CONCORD
    vessels, before being transferred to a detention center on the icy surface of
    the planet.


    In a statement following the operation, DED Director of Operations Arve Vesren

    wanted for narcotics and human trafficking related offenses."'
