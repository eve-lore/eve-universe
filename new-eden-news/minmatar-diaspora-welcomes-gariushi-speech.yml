    their wholehearted support for the speech urging calm made by Ishukone CEO Otro
    Gariushi, and have in turn urged calm and restraint on any Minmatar living and
    working in the Gallente Federation or the Caldari State.\n\nKillian Thakor, leader
    of the Minmatar Community Alliance, said, \"It is essential that our people, here
    in the homelands, and in the Federation and State, behave with restraint and not
    become swept up in any rash movements that seek to attack one ethnicity or another.
    We of the MCA know what a welcoming environment the Federation has provided for
    many of our brothers and sisters. We also know of the opportunities that can be
    found in the Caldari State. Every Minmatar should heed the wise words of Otro
    Gariushi.\"\n\nReports from Minmatar living in the Gallente Federation have been
    muted for fear of reprisals but it is known that some of the violence in the Federation
    spilled into areas where Minmatar and Caldari live in fairly close proximity.
    These have tended to be poorer areas where immigrants predominate. However, there
    have been sporadic tales of Minmatar rioting alongside Gallente as well as Minmatar
    choosing to shield Caldari in fear of their lives. The complexities of the situation
    in the multi-ethnic Gallente Federation are highlighted by such stories.\n\nThakor
    described to us the palpable sense of relief that he has found when speaking to
    Minmatar community leaders in the Federation following the vigils for peace and,
    particularly, the impact of the Gariushi speech. \"I have real hope that the worst
    is now over. We must trust that Gariushi and the ideals he represents will temper
    the passions and, in my opinion, misdirected energies of Tibus Heth. There is
    surely room for a balance here.\" Thakor indicated that the priority for Minmatar
    in the Federation now is to concentrate on relief for any Minmatar displaced by
    the violence and to work to support tolerance of all races."
