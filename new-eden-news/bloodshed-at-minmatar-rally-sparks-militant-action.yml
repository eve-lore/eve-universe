- body: "As was previously reported, last Sunday saw the Mass gathering of hundreds
    of Minmatar pilots and sympathisers around the Matari home planet of Matar in
    the Pator system. Whilst this rally, a protest against the enslavement of a third
    of the Minmatar race and the legal trade of such slaves even within their own
    borders, was intended to be peaceful it was marred by sporadic fighting and bloodshed.
    \  \n  \nThe first casualty was Dragon Ramirez, who was killed at the hands of
    a fellow Minmatar because of a war between their corporations. Outrage flowed
    at this action, pilots all shouting \u201CIf we cannot even act peacefully with
    each other, what hope do we have for freeing out people?\u201D   \n  \nThe unity
    and peaceful nature was once again strained when the Archangels showed up to perform
    their, still unclear, tests in the solar system. The protesters managed to retain
    cool heads and not a shot was fired.   \n  \nThe final spark, however, came when
    Amarr Loyalist corporations PIE and AMAX arrived en masse at the demonstration.
    They proceeded to attack the attending pilots with which they were at war.   \n
    \ \nThis attack on an attempted peaceful protest has fuelled the fire of an already
    volatile hatred between the Minmatar freedom fighters and Amarrian loyalists.
    The Minmatar have sworn vengeance and have called upon all pod-pilots who sympathise
    with their cause to help them attack Amarr slaver convoys this coming Sunday,
    in an attack hoped to span a great number of the Empires systems.   \n  \nKhaldorn
    Murino, a Minmatar freedom fighter from the FU2 corporation, who is very vocal
    about his opinions in this conflict said, _\u201CWe had hoped the demonstration
    would at least merit a response from our government, we cannot seem to achieve
    much by peaceful demonstration. We hope to send a clear message to all the nations
    of EVE that we will not stand by while a third of our entire race remains enslaved
    to the Amarrians. CONCORD and the Empires turn a blind eye to our peoples suffering,
    even my own officials seems to not to care and allows slavery to continue within
    its borders. I urge all freedom loving citizens to lobby their governments, we
    are pod pilots are the elite of our nations, we must make our voices heard._ \u201D
    \  \n  \nThe Amarr however have been very vocal in the public arena, defending
    their actions, claiming that the Minmatar \u201Cfreedom fighters\u201D are no
    more than terrorists with double standards. Hardin, spokesperson for PIE has continually
    made reference to the fact that Masuat\u2019aa Matari, a freedom fighter corporation,
    have been known to attack pilots with standings of +2.0 or greater towards the
    Amarr Empire, regardless of race or intention. Whilst they have not denied these
    claims, they have said that anyone found supporting the empire will be dealt with
    unless they explain the reasons behind their standings.   \n  \nNo-matter what
    the facts are, and what disagreements fuel the pilot\u2019s actions, this Sunday
    could light the touch paper to an explosive situation, reaching far beyond the
    borders of the Empire and Republic."
