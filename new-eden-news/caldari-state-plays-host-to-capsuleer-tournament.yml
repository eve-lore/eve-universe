- body: "Earlier today, the Caldari Gaming Commission announced their plans to host
    the largest capsuleer fighting tournament since the Amarr Championships. Announcing
    the names of the sixty-four alliances eligible to compete, a state official said
    \"We are expecting to see some of the worlds most skilled fighters at this event,
    the capsuleer alliances have tremendous strength and our main interest lies in
    seeing who will come out on top.\"  \n  \nWith surprisingly little time for preparation,
    each alliance must select three of their most competent fighters to compete on
    their behalf. Six pilots will then meet in an arena set up at a secret location.
    The winning team moves on to the next round, while the losers are eliminated.
    \ \n  \nSome political analysts believe that this is the first step of war preparation
    for the Caldari, and that they are simply \"testing them\". \"In the past few
    years, capsuleer alliances have been growing at a rate faster than we could have
    ever imagined, especially in the outer regions. One day they might actually start
    posing as threats to the empires.\"   \n  \nWhatever the case may be, the whole
    world will be watching as this tournament unveils."
