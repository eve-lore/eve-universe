- body: 'BOURYNES 1003 - An emergency conference of scientists arranged by University
    of Caille has concluded that a "solar radiological pulse" originating from the
    blue sun of the Seyllin system is to blame for the ongoing catastrophe on its
    innermost planet. They ruled out the possibility of a military attack - including
    a potential nuclear strike - based on the size and scale of the devastation, stating
    that "no arsenal in the possession of any nation-state in the cluster is capable
    of delivering such widespread and deep devastation in such a short period of time."


    More ominously, the conference reported that the possibility of a supernova still
    cannot be ruled out, despite the fact that the local Seyllin sun (a powerful O-class
    star) was not expected to do so for at least another million years. The symptoms
    of Seyllin I appear consistent with a post-main sequence event, as the planet
    has been doused in massive bursts of ultraviolet energy and high-energy particles
    such as x- and gamma rays. Those deep beneath the surface or on the night-side
    of the planet might be spared the brunt of any thermal effect, but radiological
    damage would be felt across the entire world.


    The scientists warned that for any installation or outpost on the surface of the
    side directly facing a radiological pulse of that magnitude, the probability of
    survival is zero.'
