    - The Amarr Navy has begun preparations to hand over the new Imperial Flagship
    to Empress Jamyl Sarum today, with a number of vessels sighted moving between
    the Throne Worlds and Amarr Navy Headquarters in preparation for her arrival.\n\nTES
    Auctoritas, the second Abaddon Imperial Issue constructed, is expected to be formally
    handed over to the Emperor Family at approximately 18:00 this evening in Safizon
    and commissioned as the Amarr Empire's new ceremonial flagship. It is then expected
    that Auctoritas will fly to Amarr under escort from both the Imperial Guard and
    Amarr Navy, where she will join a full military parade formation of the Throne
    Worlds Defense Fleet, which will formally welcome her to the First Fleet.\n\nMilitary
    enthusiasts from across the cluster have already begun to flock to Safizon in
    preparation for the unveiling of the new vessel. It is believed that like previous
    \"Imperial\" class vessels, she will be decoratively plated in a cosmetic layer
    of pure gold that covers what has been described as the most advanced Imperial
    armor technology ever conceived. \n\nA number of vessels dressed in the colors
    of Sarum, Kor-Azor and Ardishapur have already been sighted in the last 48 hours
    making their way toward Amarr, where it is expected that TES Auctoritas will be
    greeted by representatives from the five houses on parade."
