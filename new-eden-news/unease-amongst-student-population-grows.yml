- body: "ESSENCE. Throughout the universities of New Eden, a number of student protests
    have turned violent leading to arrests as tensions rise between students and the
    administrative bodies regarding a recent resurgence in the desire to leave the
    control of the four empires, and see the fostering of new inter-empire relationships.
    \n\nIn many universities, capsuleer and planet bound students are feeling pressured
    by the overbearing presence of the university administration boards allowing the
    politics of New Eden to restrict academic development between all the empires.
    During a meeting concerning these issues in the Aporulie system, one Gallente
    student explained that instead of the divisions that currently divide the empires
    they \"intend to work as a group to conduct groundbreaking research and other
    studies that cannot currently exist in this politically charged atmosphere.\"
    \n\nThe concern of the university ruling bodies is twofold, the empires in general
    are usually quite unwilling to share information across the ideological divisions
    that currently exist in New Eden, and this may also be motivated by military concerns
    despite the uneasy peace between them. Secondly, co-operation with universities
    in other empires may result in budget cuts or sanctions against them. Both factors
    are driving university administrators to oppose co-operation at this time. \n\nAs
    tensions rise between students and university officials, a multitude of students
    from various universities have begun to actively protest against the university
    administrators with demands that their voices be heard. In various public speeches,
    students from the University of Caille have suggested the formation of a focused
    study group in a neutral territory that is open to students from all across New
    Eden. Shortly after this announcement the protest began to turn violent, and Gallente
    security forces moved in to calm the situation, with a number of students arrested.
    \n\nIn the wake of this protest, numerous others are planned at universities across
    New Eden."
