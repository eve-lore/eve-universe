    moratorium has been placed on the four empires\u2019 upcoming initiative to buy
    back Misu Baniya\u2019s body parts on the market.   \n  \nThe moratorium, SCC
    officials say, is due to the \u201Cmassive effect these transactions will have
    on the galactic economy. We are talking about a multi-billion ISK influx here,
    and these prices will need to be regulated and monitored carefully if we are not
    to fall head-first into an inflation the likes of which hasn\u2019t been seen
    in hundreds of years. These kinds of large-scale market ventures need to be handled
    with the utmost care.\u201D   \n  \nThe SCC has set next Friday as a tentative
    date for the moratorium\u2019s lifting, at which point new details regarding the
    market initiative will be brought to light."
