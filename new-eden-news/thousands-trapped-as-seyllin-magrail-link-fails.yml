- body: "SEYLLIN - In yet another disastrous turn of events, the magrail link between
    the cities of Loadcore and Southern Cross on Seyllin I has failed, trapping thousands
    of refugees underground.   \n  \nPlanetary evacuation is currently being conducted
    through the spaceports in Southern Cross and Valimor, as the other two major cities,
    Loadcore and Metal City, are located on the day side of the planet and are inaccessible
    by dropship. Thousands of refugees in Loadcore and Southern Cross had rushed to
    the magrail stations, after President Foiritan had confirmed that the cities on
    the day side of Seyllin will not be evacuated.   \n  \nHowever, shortly thereafter
    a malfunction was reported on the major magrail link between Loadcore and Southern
    Cross, trapping a number of overcrowded trains underground.   \n  \n\"The system
    just wasn't designed to handle the load of such magnitude,\" said Jouno Wallid,
    senior engineer at Duvolle Laboratories. \"Depending on the severity, it could
    take hours to get the magrail system up and running again.\"  \n  \nAlthough the
    failed link is accessible via emergency tunnels, the malfunction is likely to
    severely hamper the already strained evacuation efforts."
