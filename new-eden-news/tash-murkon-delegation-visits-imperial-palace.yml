- body: 'Amarr Prime - The Imperial Palace hosted a meeting today between high-level
    officials from both the Imperial Chancellery and the Tash-Murkon family, at which
    a member of Catiz Tash-Murkon''s immediate family was rumored to be present. The
    meeting was the first in a series currently scheduled to continue through the
    end of the week.


    According to household officials, the meeting was requested with less than 48
    hours notice, which, according to protocol expert Odreluk Olnabim, would normally
    be a significant faux pas. "The fact the request was granted indicates that either
    the Tash-Murkon have accumulated considerably more clout since the Empress''s
    ascension, or that the Imperial Chancellor shares a feeling of urgency on the
    meeting''s topic, whatever it is," she explained.


    According to the Tash-Murkon Family, the meetings were called to discuss "a matter
    of significant financial interest to the Empire and its subjects." Details were
    scant, however, with the Tash-Murkon spokesman saying that "it would be improper
    for us to talk about these matters with the press before we discuss them with
    the Imperial court." The Imperial Chancellor''s office has refused comment entirely.'
