    - Spacelane Patrol, the security arm of the CBD Corporation, has published the
    results of its  investigation into the Kaunokka incident, an explosion which took
    the lives of 25 workers last month. Although the report claims to have uncovered
    a number of irregularities related to DCMI safety regulations, worker conduct
    and equipment maintenance, the outcome is inconclusive at best.\n\n\"Investigation
    of the safety procedures at the Kaunokka III-1 strip mine belonging to Deep Core
    Mining Inc. has revealed numerous breaches of established protocol; however, there
    also were at least ten recorded cases of worker misconduct, any of which could
    have led to the incident,\" the report says.\n\n\"Additionally, most equipment
    was commissioned a long time ago and is in remarkably poor condition. The incident
    could have happened due to any combination of these factors, not excluding the
    possibility of industrial sabotage. Sadly, we have to point out the facility management's
    unwillingness to cooperate, which may also have had an impact on the proceedings.\"\n\n\"It
    is a pitiful excuse for an investigation,\" said Reita Wotimi, a representative
    of the DCMI miners in Kaunokka. \"What it basically says is that our coworkers
    could have died for any reason, while clearly someone out there is responsible
    for this horrible incident.\"\n\nKauri Mulvolen, an analyst for Caldari Funds
    Unlimited, stated he thinks the investigation did more harm than good. \"The vague
    and, frankly speaking, meaningless report underlines some deep management problems
    at DCMI.  While some may argue that the incident in question was blown way out
    of proportion, the corporation could - and should - have handled it itself. Involvement
    of Spacelane Patrol brought it into national spotlight, and now they basically
    admit they don't know what happened. It is not a good sign for any investor.\""
