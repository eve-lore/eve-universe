- body: "Souro Foiritan, President of the Gallente Federation, last Thursday delivered
    a sixty-five minute address to his nation.   \n  \nCalling for heightened awareness
    of current issues, the President extolled the virtues of free speech and individual
    liberty while denouncing acts of terror by those who seek to destroy those very
    virtues.   \n  \n\u201COur hard-fought freedoms can not, and will not, be stamped
    out by the iron boot of tyranny. Whatever the cost, this we must fight for,\u201D
    said the President.   \n  \nHe then went on to list the possible social and economic
    ramifications of terrorist activity, citing prior evidence of escalating crime
    rates and inflation in some of the societies hardest hit by terrorism through
    history, and providing what seemed to most fairly convincing evidence that acts
    of terror, in the long run, help no one.   \n  \nThe President allowed himself
    to get quite in-depth and technical during the first part of his address. One
    analyst was overheard remarking that Foiritan would be lucky if one-fourth of
    his nation understood what he was talking about, while others have cited the atypical
    tone as evidence of the President\u2019s respect for his people\u2019s intelligence.
    \  \n  \nAfter a short period of silence to commemorate the Elarel dead at the
    30-minute mark, Foiritan spoke briefly of the UDI, the faction claiming responsibility
    for the massacre. Most notable was the President\u2019s admission that a UDI operative
    had indeed been captured yesterday, and that his capture had led investigators
    to further discoveries along the road to rooting out the people behind the UDI.
    \u201CYou know who you are,\u201D said the President, \u201Cand you know we\u2019re
    coming for you.\u201D   \n  \nAnalysts find themselves befuddled over the President\u2019s
    admission of the operative\u2019s capture in the middle of his speech, as well
    as the normally populist ruler\u2019s highly uncharacteristic absence at the post-address
    press conference.   \n  \nOne reporter, a Scope representative, was reported as
    asking whether the President\u2019s spirits had been affected by the last fortnight\u2019s
    turn of events.   \n  \nReplied Thuire Dercoucon, Federal Press Secretary: \u201CThe
    President is fine. He just needs to concentrate on the tasks at hand. The support
    of the Gallente people is well appreciated in this trying time.\u201D"
