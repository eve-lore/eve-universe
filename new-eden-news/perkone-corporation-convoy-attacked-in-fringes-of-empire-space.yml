- body: "The Perkone corporation, whose sales have been dwindling of late, found themselves
    under a sustained attack from border region pilots earlier tonight.   \n  \nThe
    convoy, consisting of 4 Perkone industrial blockade breakers, travelled 15 jumps
    from secure space to the backwater regions of Caldari space, to a system called
    Paala. When they got there, their cargo, said to be mining equipment was unloaded
    and they set a course back to Akora.   \n  \nIt was then that their problems started.
    6 battleships from the Infinitus Odium corporation opened fire on the entire convoy,
    decimating several of the escorting ships almost instantaneously.   \n  \nAll
    of the convoy ships managed to pass through the blockade, but it was a race to
    get the final 5 jumps to Akora in one piece. Kyogen Steiner, a Raven pilot, had
    the route well planned out and managed to arrive at all of the gates ahead of
    the convoy.   \n  \nAs fast as he was though all of the convoy ships made it through.
    The only last worry was an ambush of smaller Infinitus Odium on the jump into
    Akora.   \n  \nPerkone Corporation released a statement thanking the brave pilots
    who escorted the convoy to safety, saying that they would not soon forget their
    courageous actions. They also said that they would look to hiring more security
    for future missions to that sector of space."
