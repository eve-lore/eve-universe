- body: "Yonis Ardishapur, one of the five Amarr heirs, has publicly voiced his concern
    over the 'incident' involving his fellow heir Articio Kor-Azor in a cathedral
    recently. The news that many irreplaceable religious artifacts were lost and untold
    damage done to the sacred ground has enraged those strong of faith and Ardishapur
    especially bemoans the loss of the holy artifacts, of which he is an avid collector.
    \  \n  \nArdishapur has demanded a full report of the 'incident' to be given to
    the Theology Council as soon as possible and that the Emperor, as the chief religious
    figure in the empire, reprimand Articio Kor-Azor for his irresponsible and sacrilegious
    behavior. The Imperial Chamberlain has already answered Ardishapur's request on
    behalf on the Emperor and stated that Doriam did not share Ardishapur's concern
    on the matter and would not take any action against Articio Kor-Azor."
