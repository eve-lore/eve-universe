- body: 'Onnamon - In yet another twist in the recent events, multiple reports are
    coming in of new stargates appearing in systems on the fringes of Caldari and
    Gallente space. It would appear that the volume of space known as Black Rise -
    previously thought to be completely impenetrable - has been secretly colonized
    by Caldari forces.


    Initial reports from capsuleers indicate that the new region contains a wealth
    of virgin systems, full of resources unexploited thus far by the four empires.
    Additionally, early cartography has revealed that the region opens an additional
    border between Caldari and Gallente sovereign space, something officials on both
    sides are scrambling to prepare for as they readjust strategies. Even as they
    do so, pod pilots both loyalist and independent are rushing into the area to stake
    a claim of their own.


    It remains unclear exactly how the phenonema shrouding this area were penetrated,
    or indeed how the Caldari State has managed to colonize the area in complete secrecy.
    State officials have so far remained tight-lipped on any details, providing no
    explanations. After such startling events in recent times however, and with officials
    from all three Empires as well as CONCORD pushing for answers on the matter, it
    is something they will likely have to address in the nearby future.'
