    Phased Field Fractures Blamed on Drifter Wormhole Occupiers\n\nAn investigation
    has linked the spacetime \u201CFractures\u201D appearing across New Eden to Hyperspace
    Network testing taking place in Drifter Wormhole systems. According to a joint
    team of scientists from CONCORD and the Society of Conscious Thought, the energy
    signatures surrounding the Fractures match those recorded around the unidentified
    Drifter Nexus structures during the Drifter Crisis. Each of these structures has
    a unique energy signature; the Fractures contain all five signatures, implicating
    all five occupiers. These structures and the Hyperspace Network they connect to
    have been the subject of extensive testing by the five Drifter Wormhole occupying
    groups.\n\nAccording to the investigation team, these occupiers have been carrying
    out \u201Creckless\u201D experiments resulting in the proliferation of Fractures.
    The five occupying forces are: The Amarr Empire, the Caldari State, EDENCOM, the
    Minmatar Republic, and the Triglavian Collective. All five are known to have been
    conducting Hyperspace Network research. This network was used extensively by the
    Drifters throughout last year\u2019s Drifter Crisis, and the structures were focal
    points of Drifter activity during the final days of that conflict. \n\nAn emergency
    meeting of CONCORD\u2019s Inner Circle was called to discuss the implications
    of the investigation. Despite the evidence presented by the investigating team,
    Amarr, Caldari, and Minmatar representatives have all denied any responsibility
    for the creation of the Fractures. CONCORD has also announced plans for a closed-door
    hearing to review the actions of EDENCOM. Provost Marshal Kasiha Valkanir, head
    of Aegis and the EDENCOM project, has also denied any wrongdoing. She claims that
    \u201Cthe integrity and safety of New Eden are at the core of our organization's
    remit. We would never knowingly take actions that put either of those things at
    risk.\u201D \n\nThe Triglavians, however, have not joined the other occupiers
    in denying responsibility. Despite being outside of CONCORD\u2019s control, they
    have chosen to respond with the following statement:\n\n*All Ancient Enemy Azdaja
    must face extirpation. All tools of the Ancient Enemy Azdaja must face extirpation.
    Only then can the ancient Domains be brought within the Flow of Vyraj. Only then
    is advanced-time stability within the Domains of Bujan istina. Fitness brings
    stability, proving reveals fitness, risk guarantees proving.*\n\n![Phased Asteroid](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/5aGdeqldnRwfItxAtLdgFO/b99f1d6686e0022e08b4a6c0c8bbc258/Phased_Asteroid.png)\n\n###
    ORE Moves Swiftly to Unlock Phased Field Profits\n\nORE has been quick to release
    a suite of new technologies that unlock the riches held inside the Phased Fields
    that surround these Fractures. While many have already begun to take advantage
    of the new opportunities Phased Fields offer, others question how ORE was able
    to develop the new tech so soon after the first Fracture was sighted.\n\nHigh
    Priestess Harna Durado of the Sisters of EVE is one such person. She told the
    Scope, \u201CHow ORE\u2019s Phase Anchors could be developed without prior observation
    of Phased Asteroids, or at least similar phenomena, has perplexed our engineering
    and research teams.\u201D Phased Asteroids, which appear within our reality as
    a Fracture moves through a Phased Field, contain unique erratic ores that can
    be processed into a variety of minerals. In order to efficiently mine these asteroids,
    a miner must utilize one of ORE\u2019s patented Phase Anchors, which brings the
    asteroid into phase with local space.\n\nThe Upwell Consortium, of which ORE is
    a member, has been in a public research partnership with EDENCOM, assisting in
    their Drifter Wormhole experimentation. If there was advanced evidence of these
    Phased Asteroids before the first Fracture was spotted in New Eden, it is possible
    that ORE had access to this information. Both the Consortium board and EDENCOM
    have denied these accusations as unfounded rumors. The Consortium released an
    official statement refuting these rumors, ending with \u201Cour business is founded
    on a bond of reliability and trust with the people of New Eden, and we would never
    betray that trust.\u201D\n\n### News in Brief\n\n- Community leaders in Jita join
