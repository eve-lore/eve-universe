- body: "The Federation Government released its annual budget report last Wednesday
    afternoon, in a statement issued at the Senate\u2019s final yearly sitting. Addressing
    a wide range of recent economic improvements, the report showed a financially
    healthy Federation geared towards a solid period of growth and consolidation.
    \n\nAn excerpt of the release delivered by Presidential Spokesperson Yuri Meureux
    follows:\n\n_\u201CThe Federation has never been stronger, and it is clear to
    see that this is due to a sound foreign policy, backed by sensible internal spending
    and fiscal management. The last reporting period saw a 12% rise in the average
    standard of living, a decrease in infant mortality rates to less than twenty in
    one thousand, and a rise across the board in consumer spending; a clear indication
    of a booming economy.\n\nGovernment revenue is steadily rising without a tax increase.
    The increase in volume of trade throughout the Federation has allowed the bolstering
    of annual budgets in key departments; notably the Federation Navy and Federation
    Customs.\n\nAdditionally, this increase in funding will allow the Federation Customs
    the ability to create a new department, dedicated to preventing the scourge of
    illegal narcotics trafficking. This team will ensure the quality of life for all
    citizens continues to improve by keeping our streets clean.\u201D_\n\nCoinciding
    with the Federation report were those of three independent financial assessment
    firms, contracted as third party advisors by each of the other empires. All three
    reports agreed with the figures posted by the Federal Government. In a concerned
    address to the Chief Executive Panel following the announcement, the Caldari Business
    Tribunal also issued a similar review. The trend towards increased economic might
    in the Federation has been a continual source of anxiety in the Caldari State
    as it slides towards a recession of its own. \n\nAn excerpt follows of an interview
    between Henri Cassel, Chief Economic Advisor at the Garoun Investment Bank and
    Gabriel Fontaine of the Interstellar Correspondents:\n\n**Gabriel Fontaine:**
    Is there any truth to the claims of the Federal Government regarding the strength
    of the Federation\u2019s economy?\n\n**Henri Cassel:** As with any government
    statement, you are likely to have a bit of embellishment, but the simple fact
    is that the Federation\u2019s economy is doing rather well at this moment, that
    much is beyond doubt. I am always wary however, of politicians trying to take
    credit for fluctuations that are usually part of a greater economic cycle.\n\n**GF:**
    Do you see these positive trends continuing? With average incomes on the rise,
    and the early indications of recession in the Caldari State, there are likely
    to be some investors looking to move their ISK. What would you say to them?\n\n**HC:**
    I would say that moving investments, especially short-term ones, over to Federation
    corporations is likely a smart move. The Caldari economy is resilient, and will
    recover eventually, but for now I would expect to see a great increase in investment
    inside Gallente space.\n\nThe State economy has been performing poorly in comparison
    to the recent Federation figures, with many analysts agreeing that recent large-scale
    economic events have returned lacklustre revenue, causing further economic fallouts
    in their wake. Sindri Hinrik, head of the Economics department at Science and
    Trade Institute agreed partially with the Federation\u2019s report, stating: \u201CWith
    the recent Mind Clash tournaments pulling in below expected revenue there was
    an influx of foreign investors falling back to the long-term reliability of the
    Federation\u2019s entertainment industry. We\u2019ve been losing foreign investment
    and domestic capital in this fashion for a long period of time now, and the gears
    have started to slow down in many areas as a result.\u201D\n\nMr Hinrik did not
    agree however, with the assessment that corporations outside the State represented
    a better investment. \u201CKey industries in the State have always been solid
    enough performers to provide sustainable growth. The State is robust and flexible
    and will still remain competitive in many fields, readjusting during this period
    of downturn to consolidate in those areas more fully.\u201D\n\nDespite the wary
    sentiments of outsiders, most in the Federation have embraced the good news and
    are pleased with the Government\u2019s recent fiscal management. An unusually
    placated Senate praised the reports and promised to push towards further growth
    through bipartisan co-operation. The new departmental openings have particularly
    helped the Presidential office, which has slowly earned more support throughout
    the previously disgruntled security community, a sector that has struggled in
    recent years with funding and governmental assistance. The renewed growth of the
    Federation\u2019s military industry has also provided millions of new jobs, helping
    reduce the level of unemployment even further, ensuring additional popularity
    for the administration in areas previously lacking their support. \n\nThe President
    has not issued any personal statements at this point in time, preferring to delegate
    the announcement to one of his spokesman. Many have commended the singular Senate
    announcement as a sign that President Foiritan intends to continue towards improving
    the Federation without self-congratulatory fanfare. \u201CIt\u2019s good news
    for him and the government,\u201D stated Mr. Cassel. \u201CHe looks at the moment,
    however, like a man wanting to get on with the job.\u201D"
