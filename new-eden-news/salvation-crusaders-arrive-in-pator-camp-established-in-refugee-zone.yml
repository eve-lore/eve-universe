- body: 'Pator - The ''Salvation Crusade'' movement of emancipated slaves preaching
    the Amarrian faith in Minmatar space reached Pator yesterday, and promptly set
    up a camp in the largest refugee holding zone on Matar. Abel Jarek, the charismatic
    preacher and former slave who leads the Salvation Crusaders, stated that the first
    task would be to build an Amarrian chapel so that "believers may worship in the
    house of God and take comfort in His shelter."


    The Salvation Crusade has caused considerable controversy in the Republic since
    news of Abel Jarek''s intentions reached citizens here. Many Minmatar are outraged
    that Jarek and his followers have been allowed to set up their camp on Matar and
    news that an Amarrian chapel is to be built is thought likely to inflame passions
    even more. Sources in the Republic government have officially confined themselves
    to confirming that since Jarek and his followers have claimed Republic citizenship
    as returning former slaves, there is no legal means to bar them from settling
    on Matar. One anonymous source did comment that "calling this a ''crusade'' is
    only asking for trouble, given our history and the fact that we are at war with
    actual crusaders [the 24th Imperial Crusade] in Heimatar even now."


    While the Amarr authorities have made no official comment on Jarek taking up Republic
    citizenship, it is believed that any Salvation Crusader who returns to the Empire
    will incur no penalty under the circumstances. Many Minmatar see this as evidence
    that Jarek is nothing more than an agent provocateur and his crusade a means of
    destabilising the situation among refugees on Pator.'
