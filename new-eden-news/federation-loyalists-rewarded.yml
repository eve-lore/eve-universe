- body: "**LUMINAIRE:** It was a night of celebration in Luminaire as many independent
    capsuleers descended on the Federation Customs Headquarters for a party. \n\nThe
    highest award that the Federation can issue to capsuleers, The Federal Star Of
    Justice, was presented to three pilots. It is the first time that three have been
    issued at the same time, and indeed the first time that the medal has been issued
    in over ten years. The inscription on the Star reads; _\u201CThe Federal Star
    of Justice is a golden medallion, awarded by the Gallente Federation to individuals
    who have displayed exceptional bravery, self-sacrifice and wisdom in promoting
    the causes of liberty and democracy across the universe.\u201D_\n\nPytria Le'Danness
    made a short speech when she received hers. _\u201CThe capture of the Cobra squad's
    carrier was an important and unique event, and I am proud I was able to help a
    little in achieving it. In accepting this medal, I wish to thank EVERYONE who
    helped for his participation, no matter how small the help was\u201D.\n\n\u201CI
    just want to say thank you, to Fed Customs and FIO for allowing capsuleer citizens
    to help them on their efforts,\u201D_ Bruno Bonner spoke out as he accepted his
    medal _\u201DA big thank you for all our partners in the actions that lead to
    this day. May the federation thrive on the wings of those who choose to defend
    it!\u201D_\n\nThe final Star was awarded to a Caldari for the first time ever,
    evidence of the Federation being an all-inclusive society. Yarod Cool, had this
    to say _\u201CI'm just glad I could help out, nearly from the beginning. When
    I heard that drugs were found, I told the Inspector. All you pilots, when you
    see a way to help the Federation, go out and take it.\u201D_\n\nInspector Xavier,
    clearly in an emotional mood, then announced his retirement. He mentioned that
    he was _\u201Ctired after spending twenty-five years in the anti-drugs business\u201D._
    He certainly wasn\u2019t too tired to enjoy the party, which went on until the
    early hours, bolstered by a large gift of spirits from Yarod Cool. Xavier is now
    looking forward to spending some time with his family and going fishing at his
    holiday home on Oursulaert VI's first moon."
