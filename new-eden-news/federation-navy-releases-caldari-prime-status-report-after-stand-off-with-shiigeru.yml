- body: "LUMINAIRE - Caldari and Gallente forces came close to a full combat situation
    in orbit of Caldari Prime approximately an hour ago, as a Federation Navy patrol
    was sighted apparently making reconnaissance scans of the besieged planet's surface.\n\nCaldari
    Navy forces were quick to react, with Admiral Visera Yanala issuing demands for
    Federation Navy vessels to cease all ongoing operations and vacate orbit of Caldari
    Prime. During her broadcast over the local Luminaire frequency, she repeatedly
    claimed that Federation Navy forces were \"in violation of Caldari airspace\"
    and issued notification that failure to comply with her requests would result
    in defensive action from the Caldari fleet. \n\nIn response, the Federation Navy
    patrol made attempts to assuage the concerns of the Caldari fleet, with Admiral
    Auvier Bauvon indicating that the Gallente vessels were simply a reconnaissance
    patrol, tasked with reviewing the status of Federal citizens on Caldari Prime.
    After 30 minutes, when they had apparently completed their scans at a safe distance,
    the Federation Navy vessels departed without further incident.\n\nAround fifteen
    minutes ago the Federation Navy made an unprecedented press release from its headquarters
    in the neighboring system of Algogille, revealing the full details of scans from
    its reconnaissance patrol. Admiral Auvier Bauvon was frank in stating that \"the
    situation on Caldari Prime is extremely dire.\"\n\nHe continued the briefing by
    indicating that the Federation Navy \"now has confirmed reports of continued unrest
    in the cities of Arcurio, Pakuri and Tovil, with thermal scans showing fires burning
    freely in a number of locations below the cloud cover.\" Admiral Bauvon then presented
    a detailed breakdown of events over the previous five days in the lead-up to Admiral
    Yanala's return to service.\n\nIn response to the Federation Navy's release of
    information, the Caldari Providence Directorate has declared a no-fly zone in
    low-orbit airspace around Caldari Prime. The Caldari Navy has been authorized
    to engage and destroy any vessel that breaches the order."
