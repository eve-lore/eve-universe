- body: "Kor-Azor Prime - Sources close to the Kador family have revealed that, as
    his first official act since his recent encounter with one of the Speakers of
    Truths, Articio Kor-Azor is to nominate an interim Court Chamberlain in the next
    few days. His choice will reportedly have the blessing of the other Heirs and
    the Theology Council. \n\nAs general coordinator of the Imperial Succession the
    Chamberlain's role is a pivotal one, and with former Chamberlain Karsoth no longer
    present the selection of a replacement is a key step in the coronation of a new
    Emperor. Our Kador contact intimated that the debate over the correct protocol
    for appointing a Chamberlain in the absence of an Emperor was a protracted and
    acrimonious one. The arguments leaning heavily on the traditional appointment
    of the Chamberlain by the Emperor, and Articio's status as heir of the last Imperial
    family, finally convinced those advocating devolving the responsibility to the
    Theology Council to acquiesce. \n\nIt has been suggested that this appointment,
    in enabling the Succession to proceed, will allow the reign of Doriam II to finally
    come to a close. The new Emperor traditionally apppoints their own Chamberlain
    shortly after the coronation, at which point the last vestiges of Doriam's reign
    will be laid to rest."
