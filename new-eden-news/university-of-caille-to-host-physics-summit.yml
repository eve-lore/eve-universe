    campus as the annual Galactic Physics Summit nears. The summit, an annual three-day
    gathering of the top physicists in the cluster, is being hosted by the University
    and has traditionally been a rather dry and basic meeting, where top physicists
    standardize nomenclature for new discoveries, compare notes on low-level experimentation,
    and hold unofficial think-tanks to present ideas and theories with their peers.


    However, in the past few years it has become famous, among physicists at least,
    as a place for research scientists to meet venture capitalists who can fund their
    experiments. Notably, last year''s gathering (hosted by the School of Applied
    Knowledge Todaki Campus), drew several prominent investors in the ship and weapons
    manufacturing sector. Shortly after the Summit, many of the top researchers and
    Kaalakiota Corporation jointly announced the founding of Gravitech Corporation.


    Though Gravitech Corporation has not yet released any major findings, the major
    buzz around this year''s Summit is that Gravitech will announce the findings their
    year of research has uncovered. The exact nature of these findings has remained
    a heavily guarded secret however.


    Because many expect the Gravitech announcement to be heavily attended by navy
    officials, dignitaries, and capsuleers from all four Empires and beyond, the University
    has had to beef up security at the Summit. "Most of us aren''t used to being watched
    by armed guards," said Professor Liue Gunban, the top astrophysics lecturer for
    the Royal Amarr Institute.'
