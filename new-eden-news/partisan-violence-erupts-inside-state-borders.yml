- body: "Reports are coming in of widespread anti-Gallente violence in major cities
    across the State, as vigilante groups raid recently-closed businesses and residences
    that once housed Federation expatriates. Another eyewitness account has alleged
    that almost 1,000 State citizens of Gallentean origin on Urlen II also met a violent
    end at the hands of angry mobs. Conflicting reports state that once news of the
    Federation invasion broke, the Gallentean-born citizens armed themselves and \"started
    shooting whoever they saw.\" \n\nCaldari authorities are believed to be addressing
    both issues with force. Local officials have claimed that corporate security forces
    have been deployed. With a complete media access restriction in effect however,
    very little can be confirmed."
