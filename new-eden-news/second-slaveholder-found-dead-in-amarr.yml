- body: "A man was found murdered today under similar circumstances to last Friday\u2019s
    brutal slaying of local slaveholder Rezini Lifu.   \n  \nIdentified as Bamadak
    Pareh, he was found early this morning in his hanger by cleaning staff. Security
    systems were inexplicably offline throughout that deck during the time the murder
    was thought to have occurred. Local authorities have stated that as yet no witnesses
    have come forward with information.   \n  \nPareh was said to be a friend of Rezini
    Lifu and was involved extensively in the underground Gladiator ring as an arms
    dealer. As was the case in Lifu's murder, Pareh's entire stock of slaves and Gladiators
    has been reported missing, along with a number of ammunition and weapons crates
    and several valuable spacecraft.   \n  \nLocal authorities have said that they
    suspect the two incidents to be related.   \n  \nThough his family was unavailable
    for comment, a source close to the wife and two sons of Bamadak Pareh has stated
    that his family has expressed the strong desire to see those involved in his murder
    brought to justice and their property safely returned."
