    CBT launched a formal investigation into the \u201CElectronics Parts\u201D research
    effort.   \n  \nAfter requesting and receiving access to Sukuuvestaa facilities
    in Josameto, investigators Lt. Sance and Sgt. Pops conducted an armed raid at
    the lab where researchers Mr. Vance and Mr. Vics were supposedly conducting their
    \u201Cfirst prototype of our 'Brain Wave Control Technology', aimed at ridding
    the EVE cluster of criminals\u201D, according to Mr. Vance\u2019s previous statements
    in public Caldari FTL comm channels.   \n  \n\u201CThe room had been recently
    evacuated,\u201D said Lt. Sance. \u201CWe found some perfectly legal brain scanning
    equipment and a few scraps of paper; other than that, we were unable to locate
    any leads about the nature of the research efforts, let alone proof about it being
    harmful or otherwise illegal.\u201D   \n  \n\u201CWe have interviewed many pod-pilots
    present on the comm channels at the time and no one could provide us with conclusive
    evidence that either Mr. Vance or Mr. Vics were engaged in illegal activities
    or requesting illegal products. Buying electronic parts is no crime in the State.\"
    \  \n  \nAccording to Sgt. Sance, although the investigators are aware that both
    scientists have been reported requiring help from pod-pilots to continue with
    their research at the TransStellar Shipping storage station in Rens, no effort
    will be done to contact them in Minmatar space.   \n  \n\u201CWhile the public
    statements made by the researchers were enough to call for an investigation inside
    Caldari space, without further proof of Mr. Vance and/or Mr. Vics being actively
    engaged in illegal activities there is nothing we can officially do now that they
    are out of our jurisdiction. Caldari citizens concerned in this matter should
    get in contact with Republic authorities.\u201D"
