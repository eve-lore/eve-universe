    the Khumaak, an ornamental weapon traditionally carried in ceremonial circumstances
    by high-ranking fleet and military officers. The Tribal Council is still no closer
    to reaching a resolution, both Sebiestor and Krusual tribe leaders having exchanged
    harsh words throughout the week in a series of hard-fought debates.  \n  \nMeanwhile
    the Republic\u2019s cities are alive with protests and demonstrations, and violence
    is reported to have broken out at various locations. Yesterday the Republic Security
    Services defused an explosive charge thad had been hidden in the Sebiestor Tribe\u2019s
    regional headquarters in Houdea, a charge which, if detonated, would have destroyed
    the entire building and surrounding environs. Various Minmatar extremist factions
    are now under heavy investigation, and some regions have seen frequent skirmishes
    between law enforcement officials and extremist guerillas.   \n  \nA massive rally
    will reportedly be held at an undisclosed location at 1700 EVE Standard Time today,
    where Minmatar pilots of all stripes will gather in protest of the Sebiestor tribe\u2019s
    motion. One of the rally\u2019s organizers earlier this week issued a release
    stating that the pilots present would \u201Cdemand answers to the current policies
    and trends coming from the Sebiestor Tribe Council.\u201D Going on to address
    Sebiestor tribal head Karin Midular, he then added \u201CIlluminate us, your people,
    on your motives, or reap the darkness that you sow.\u201D"
