    presidential palace in Caille describe president Foiritan as being unusually irritable
    and edgy when outside the public spotlight. It\u2019s said that Foiritan\u2019s
    foul temper has brought some of his aides to tears, while the staff of the palace
    are keeping their head low to escape being the brunt of one of his irrational
    tantrums. If true, this strongly indicates that Foiritan is feeling the pressure
    as wave after wave of unofficial polls predict that his referendum, which he has
    invested so much of his political capital on, will be rejected by the people.
    This would certainly ruin the illustrious career of one of the most charismatic
    presidents the Federation has ever seen, forcing him to live out the remaining
    two years of his term dancing to the beat set by the Senate.   \n  \nHowever,

    own people to commit a similar act of aggression completely unravels their case.
    The little the leaders of the Federation have been willing to say on the matter
    is to deny any kind of links whatsoever to those responsible for the incident
    last Thursday during the race."
