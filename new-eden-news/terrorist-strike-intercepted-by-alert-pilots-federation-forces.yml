    the Sharuveil system interrupted by a large strike force of mercenary vessels
    believed to have been operating under the influence of the UDI organization.   \nThe
    resort, located off the shoulder of Sharuveil VII, sustained significant damage
    in the attack, but a swift and decisive counterattack by the pilots present at
    the opening sufficed to dismantle the first wave of mercenaries. UDI reinforcements
    continued to flood in, however, and before long the area was a battle zone.   \n
    \ \nOnly a few minutes into the struggle, six capsule-fitted FIO task force battleships
    arrived on the scene, proceeding to engage UDI forces with extreme prejudice.
    According to witnesses, their arrival dramatically shifted the tide of battle,
    resulting, in the space of only a few minutes, in the complete decimation of assembled
    UDI forces.   \n  \n\u201CAlthough considerable damage was done to our new station,
    we were able to continue the opening by sealing off those damaged parts of the
    resort,\u201D says Devalon Haratel, CEO and founder of Gallente Frontier Tour
    Lines. \u201CI would like to give my special thanks to the pilots that assisted
    in defending our new resort, especially those who lost their ships in their valiant
    effort.\u201D   \n  \n\u201CI would of course also give my full appreciation to
    President Foiritan. Without the quick thinking of his men, lives may have been
    lost. To my mind, the FIO proved today that while we may not see a whole lot of
    what they do, they\u2019re definitely working in the interest of the Federation
    and its members.\u201D   \n  \nAccording to an unconfirmed source, FIO agents
    had a few hours previous to the attack managed to intercept and decode private
    transmissions between high-ranking UDI personnel, thus learning of the imminent
    strike. Federation news broadcasts are already hailing the incident as a victory
    for the Gallente, but despite positive public opinion government and agency officials
    have remained tight-lipped, commenting only in the barest terms. Federal Press
    Secretary Thuire Dercoucon, on behalf of the President, had this to say:   \n
    \ \n\u201CThe attack, and the information obtained in its wake, has given us new
    leads to pursue in bringing the perpetrators of crimes like these to justice.\u201D
    \  \n  \nRefusing to field any further inquiries, the secretary shortly afterward
    took his leave of the press conference.   \n  \nMany believe the attack was an
    attempt on the part of the UDI to, as senior analyst Brill Stone puts it, \u201Cunderscore
    and analogize Elarel,\u201D the massacre of two months ago \u2013 a fleet strike
    which killed thousands of people, among them hundreds of known and loved Gallente
    holoreel stars.   \n  \nAdded Stone, \u201CThey\u2019re letting us know that they\u2019re
    still out there, that they know what they\u2019re doing, and that we should be
    afraid. We can only hope we\u2019ve let them know something in return.\u201D"
