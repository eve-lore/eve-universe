- body: 'Pator - Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor has issued a call for the Seven Tribes of
    Matar to meet "in grand assembly in not less than three months time." In his short
    address to the Republic Parliament''s second session in a week, Sanmatar Shakor
    went on to say that the assembly would "determine the future of the Minmatar people,
    whatever their tribe and wherever they may live."


    Parliament members reacted to the call with sustained applause. Chants of approval
    were heard by government supporters, who represented a comfortable majority in
    the chamber. Others in the room looked less enthusiastic, with members of the
    emerging ''democratist'' faction, for example, seen to argue furiously among themselves.


    A spokesman for the Sanmatar later admitted that Shakor has been quietly working
    toward holding a tribal assembly ever since he took office. According to the spokesman
    the official statuses of the Thukker, Starkmanir and Nefantar tribes have been
    the main stumbling blocks on the path to that goal, presenting a number of issues
    which Shakor had been hoping to resolve before making an announcement. Increasing
    political pressure and domestic strain stemming from the rising population are
    understood to have forced Sanmatar Shakor''s hand, leading to today''s parliamentary
    address.


    While the Starkmanir and Nefantar have both yet to appoint tribal chiefs, it is
    the Thukker Tribe''s position as a sovereign power in the Great Wildlands region
    that has proven the most delicate matter in negotiations. However, a major breakthrough
    in Minmatar-Thukker diplomacy is rumored to be close, something which informed
    sources have cited as an explanation for the Sanmatar''s call for an assembly
    of all seven tribes at this time.'
