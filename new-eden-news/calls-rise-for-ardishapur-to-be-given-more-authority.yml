    Ardishapur's speaking tour winds down, an upswell of support for the Royal Heir
    has led to calls he be given expanded influence over the Empire's affairs.\n\nPerhaps
    inspired by the open courts Lord Ardishapur has held in his own domains, many
    have suggested that Ardishapur be given judiciary powers across the Empire. Many
    supporters have also pointed to the \"near-miraculous\" recovery of the Ammatar
    Mandate as reason for an expansion of Ardishapur's powers.\n\nCurrently, the calls
    remain disjointed and disunited. Though they appear to be gaining momentum, they
    remain a small, but vocal minority among Ardishapur's supporters. \"Lord Ardishapur
    has said some wise things and his voice is to be given respect,\" stated one Holder,
    \"but we must temper our expectations. It is unlikely the balance of Imperial
    power would shift so dramatically in his favor.\"\n\nArdishapur himself has gently
    rebuked those making the requests. \"While the calls to expand my authority are
    made with the best intentions, it is neither my place nor that of the coalition
    to request it. It is only the Empress who may make such an appointment. While
    I would gladly serve should I be called on, as I have in the Mandate, it would
    be unseemly of me to seek more power.\""
