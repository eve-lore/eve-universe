- body: "Independent observers have validated that the Takamatsu Trading Exchange
    has been dumping garbage into their starbase, confirming the worst fears of the
    native population. Approximately 4.5 million units of garbage were dumped by the
    sixth planet, and while most was burned up in atmosphere, a substantial amount
    has been drifting around the moons of the sixth planet for two days now. Children's
    toys, biomass, fertilizer, tobacco products, and waste debris from dozens of planets
    now dim the light from the system's primary. Rumors have surfaced of prominent
    Obe citizens searching for mercenaries to stop the garbage dumping. \n\nObe system's
    residents, among them several prominent fringe merchants, are not happy with the
    actions of the Takamatsu corporation. The day before yesterday the sentiment quickly
    grew to violence as the \u201CNBSI\u201D alliance opened fire on a Takamatsu Bustard
    tender, quickly destroying the ship while the Takamatsu leader ordered the rest
    to dock and return to the starbase. \n\nAmong the comments slung around local
    were seemingly hostile comments about the Caldari State. Lunas Feelgood, of NBSI,
    stated, \u201CNBSI is in control of this area and the Caldari navy is not here,\u201D
    to which the Takamatsu leader called his actions \u201Cpiracy,\u201D. Lunas Feelgood
    responded \u201CAgain this is not piracy its simply murder.\u201D \n\nFeelgood's
    sentiments were mirrored in his fellow pod-pilots. \u201CNo matter how bloated
    your egos are,\u201D the TAKA leader said, \u201Cyou're not the rulers here. The
    Caldari State is. You can expect some consequences.\u201D \u201CWe wait for those
    with open arms,\u201D pilot Gazmus stated, while his fellow pilot Philip Sterling
    put bluntly, \u201Cthey may have sovereignty, but we have the confirmation of
    several kills\u201D \n\nThe Caldari State has yet to release an official statement
    on the matter."
