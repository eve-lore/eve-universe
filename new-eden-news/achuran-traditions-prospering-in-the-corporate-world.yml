    new star that has become visible in the star field across the cluster, participation
    in a number of Achura Stargazer mystical sects has seen a marked rise over the
    past few weeks. Shuuranien Olkkunen, a monk of the obscure Teur sect was quite
    sanguine in his explanation the phenomenon. \"It is a symbol. Its mystery and
    wonder serve to remind us that all that we know of the Universe is not all that
    there is to the Universe.\" \n\nEver ones to capitalize on a trend, several Caldari
    entrepreneurs have begun offering a new business thinking course using the stellar
    object as its inspiration. Based on an old Achura meditative custom seldom seen
    practiced in recent decades, the course teaches its students methods of marshaling
    their thought processes for use in the corporate world. It is also believed that
    one practicing such techniques will find great fortune bestowed upon them. Bradner
    Ventannien, one of the course's instructors said, \"By clearing the mind and focusing
    the thoughts, your spirit shines as brightly as the new light in the heavens.
    That brightness intrudes upon the consciousness of others, and you will be seen
    more favourably in their eyes. How can this not be of benefit to you when it comes
    time to hand out promotions?\" \n\nBut many senior corporate officials are critical
    of this new craze, and insist that workers will do better to invest their money
    more wisely and focus their minds on their jobs rather than on some mystic hokum.
    However, the peculiar phenomenon continues to defy scientific explanation and
    as time passes merges deeper into the lives of people throughout New Eden in unexpected
    ways."
