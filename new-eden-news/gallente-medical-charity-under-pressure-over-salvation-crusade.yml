- body: 'Pator - The Gallente charity, Aidonis Medical, claimed today that the Minmatar
    Republic government is applying "subtle but definite pressure" against aiding
    Cleric Abel Jarek''s Salvation Crusade movement. The humanitarian aid division
    of the respected Aidonis Foundation, Aidonis Medical has deployed hundreds of
    doctors and volunteers to Pator and other Minmatar systems since the immigration
    increases to the Minmatar Republic in early YC110.


    Tensions between the government and Aidonis Medical are reported to arise from
    differing views on the handling and discussion of the humanitarian situation in
    the Republic. The charity group refers to the growing townships in suburban Minmatar
    areas as "refugee camps," despite the government''s insistence that they are "merely
    holding and transit camps for returning Minmatar." These tensions were heightened
    by Dr. Arturio Kiervalani, a volunteer medic with Aidonis Medical, who spoke about
    the riot in which the Salvation Crusade''s chapel was burned down. Dr. Kiervalani
    has since returned to the Federation after his license to practice medicine in
    the Republic was revoked.


    Dr. Verigold Sarsou, speaking for Aidonis Medical, stated that her organization
    was placed under "insidious pressure" to withdraw medical and humanitarian aid
    workers from the Salvation Crusade compound. "Needless to say, we have resisted
    this and will continue our work amongst all Minmatar refugees," said Dr. Sarsou.
    A spokesman for the Republic government denied these claims. The spokeman refused
    to discuss the case of Dr. Kiervalani, insisting that it was a confidential matter.'
