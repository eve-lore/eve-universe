    Democratic and Constitutional Order**\n\nVillore, Essence  - President Jacus Roden
    has promised that continuity of democracy under the Federation Constitution remains
    his \"first priority\" in an address to the Federal Senate. Describing the holding
    of elections as \"absolutely essential\" and his personal relinquishment of power
    to the next president as \"my greatest desire as a citizen\", President Roden
    expressed his view that a date should be set by the Federal Elections Commission
    no later than the end of the month.\n\nThe Presidential Address ranged across
    a number of topics connected to the 27th February Attacks and their aftermath.
    President Roden updated the Senate on the continued progress in restoring system-
    and planetary-level communications networks to full capacity, following the resumption
    of parity of communication across the federal networks. The Senate also heard
    that the Federal Security Council would be lowering the alert status of the Federal
    military from an effective \"war footing\" to what the President described as
    \"a more prudent emergency status that will avoid unnecessary risks.\"\n\nWhile
    the President emphasized his \"deep yearning to bring the perpetrators of these
    heinous crimes to justice\", he reported that investigative efforts were in a
    preliminary phase of gathering evidence from a \"very large number of affected
    locations, distributed networks and virtualized datastructs.\" The Senate also
    took a vote endorsing the ongoing emergency measures and operations of the Federal
    Administration.\n\n**House Sarum and Allies Land Reinforcements on Southern Floseswin
    IV as Amarr Militia Maintain System Control**\n\nFloseswin, Metropolis  - House
    Sarum has been landing large numbers of reinforcements at the occupied cities
    and towns its forces control on Floseswin IV, following sustained system control
    by Amarr militia and the establishment of orbital dominance over Southern Floseswin
    IV. As well as a considerable number of House Sarum and 24th Imperial Crusade
    ground forces, the reinforcement groups include troops from a variety of other
    Amarr military organizations.\n\nIn an unmistakable sign of House Sarum's commitment
    to the struggle for Floseswin IV, Lady Kiyshara Sarum, a member of the Sarum Royal
    Family, has arrived in command of the 12th Lance of the Sarum House Guards. Lady
    Kiyshara, a cousin of Empress Jamyl I, is also accompanied by a large contingent
    of Cult of St. Jamyl Militants. Even more notably, House Ardishapur has also committed
    a member of its royal line, Lord Ottakar Ardishapur. Forces deployed by House
    Ardishapur include the 19th Ammatar Consular Brigade and a chapter of the Flagellant
    Order of St. Arkon.\n\nOther forces include a mixed force of Royal Uhlans, Asbara
    Cyber Knights and Khanid Zealotic Sikarrs led by the notorious warlord Cardinal
    Duke Alar Chakaid. A full Commandery of the Order of St. Tetrimon is also present,
    bringing with it three cohorts of Tetrimonic Kameiras. The markedly religious
    flavor of many of the military formations reinforcing the House Sarum occupation
    is considered \"an ominous sign\" by military historians and analysts specializing
    in Amarr doctrines of warfare.\n\n**CONCORD Conflict Monitors Gain Access to Devastated
    Coastal Town in Southern Floseswin as Amarr Forces Retake Littoral Zones**\n\nSouthern
    Continent, Floseswin IV  - Amarr forces under Colonel General Vikhtor Mazari have
    escorted a CONCORD conflict monitoring team to the destroyed coastal town of Northflow
    Bay, following the successful retaking of a broad sweep of the littoral zones
    connecting the three main Amarr occupation zones. The monitoring team has reported
    a confirmation of the destruction of the town by antimatter device detonating
    in an airburst over the settlement.\n\nHouse Sarum forces were able to push back
    the Republic Command's Southern Army Group as Minmatar positions on the coast
    became untenable under offshore and orbital bombardment. Establishment of space
    superiority by 24th Imperial Crusade forces has led Valklear General Kanth Filmir
    to retrench his lines across terrain the Minmatar can more readily defend. The
    majority of Minmatar gains made in the recent offensive remain secure as both
    sides reorient and reinforce.\n\nGeneral Mazari asserted that Northflow Bay's
    civilian population had \"either fled the fighting or been massacred by rebel
    partisans,\" at a recorded briefing of the CONCORD monitoring team on site. \"Northflow
    Bay was an entirely military and valid target at the time of its destruction by
    our strategic submarine forces. We could not allow a vital supply node to remain
    in enemy hands. The missile strike was legal under interstellar norms but more
    importantly entirely justified under our own laws of war,\" General Mazari claimed.\n\n**In
