    Federation Navy officials have reported to local media that contact with the CreoDron
    team cannot be established. The Navy is claiming to have only just recently located
    the site of the wormhole, which they believe Prof. Burreau and her team have entered,
    aiming to explore the other side.


    "Immediately upon securing the facility, we set about establishing a priority
    commlink with Professor Burreau," stated one military official. "We have not yet
    been able to make contact with her team, nor the drones that initially entered
    the system. For now, the best we can do is wait and hope."'
