    news as more Gallente Presidential election candidate declare and CONCORD intelligence
    identifies a new threat from the Templis Dragonaurs and Vimoksha Chorus terrorist
    organizations.\n\n \n\n**Templis Dragonaurs Pact With Vimoksha Chorus a \"Clear
    Threat to New Eden\" says CDIA**\n\nYulai, Genesis - The CONCORD Intelligence
    Directive Agency has described a new pact between two terror and piracy groups
    as a \"clear threat to the security of New Eden\". The CDIA has confirmed reports
    that the Templis Dragonaurs, an ultranationalist Caldari terrorist organization,
    has been identified as working with the Vimoksha Chorus, a pirate group that is
    a splinter faction of Sansha's Nation.\n\nThe CDIA assesses that the two organizations
    are presently \"engaged in an exchange of military technology and armaments, in
    an effort that can only make both these dangerous and unpredictable terror groups
    even more of a threat than they already represent.\" CONCORD's DED has responded
    by distributing all location and tracking data on the Templis Dragonaurs to the
    general security networks of the empires and encouraged capsuleers to join in
    fighting the new threat.\n\nProvost Marshal Kasiha Valkanir of CONCORD's AEGIS
    division additionally commented, \"We cannot afford to allow this nascent alliance
    between two dangerous but relatively minor threats to grow into a major new security
    crisis. The ongoing Triglavian invasions, the danger of Drifter attacks and incursions
    by Sansha's Nation itself could only be harder to counter with yet another such
    threat on the scene.\"\n\nThe Templis Dragonaurs are an ultra-nationalist Caldari
    organization considered terrorists by most governments of New Eden. Once associated
    with Tibus Heth's Provist government, they suffered a major blow when his regime
    fell in YC115. It is believed they maintain large numbers of infiltrators and
    agents throughout the Caldari State and its megacorps.\n\nLed by a former Sansha's
    Nation warlord, Cornelius Sedek, the Vimoksha Chorus is understood to have survived
    the suppression of Sansha's Nation by a CONCORD-led coalition in YC37. The Vimoksha
    Chorus operated as a pirate group for many decades before its recent escalation
    to planetary raidng. It is believed to still be an independent splinter faction
    at odds with Sansha Kuvakei's Nation.\n\n \n\n**Governor Celes Aguard Formally
    Declares Candidacy for Gallente President at Rally on Mies IV**\n\nMies, Essence
    \ - Addressing a capacity crowd at the New Riennes Stadium on Mies IV, Governor
    Celes Aguard formally declared her candidacy for President of the Gallente Federation
    in a speech that focused particular attention on the periphery of the Gallente
    territories. \"My friends, I can confirm my campaign for the Presidency of the
    Federated Union of Gallente Prime is underway, here, tonight. I welcome you all
    and thank you for sharing in my vision of the future prosperity and security of
    this great, liberal and forward-looking federation of ours.\"\n\nAs Governor of
    Mies, Celes Aguard presides over the administration of one of the Federation's
    most prosperous core systems and has long been a driving force in the development
    of her system and the wider infrastructure of the Crux constellation and Essence
    region. Despite this, Governor Aguard has long been popular in the periphery of
    the Gallente Federation, with her support for the development and security of
    outlying systems and constellations a repeated theme of her political careers.\n\n\"My
    friends, my fellow citizens, we must never forget our families, friends and fellows
    who make their lives on the frontiers of this great federation. Never again can
    the threat of political abandonment and security apathy over the periphery be
    allowed to take root in the federal system. I pledge that no region, no constellation
    and no system will be left behind. The Gallente Federation is for all, not just
    the core systems. It gladdens my heart to see so many of you here, so many of
    you citizens of Mies, Luminaire and Crux, to support our cause of a Federation
    of peace, prosperity and security for all.\"\n\nDespite two previous attempts
    that saw her fall short, Governor Aguard is considered a strong presidential candidate
    with name recognition and overall approval ratings that most other candidates
    struggle to match.\n\n \n\n**Councillor Wayaki Kayara Announces Run at Presidency
    on Return from Kabar to Mannar Seginde**\n\nMannar, Everyshore  - Councillor Wayaki
    Kayara of Mannar Seginde has announced his own run at the Gallente presidency,
    following his return to Mannar Seginde (Leremblompes II) after a visit to the
    former Mannar homeworld of Kabar (Mannar VIII). The Mannar Councillor of Diplomacy
    made his announcement from the steps of the Mannar Seginde Council of Notables
    building in Fou Mannai, \"The people of the Federation know that we can only prevail
    and make progress by righting the wrongs of the past, and it is in that spirit
    that I announce my candidacy for President of the Gallente Federation.\"\n\n\"All
    of us have seen the devastation on our homeworld, the legacy of the Doa dea Kabar,
    and many of us have experienced that legacy first hand. I have just returned from
    Kabar and I bring a message of hope that an old wrong may be righted and our ancient
    home be restored to us. The initiative to restore Kabar has made such progress
    as you would not dare hope for. That I dared not hope for. Yet it requires more
    from us all and, I say, from this Federation that so long neglected Kabar and
    only rewarded the service of so many Mannar in its cause with limited aid to us
    here on Mannar Seginde.\"\n\n\"This is not just about us. We know how the Federation
    speaks of equality and justice for all yet seldom delivers it in full to those
    who maintain their own cultures. We have seen how the Intaki home system and Placid
    region have been treated. We have seen how the Minmatar diaspora has been marginalized.
    How the Federation has allowed war to continue across our own borders and those
    of our Republic allies. We have seen how our Deteis, Civire and Achura citizens
    have been affected by the ongoing conflicts. We must stop all this. Reconciliation
    beyond our borders, with the Intaki Syndicate and, yes, with the Caldari State
    is necessary. But so too is reconcilitation necessary within. With our Jin-Mei
    friends, with our Intaki brothers and sisters, and with us, the people of Mannar
    Seginde and Kabar.\"\n\nTwo former presidential candidates expressed mixed views
    on Kayara's platform. Long-time Federal-Populist and anti-war figure, Senator
    Vilard Garioss of Nexus said, \"I sympathize with some of Councillor Kayara's
    positions, even support them, but his message seemed confused to me and I have
    a hard time believing it will resonate beyond his core following.\" Retired Admiral
    Daren Fasio, an ethnic Mannar himself, was more forthright in his assessment,
    \"This was a blancmange of a speech. No doubt it will appeal to pacifists and
    fools. I doubt that the Mannar men and women I served with would find anything
    appealing in it, let alone the citizens of the Federation who understand that
    a strong defense requires us to confront our enemies, not 'reconcile' with them.\"\n\n
    \n\n**Mentas Blaque Comments on Roden Administration 's Militia Warzone Diplomacy
    in Clear Appeal to Hawks**\n\nRenyn, Essence - In off the cuff remarks today,
    Federal Intelligence Office chief Mentas Blaque said, \"The Federation cannot
    afford to take a weak position on the debate over our sanctions against the Amarr
    Empire and its satellite states.\" His comments, made to journalists at an FIO
    briefing on the Templis Dragonaurs and Vimoksha Chorus situation, continued: \"I
    have advised against pursuing a strategy of legalistic debate with the Amarr.
    I know Sirdan xer Qosh well. He's a slippery fox who will tie up these negotiations
    in all sorts of arcane knots and twists.\"\n\nWhile Blaque's comments included
    a criticism of Amarr Inner Circle Delegate Sirdan xer Qosh's assertion that Federation
    and Republic sanctions are a breach of the Yulai Accords and Convention provisions
    against a general trade blockade of a member state by other member states, most
    Gallente commentators see the remarks as a clear criticism of the Roden Administration's
    attempt to chart a diplomatic course through the militia warzone crisis.\n\n\"These
    remarks are on the edge of open criticism of President Roden's policy in this
    matter and given the looming election, I believe they are a clear appeal to hawkish
    political blocs and voter sentiments across the Federation,\" Senator Ulve Fabronne
    of Peccanouette told the Scope's Galactic Hour. \"I think we will see Blaque declare
    very soon,\" Senator Fabronne added.\n\n \n\n**In Other News**\n\n  * CONCORD
