- body: "Ishukone Corporation held a brief press conference this morning on their
    Malkalen HQ where the following press release was issued; no questions by the
    press were allowed.   \n  \nOn the rumours about the Insorzapine bisulfate:   \n
    \ \n\"As Special Counsel Tar Maurisi\u2019s investigation clearly shows, Insorzapine
    bisulfate in the form that Zainou Biotech developed it does not serve as a Vitoc
    antidote.\"   \n  \n\"Whatever additional knowledge and information outlaw citizen
    Ullia Hnolku possessed and carried with him when his ship was destroyed by Caldari
    patriots in the Magiko system; whatever knowledge outlaw citizen Eckarine Mitumi-Hnolku
    posses and may or may not have given under coercion to the Blood Raider Covenant;
    whatever further research said Covenant may have carried out on the substance
    is not in Zainou\u2019s possession.\"   \n  \n\"Furthermore, we would like to
    point out that even if the prototype stolen by outlaw citizens Hnolku and Mitumi-Hnolku
    could be turned into a Vitoc antidote, such an antidote would not by itself cause
    mass coordinated riots in a matter of minutes after being disseminated on the
    atmosphere. This somewhat suggests the presence of something more than a simple
    antidote.\"   \n  \n\"In any event, neither Zainou Biotech nor Ishukone Corporation
    consider themselves in any way accountable for what uses a pirate organization
    gives to a substance they have developed with whatever help they tortured away
    from an outlaw Caldari citizen.\"   \n  \nOn the rumours about expected increased
    prices for transcranial microcontrollers:   \n  \n\"Roughly a year ago the Khanid
    Kingdom decided to cancel their purchase of our product. It was explained to us
    that the price of the chips was now so high that it \u201Ccounteracted the benefits
    the chips provided in economical terms for controlling human labour since they
    had better options.\"   \n  \n\"This was of course both an intelligent decision
    from their part and their right in the free market economy we enjoy, since any
    smart customer should always choose the most cost-effective solution\u2026 At
    that time, an agreement between both parts to cancel future purchases was reached.\"
    \  \n  \n\"If the current situation somehow makes our product to be again the
    most cost-effective solution to our client\u2019s problem, then it will be in
    the benefit of all parts involved to continue with said contract, with the price
    that actual market forces dictate. Ishukone does not decide what products are
    needed, or the price of those products: the market does.\""
