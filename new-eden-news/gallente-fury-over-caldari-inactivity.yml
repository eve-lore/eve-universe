- body: "Following the news that the Caldari State had declined to offer any kind
    of compensations or aid to the victims of the foul Protein Delicacies, Gallenteans
    everywhere have expressed their outrage and shock. For the last few years the
    relations between the two nations has been steadily improving, but all that has
    been carefully built up in that time is now under threat of being undone. The
    Federation Senate has been in uproar since the Caldari made their decision and
    many senators have been extremely outspoken on the matter, talking about anything
    from trade boycotts to renewing the war. The official stance of the Federal cabinet
    has been less severe, it has expressed it sadness that the Caldari were unwilling
    to lend a helping hand, or even accept their responsibility in the matter. But
    anonymous government officials have hinted that the President is deliberating
    ways to \u2018get back\u2019 at the Caldari. Only time can tell what these actions,
    if any, will be."
