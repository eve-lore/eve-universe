- body: "Yesterday saw the most heated Senate sessions in years, as Souro Foiritan
    clashed with the leaders of the Senate in an attempt to push through constitutional
    changes allowing him to run again for the presidency in two years time. Foiritan\u2019s
    ambition is to stay in office until a full and decisive victory can be called
    in the fight against the UDI. The president is rallying all the support he can
    in the Senate in a bid to overturn the stranglehold the Sociocrats have on it.
    Favors are being called in and rumors suggest that Foiritan systematically lined
    up face-to-face meetings with wavering and neutral senators in order to work his
    charm on them.   \n  \nOn the other end of the spectrum, Mentas Blaque, leader
    of the Sociocrats, worked diligently to thwart Foiritan\u2019s plans, using his
    own extensive network of friends and lobbyists. The tug of war climaxed with a
    verbal argument between the two antagonists inside the Senate hall itself, where
    Blaque accused Foiritan of \u2018improperly muscling in on the legislative territory\u2019,
    while Foiritan fired back that Blaque was simply \u2018using every opportunity
    to sensationalize every trivial matter like it was a question of life or death\u2019.
    \  \n  \nThe end result was something that could either be called personal victories
    or defeats for both Foiritan and Blaque, as Foiritan didn\u2019t manage to get
    enough Senatorial votes for his bill to pass, but got a compromise deal where
    an independent committee of law experts will be formed to discuss the matter and
    make suggestions. All parties are anxious for this committee to conclude its business
    as soon as possible, so results are expected in few days. Such are the fast and
    furious workings of the Gallente democracy.   \n  \nIn related news one of the
    top political advisors of president Foiritan has resigned. Though the official
    explanation states this was due to health reasons, it is widely believed that
    Foiritan is ridding himself of those aides that don\u2019t support his reelection
    bid. Indeed, many analysts claim that this can turn out to be a major blunder
    for Foiritan that might cost him dearly in the long run."
