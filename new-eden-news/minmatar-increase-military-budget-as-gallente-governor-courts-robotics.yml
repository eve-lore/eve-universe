    Republic Military Spending Puts Pressure on Amarr Empire\n\nThe Minmatar Tribal
    Assembly has voted to allocate increased funds to the Republic military. The decision
    follows a recent influx of resources from Thukker-led Phased Field operations
    in the Great Wildlands.\n\nThe Great Wildlands has offered the Republic unique
    access to nullsec occurrences of Phased Fields, while other major Factions have
    only been able to reap the benefits of lowsec instances. The Thukker Tribe, who
    control the Great Wildlands, are members of the Minmatar Republic and have shared
    this bounty with their fellow Matari. The Thukker vote for further Republic military
    support was uncharacteristic for the tribe\u2019s Chief Ennar Aeboul, who is known
    for his desire to maintain Thukker independence. Thukker Chief Ennar Aeboul told
    reporters, \u201CThere has been a growing influence from criminal organizations
    in recent years, and we have felt this impact on our caravans. I have come to
    see the benefits of some, albeit limited, cooperation with the Fleet.\u201D\n\nNews
    of the increases in military spending has led to unrest in the Amarr Empire. Houses
    Sarum and Kador have submitted a joint petition to the Royal court, requesting
    that the Empire match the Minmatar\u2019s increased investment. The Houses Khanid
    and Tash-Murkon are thought to oppose this suggestion out of concern over the
    economic stress it might place on the Empire. Economic analysts from Hedion University
    have suggested that if the petition passes, it is the lowest echelons of Amarr
    society that are likely to pay the price for this increased economic pressure.\n\nWhile
    the petition is still under consideration, Empress Catiz I herself has called
    the vote \u201Can unprovoked sign of aggression.\u201D Sanmatar Malteau Shakor
    has responded that \u201Cthe Republic\u2019s intention is to secure growth,\u201D
    dismissing what he called \u201Dbaseless posturing\u201D.\n\n![Bourynes University](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/6vUGWT1W2dqkWjqCWfBjhi/a6cd61ef731480c4eefc63b6be2946c0/Bourynes_University.png)\n###
    Gallente Governor Says Restricting Scientific Exploration Is Not the Solution
    to Rogue Drone Emergence\n\nThe Governor of Bourynes, Alix Moreau, gave a controversial
    speech at the University of Callie on Robotics and AI regulations. The speech,
    which has rapidly spread across the Gallente Federation, being replayed on holoreels
    throughout the nation. \n\nAccording to the Governor, \u201COur problem is not
    one of restraint, but understanding. Limitations placed on the Scientific Community
    by political entities and corporate loyalists have barred us from understanding
    the nature of Rogue Drones. Why do these spontaneous outbreaks of hostile intelligences
    occur? Why are the intelligences hostile at all? These are not questions we can
    answer unless we are free to explore.\n\nAlix Moreau, a radical believer in the
    importance of freedom of thought and self-determination, has managed to secure
    her political position due to overwhelming support from the scientific community,
    of which she was once a member. She served as an Assembly member on her home planet
    of Intaki Prime, as well as the head of the union of scientific researchers within
    the University of Callie, before being elected to Governor of Bourynes.\n\nHer
    speech has been shared by both those who adore and despise Moreau\u2019s position.
    Former-President Aguard has called it \u201Ca reckless step too far\u201D, and
    rising star Senator Lucas Tenzin said it was \u201Cwoefully naive, bordering on
    anti-human.\u201D Meanwhile, CreoDron representatives have called the speech \u201Can
    important perspective worth listening to\u201D, and the leader of the Intaki Autonomists,
    Jonas Ivestara, released a statement referring to the speech as \u201Cone of our
    greatest minds exercising her most fundamental of rights\u201D. \n\nMoreau\u2019s
    interests in determination and Intaki heritage have seen many Intaki come out
    in support of her, despite the fact that her radical views may clash with the
    opinions of some of the Assembly's biggest parties. It seems that while she may
    not always have the backing of the people of her home planet, they are proud to
    claim her when facing the rest of the Federation. When asked if she would support
    the demilitarization of Intaki, Moreau responded, \u201CThat is for the people
    of Intaki to decide, no one else\u201D.\n\n### News in Brief\n\n- Federation Administration

    with Jita executives over administrative funds.\n\n- Tash-Murkon celebrates first
    anniversary of their victory over Drifters.\n\n- FIO vows to continue managing
