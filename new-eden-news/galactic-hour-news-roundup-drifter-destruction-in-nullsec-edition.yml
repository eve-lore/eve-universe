    news from all across New Eden as the Drifters assault a wide spread of nullsec
    systems and are reported sieging multiple capsuleer structures.\n\n**Sudden Drifter
    Offensive in Outer Regions Takes CONCORD and Capsuleers by Surprise**\n\nYulai,
    Genesis  - Drifter strike forces have been attacking at least 70 star systems,
    spread across the Outer Regions of New Eden's nullsec space, for the last two
    days, [reports the Scope's Alton Haveri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD_usNKF9Yo).
    Accounts from nullsec have confirmed assaults by multiple Drifter fleets in over
    20 regions. Areas as far apart as Period Basis and Cobalt Edge have been struck
    by raiding forces of Drifter cruisers and battleships, with every quadrant of
    the Outer Regions suffering multiple and repeated attacks.\n\n[![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/drifters_assault_nullsec.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD_usNKF9Yo)
    \ \n_Drifters attacking structures in nullsec as well as capsuleer ships (The
    Scope with Alton Haveri)_\n\nCONCORD has only commented that it is  \"aware of
    the situation and monitoring developments\", while neither the Directive Enforcement
    Department's Star Marshal Kjersidur Elladall nor the AEGIS devision's Provost
    Marshal Kasiha Valkanir would respond to requests for interviews or comment on
    the sudden Drifter attacks. Sources within the DED have indicated to the Scope's
    Galactic Hour with Ret Gloriaxx that CONCORD's military, law enforcement and security
    forces are entirely focused on the Triglavian invasion in the core regions.\n\nAs
    one anonymous source commented to Ret Gloriaxx, \"After all, we're concerned with
    the safety of decent citizens of civilized worlds. These capsuleer warlords and
    pirate groups don't respect the law so I guess they can look after themselves.\"\n\n
    \n\n**Triglavian Invasion Sparks Alerts as Luminaire and Caldari Border Zone Attacked
    Simultaneously**\n\nLuminaire, Essence  - Serious tensions were raised and alerts
    sparked on both sides of the Caldari-Gallente border as two Triglavian invasion
    forces appeared to operate in tandem to create an invasion zone that stretched
    from the Gallente Crux constellation, across the Caldari Border Zone, and as far
    as the Caldari constellation of Kantanen.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/border_invasion_cal_gal.png)
    \ \n_Two Triglavian Invasion Forces Link Up Across Caldari Border Zone (The Scope
    's Galactic Hour with Ret Gloriaxx)_\n\nState forces in the Caldari Border Zone
    were already at a high level of readiness and immediately mobilized and deployed
    across the zone. The Caldari Navy has ordered the Kantanen reserves to stand by
    and corporate security forces are deploying in neighboring constellations.\n\nIn
    the Federation, the presence of Triglavian invasion scouts in Luminaire prompted
    President Jacus Roden to order the Luminaire Defense Fleet to high alert at deployed
    positions in the system. Gallente Prime and Caldari Prime planetary defense forces
    are fully mobilized and orbital defenses have been placed on a war footing. Command
    Admiral Auvier Bauvon of the Crux Defense Zone has moved his center of operations
    to Auberulle and Tripwire Operations are in effect.\n\nThe tensions at the border
    are acute but both empires are co-ordinating in full awareness of the common enemy.
    Non-capsuleer interplanetary traffic is at a minimum and capsuleers are reported
    to be responding across the conjoined invasion zones.\n\n \n\n**Intaki Syndicate
    and ORE \"Alarmed and Concerned\" by Drifter Situation in Nullsec**\n\n4C-B7X,
    Outer Ring - The Scope's Galactic Hour with Ret Gloriaxx has learned that senior
    figures within the Intaki Syndicate and ORE are \"alarmed and concerned by the
    Drifter attacks\" across nullsec regions close and far from their own regions.
    The Intaki Syndicate's Space Police are also dealing with the impact of a Triglavian
    invasion in neighboring Placid region, with Triglavian scouts active in the Syndicate
    system of PF-346.\n\nMining operations run or sponsored by ORE in the Outer Ring
    have been reduced, and in some cases withdrawn, as the Drifters indiscriminately
    attack any ship or structure they encounter in nullsec. The Syndicate has reported
    a severe slowdown in trade flowing from the Outer and Cloud Rings, and through
    their region to the Gallente Federation. Non-capsuleer traffic is severely restricted
    and the movements of capsuleers are unpredicatable as they contend with the attacking
    Drifters.\n\n \n\n**Ishukone Challenges Onikanabo Brigade Actions on Intaki V
    at Caldari Business Tribunal**\n\nMaurasi, The Forge  - The Ishukone Corporation
    has entered a formal complaint over the actions of the Onikanabo Brigade on Intaki
    V. Ishukone are seeking a lien to freeze Onikanabo transports and materiel still
    present on the planet, pending a judgment for relief on the basis that the Brigade's
    \"corporate reparations\" operations harmed the megacorporation's interests on
    Intaki V.\n\nSpecial Corporate Counsel Majima Umokka appeared for Ishukone and
    entered the petition for relief before the CBT's Panel of Receivers for the \"Placid
    Conflict Zone Franchise System.\" Special Counsel Umokka also attached several
    corporate ethics violations charges against the Onikanabo Brigade and \"any clients,
    partners or sponsors as yet unknown and unspecified who are party to their gross
    criminality and abuse of corporate law.\" As the Scope's Galactic Hour with Ret
    Gloriaxx has reported, the Brigade is said to have \"sacked a dozen Ida monasteries
    and burned down a score of attached villages and communal plantations.\"\n\nThe
    Onikanabo Brigade has not responded to the complaint or charges made by Ishukone
    Corporation. Latest reports from Intaki V indicate that the Brigade's convoys
    from the areas it allegedly raided have stopped, and its forces have withdrawn
    behind fortified positions surrounding the occupied Kainta Yavaat Transorbital
    Launch Facility.\n\n \n\n**In Other News**\n\n  * Ammatar Mandate Forces Under
