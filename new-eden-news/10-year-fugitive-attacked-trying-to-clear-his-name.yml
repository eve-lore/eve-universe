    In fact they are considered the second safest classification of space in the Universe.
    However earlier tonight (Wednesday) there was a well organised and well co-ordinated
    attack in Renyn.   \n  \nYesterday was the 10 year commemoration of the death
    of Gregory Malubrian, a pilot who was killed, without a clone, at the Duripant
    gate in Renyn. The pilot who is credited with his death is Tinus Janatus. Concord
    records state that he was killed straight after his attack on Gregory, but he
    has had to remain hidden from the vengeance of the family whom Gregory had left
    behind.   \n  \nHowever, tonight he was trying to clear his name. Meeting at the
    gate where Malubrian was killed with a reporter from the Scope, Silvia Frinor,
    who has a long standing reputation for uncovering the truth behind some of the
    universes most prominent miscarriages of justice.   \n  \nTinus was very jumpy
    for the entire encounter. He had obviously taken a great leap of faith meeting
    in such a high security zone. He kept making references to \u201Cthose pilots\u201D
    who were watching him, despite the fact that no-one was around.   \n  \nHe proceeded
    to spill out how he was forced into the murder, against his will. Details about
    who and why he was forced weren\u2019t forthcoming. Frinor, with her experience
    in journalism managed to finally coax out the name of a corporation, the \u201CMercantile
    Club\u201D.   \n  \nHis fears of being watched then proved to be well founded.
    No sooner had he uttered those words than 4 raptor interceptors uncloaked around
    the gate and proceeded to attack him. All of them were from the Mercantile Club
    Corporation.   \n  \nBoth Silvia and Tinus cried out for help. As luck would have
    it, the system was party to a higher volume of traffic than normal and many pilots
    responded to the call, including two pilots from M3g4 corporation who had been
    watching the whole exchange.   \n  \nAfter barely 5 minutes of fighting, the interceptor
    pilots struggling their very best to stay alive against a much greater force than
    they had anticipated, the Mercantile pilots were defeated. Tinus got away unscathed,
    although he has since gone back into hiding.   \n  \nLiNkIsMaXiMuS killed one
    pilot, Raisen killed another, whilst D'Artagnan destroyed two ships, and the pod
    of one of those pilots. All of them were thanked heartily by Silvia and Tinus,
    and were rewarded for their efforts. Silvia mentioned that the fact the four pilots
    uncloaked the very second that Tinus mentioned their name, means that there is
    more to this than meets the eye and will investigate as much as she can. But with
    all four pilots dead and presumably being reanimated right now, it could be an
    uphill struggle."
