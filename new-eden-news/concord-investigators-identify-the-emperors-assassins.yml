    at the Imperial Chancellor's Office, sources close to the Imperial administration
    are speaking of a major leap forward in the investigation, stating that the perpetrators
    of the Emperor's assassination have been identified.   \n  \nAs the news spreads
    throughout the Empire like wildfire, many citizens are rejoicing over the prospect
    of bringing to justice those who have committed this terrible crime. Moreover,
    a feeling of renewed rage is being felt amongst the pilot community close to the
    Empire. The general sentiment conveyed is that nothing short of revenge can put
    their minds at ease.   \n  \nMembers of the Theology Council have already commented,
    calling the news \"a sign of God's bestowing his blessing once more upon the purest
    of races.\" The Council went on to state, \"Still, it is only a small soothing
    of the pain and regret we feel at having this greatest of men so violently taken
    from us. Amarr will continue to mourn, but we will be tireless in bringing to
    justice those capable of such a crime.\"   \n  \nThe Council also addressed the
    acting regent, stating that \"the eyes of the Empire are upon you, Chamberlain.\"
    \ \nWhile the Amarr community eagerly awaits information regarding the assassination
    of their Emperor, Chamberlain Karsoth has remained behind closed doors for the
    rest of the day, unavailable for comments. It is widely believed that the Chamberlain
    will keep the identity of the assailants classified as long as possible to facilitate
    further investigations by CONCORD."
