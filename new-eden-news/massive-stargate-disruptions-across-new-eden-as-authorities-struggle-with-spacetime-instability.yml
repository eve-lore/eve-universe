- body: "Yulai, Genesis - Massive stargates disruptions across New Eden have been
    attributed by CONCORD and local authorities to their efforts to halt the collapse
    of the entire stargate network due to \"extreme spacetime instabilities\" afflicting
    star systems across the cluster. The shutdowns of regional gate networks reached
    deep into the core of New Eden's high-security space, with the Forge region experiencing
    a total shutdown and reboot late in the evening.\n\nSpacetime instabilities affecting
    stargates proximate to locations of so-called \"metaliminal storms\" were detected
    late yesterday morning, according to sources at the Secure Commerce Commission.
    Stargate maintenance crews across New Eden have been reporting dangerous shifts
    in the spacetime resonance patterns between pairs of gates as the frequency of
    power fluctuations caused by cluster-wide spatiotemporal anomalies has increased.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/Shutdown_Minmatar_Gate.jpg)
    \ \n_Above: Minmatar Republic stargate shut down under SCC protocol_\n\nThe local
    impact of metaliminal storms raised fears of cascading failure across the gate
    networks of the affected regions, leading crews to co-ordinate regional shutdown
    and restart protocols in an effort to correct the resonance pattern deviations.
    Some success in temporarily correcting for the anomalies was seen but the constant
    increase in the frequency of the power output fluctuation of the artificial wormhole
    pairings of the network continued to cause grave concerns.\n\nAn emergency session
    of the SCC's Stargate Security Directorate determined that all stargates in a
    region should be shutdown according to the protocols enacted by crews in Pure
    Blind, Tenerifis and Venal regions. Further regions impacted by metaliminal storms
    experienced resonance deviations and stargate shutdowns were Catch, Tribute, Providence,
    Fountain and Vale of the Silent.\n\nHopes that the problems would be limited to
    the outer regions affected by storms were dashed when crews in Aridia, Fountain,
    and Geminate activated the shutdown protocols as instability readings increased
    on several gates in those regions. The Khanid and Kor-Azor regions of the Amarr
    Empire also began the reboot procedure, swiftly followed by many regions in the
    outer perimeter of the cluster.\n\nUltimately, shutdowns were determined to be
    necessary across many regions of New Eden, including Heimatar, Placid and the
    Forge. The SCC's Stargate Security Directorate has deployed teams to key stargates
    across New Eden and continues to co-ordinate the response with the stargate control
    authorities of the core empires and CONCORD member states.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/Federal_Navy_Cat_Vale.png)

    Fleets Mobilize to Secure Gates Surrounding Occupied Systems**\n\nIn response
    to an escalating situation, with fears of a new Triglavian offensive sweeping
    through the population of New Eden, the core empires have deployed fleets to secure
    the gates leading to the 27 systems occupied by the Triglavian Collective.\n\nAs
    the stargate disruption crisis unfolded, the Amarr Empire was the first to mobilize,
    rushing fleets to secure stargates leading into occupied systems in the Domain
    region. The Caldari State, Gallente Federation and Minmatar Republic soon followed
    suit, with stargate security fleets deployed to key systems in the Citadel, Essence
    and Metropolis.\n\nDeployments to territories bordering the occupied systems in
    Black Rise, Derelik, Lonetrek, Molden Heath, Everyshore, Sing Laison, and the
    Citadel were also rushed from fleet reserves of all the empires. The alarm sweeping
    New Eden at the disruption of the gates has been heightened by fears this is a
    prelude to a renewed offensive by the Triglavian Collective.\n\nAdditionally,
    EDENCOM Command has reportedly ordered AEGIS commando teams to the stargates bordering
    the occupied systems amidst swirling rumors that there is a plan to physically
    destroy the stargates leading to Triglavian-held territories.\n\nAccording to
    the Scope's sources, EDENCOM's Joint Scientific Taskforce fears that shutting
    down the stargates will be insufficient to stop a cascading disruption centered
    on the occupied systems. Stargate pairings remain in a state of spacetime resonance
    even when stargate systems are fully powered down, with physical destruction or
    removal at least one stargate in a pair known to be the only sure way of totally
    severing such links.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/Republic_Fleet_Ansen_Krirald.png)
