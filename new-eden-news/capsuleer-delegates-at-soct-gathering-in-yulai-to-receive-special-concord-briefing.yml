    annual capsuleer gathering, CONCORD has announced that it will be providing a
    special briefing on recent developments concerning emerging threats to New Eden.\n\nThe
    announcement of this briefing follows the recent incident during which a heavily
    damaged vessel of unfamiliar design and unknown origin was [quarantined by CONCORD
    forces](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/concord-quarantine-ship-of-unknown-design-in-yulai/)
    under the command of DED Genesis Fleet Captain Oveg Drust. The vessel was subsequently
    docked in a secure bay within the Yulai X DED Assembly Station _._\n\nGiven this
    unprecedented event, the working assumption among the Scope 's diplomatic sources
    is that CONCORD's Inner Circle, on which the SoCT's Elder Mentor Matshi Raish
    sits, has decided to share vital intelligence with the capsuleer community of
    New Eden.\n\n![Unknown Vessel Yulai X](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/unknown_vessel_yulai_x.png)
    \ \n_Unknown vessel at anchor outside DED Assembly Station,Yulai X._\n\nIn this
    15th year since independent capsuleers were licensed under an updated Yulai Convention,
    the Society is hosting their capsuleer contact gathering in a new diplomatic facility
    constructed across the bay from Concord City, on the surface of Yulai III. In
    anticipation of the anniversary of the dawn of the capsuleer age on May 6th, the
    venue will be playing host to a number of capsuleer speakers, together with representatives
    from CONCORD, the Empires and the SoCT itself.\n\nFollowing the unknown vessel
    quarantine incident in Yulai, and the recent series of Drifter fleet incursions
    leading to [the recovery of video datastreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w7KzQBKRJc)
    that appear to show heavy fighting between similar vessels and the Drifters, speculation
    is rampant and anticipation among interested observers is high."
