    Approach Climax for New Year YC123**\n\nYulai, Genesis Region - The citizens of
    New Eden are celebrating across the cluster as the long, war-torn year of YC122
    comes to an end amidst hopes that YC123 will be a better year, despite the lingering
    influence of the Triglavian invasion and simmering conflicts in the border and
    outer regions. This year's Yoiul Festival has seen record numbers of people travel
    across the cluster to be with their families, largely due to huge numbers of troops,
    support staff and construction workers returning from counter-invasion duties
    and widespread fortification works.\n\nDespite these large movements of people,
    celebrations in many systems are notably muted due to the grievous losses suffered
    during the Triglavian invasions. The Caldari State in particular continues to
    experience political turmoil amidst the disaffection and disillusionment of a
    population that has seen long-nurtured myths of Caldari military invincibility
    shattered in the very heartlands of the State. Even still, while protests are
    certainly being held over the New Year period, some festival spirit remains among
    the resilient Caldari worker classes. Corporations specializing in brewing, distilling
    and the manufacture of legal recreational boosters have reported a brisk trade,
    even if no sales records have been shattered this year.\n\nCelebrations in the
    Federation have similarly been unusually low-key, with politicians urging that
    respect and remembrance for the lost systems and support of survivors and refugees
    are vital. Even so, many in the Federation feel that their way of life should
    not be sacrificed and are celebrating the passing of the year with some gusto.
    The story is similar in the Republic which, despite escaping the worst of the
    invasions, lost the relatively well-populated Skarkon system and the colony system
    of Krirald. However, celebrations of the passing of the years are being observed
    by those clans and tribes that have developed such traditions with respect to
    the New Eden calendar.\n\nThe Amarr Empire observes the Yoiul Festival as a holiday
    since the Emperor Heideran VII made it one under the auspices of his _Pax Amarria_
    doctrine. Even though the Empire now follows the _Pax e Kilizhi Do_ doctrine of
    Empress Catiz I, the religious observance of the festival and the New Year remains
    an important holiday. Ceremonies of thanksgiving have been held for the service
    of the Amarr military, the establishment of 35 fortress systems, and the overall
    91 system victories of the Amarr Empire; together with services of remembrance
    for the Empire's relatively light losses.\n\nCapsuleers across New Eden are also
    celebrating the New Year, with one especially notable gathering planned to be
    held in Pator at the [Eternal Flame statue in system tonight](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/event-new-year-fireworks-at-eternal-flame/287151),
    and a New Year Weekend [Starlight Ball](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/starlight-new-year-s-ball-yc-123/283580)
    planned with open invitation to EDENCOM loyalists.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/eternal_flame_pator.png)

    Appoints Tobias Efrit as Republic Prime Minister**\n\nMatar, Pator System - The
    Minmatar Republic's Tribal Council has appointed Tobias Efrit of the Krusual Tribe
    as Republic Prime Minister at its end of year meeting. Prime Minister Efrit, a
    veteran parliamentarian, replaces the retiring Khalsis Sokior of the Vherokior
    Tribe. The Tribal Council also reconfirmed and extended the emergency powers granted
    to Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor following a request for review from Chief Acassa Midular.\n\nPrime
    Minister Efrit is the current clan chief of the Oks-Efrit of the Krusual Tribe
    and has served as a member of the Republic Parliament for several terms over the
    last three decades. Efrit also served as head of the Krusual Trade Assembly for
    some years between parliamentary terms. Prime Minister Efrit is a clan cousin
    of Valklear General Kril Efrit, leader of the Skarkon Tribal Resistance Army.\n\nKhalsis
    Sokior was considered a safe pair of hands, content with the administration of
    the Republic government but faced severe challenges during the Triglavian invasions
    and the Floseswin conflict. A parliamentary insider told the Scope that, \"Sokior
    is a fine woman and able but the truth is that war is upon us, and Khalsis Sokior
    is not a wartime prime minister.\" Sokior retires with honors to her family holdings
    near Kulburis on the coast of Coricia, Matar.\n\nAmong other appointments, the
    Tribal Council also promoted Hetman General Kanth Filmir to the position of Supreme
    Commander of Republic Forces, Metropolis Region.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/organizations/31_128_2.png)\n\n_**News
    in Brief**_\n\n**Outer Region Capsuleer Coalitions Clash in Brutal Battle Over
    M2-XFE Keepstar**\n\nM2-XFE, Delve Region - Capsuleer warlord coalitions Imperium
    and PAPI have clashed in a titanic battle over a heavily fortified Keepstar in
    the M2-XFE system of the Delve region. Preliminary reports indicate the loss of
    nearly 700 capital ships, with almost 250 Titan-class vessels destroyed in one
    of the largest battles witnessed in the Outer Regions. Final tallies await confirmation
    but the scale of capital ship losses may make this the most costly battle in the
    history of capsuleer alliance warfare.\n\n**Caldari State and Megacorporation
    Forces Carry Out \"Counter-Terrorism\" Raids Across Lonetrek Region**\n\nLonetrek
    Region - Caldari State authorities are reporting a massive series of raids carried
    out across the Lonetrek region have \"successfully captured or eliminated a number
    of anarchist terrorist cells.\" Reports indicate that State Peacekeepers carried
    out operations on a number of planets, asteroid colonies and space stations in
    conjunction with Home Guard, Lai Dai Protection Services and Spacelane Patrol
    security troops. A report from Torrinos claims there was an extensive firefight
    and a series of explosions aboard the Caldari Provisions station orbiting Torrinos
    V, Moon 10. Other reports indicate a massive State and corporate security presence
    in Lonetrek population centers..  \n \n\n_**In Other News**_\n\n  * CONCORD Inner
