- body: "Yulai, Genesis - More stargate shutdowns have been taking place across regions
    surrounding the systems occupied by the Triglavian Collective under the SCC Stargate
    Security Directorate's emergency protocol. Regions affected so far are Domain,
    Molden Heath, Everyshore and several are either shut down by now or in the process
    of being shut down.\n\nEDENCOM has confirmed that AEGIS commandos are present
    on stargates connecting to the occupied systems in an attempt to carry out the
    \"ultimate contingency\", believed to be a plan to destroy the stargates. However,
    the scale of spacetime instabilities has reportedly taken AEGIS by surprise. Difficulty
    in even boarding the stargates due to the extreme nature of the gravitational
    distortions now taking place has been encountered by at least one team according
    to the Scope's Ret Gloriaxx, reporting from Ennur in Molden Heath.\n\nLocal control
    authorities and maintenance crews are also said to be out of contact with the
    outside world, hampering AEGIS efforts to secure core stargate systems and carry
    out what is assumed to be an effort to trigger massive fusion reactor overloads
    to destroy the stargate infrastructure itself. Time is evidently running out as
    potential catastrophe looms.\n\n**In Other News**\n\n  * Final Evacuation Flight
