    - As transports carrying Poksu personnel and equipment began arriving in Uphallant,
    a protest was taking place in Luminaire, with demonstrators calling upon President
    Foiritan to act decisively to address the situation.\n\nThe public has been vocal
    in its outrage, and voices of dissent have also been heard in the Gallente financial
    sector, with investors calling on the Foiritan Administration to offer government-backed
    guarantees on assets annexed by the Caldari. While the administration has not
    yet responded to these requests, beyond saying that they're \"considering all
    options,\" the President has already drawn criticism from a number of directions.
    Zemla Faudien, a recruiter for the Federal Defence Union, stated, \"Any money
    spent propping up corporate investments would be better spent actually fighting
    the damn Caldari.\" Faudien and others feel strongly that the Foiritan government
    has not done enough to support the military and militia forces.\n\nThe hawks among
    the Gallente were not alone in their criticism of the administration. Speaking
    on condition of anonymity, a senior executive at Pend Insurance remarked, \"The
    solution is not securing investments, the solution is providing a climate that
    is conducive to safe investing.\" When pressed on what that might entail, the
    executive replied: \"It's time for Foiritan to stop whipping up nationalist sentiment,
    admit we've been beaten, and sue for peace with the Caldari.\"\n\nAs of this moment
    President Foiritan's economic team has responded to the matter only by stating
    they are taking a \"wait-and-see\" approach."
