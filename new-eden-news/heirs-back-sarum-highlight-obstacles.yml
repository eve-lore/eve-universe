- body: "Ardishapur Prime - On behalf of himself and the other three remaining Heirs,
    Yonis Ardishapur today released a short statement declaring their support for
    Jamyl Sarum's immediate accession to the Imperial Throne. The text of the statement
    follows: \n\n\"On behalf of Yonis Ardishapur, Uriam Kador, Articio Kor-Azor and
    Catiz Tash-Murkon, we, the anointed Heirs of the Great Houses of the Empire, do
    hereby jointly and individually name and nominate Jamyl Sarum as our preferred
    heir to the Imperial Throne and pledge our undying fealty to her and her holy
    cause. In doing so we each waive our right to stand for Succession by Trial or
    other means. \n\n\"We commit to abiding by the judgement of the Honored Authorities
    in the matter of the Succession of Doriam II and petition them to discount our
    candidacy. In withdrawing ourselves in this way we indicate that we shall lend
    our Empress whatever support she may need and require of us in times to come,
    and that we will not directly intercede further in the Succession on behalf of
    ourselves or any other considered candidate. This does not remove or void the
    necessity of the selection of a new Chamberlain to officiate after the apparent
    abdication of Chamberlain Karsoth, or for the revered members of the Theology
    Council to validate Jamyl Sarum's legitimacy as a candidate.\""
