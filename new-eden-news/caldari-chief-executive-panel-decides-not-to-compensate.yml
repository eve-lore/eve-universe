- body: After careful scrutiny by the Chief Executive Panel into the Protein Delicacies
    crisis, it has decided not to follow through with any further actions. Offering
    a rare glimpse into the power setup of the panel, it has been revealed that the
    panel was roughly divided into three camps. In one camp, headed by the Sukuuvestaa
    Corporation, it was argued that the business practices employed in the manufacturing
    and marketing of Protein Delicacies were not untoward and in perfect harmony with
    what normally goes on in the cutthroat Caldari capitalistic economy. The second
    group, headed by the Kaalakiota Corporation, argued that the ill effects of the
    Protein Delicacies on the Gallenteans paled in comparison to the sufferings the
    Caldari had endured for centuries at the hands of the Federation, not the least
    being the loss of the Caldari home world. Only the third group, headed by the
    Ishukone Corporation, was in favor of accepting the demands for compensations,
    arguing that different principles applied to inter-stellar trade, where cooperation
    and mutual benefits should be the guiding light. But their view was the minority
    one and the consensus of the panel was to decline taking any responsibility for
    the Protein Delicacies incident. The Caldari made one small gesture of goodwill
    when they imprisoned for three years the manager responsible for the development
    of the Protein Delicacies, but on unrelated tax-based charges. It is unlikely
    that this gesture will be seen as enough by the Federation.
