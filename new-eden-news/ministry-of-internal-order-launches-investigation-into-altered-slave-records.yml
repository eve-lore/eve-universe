- body: "Dakba - The Amarrian Ministry of Internal Order has launched an investigation
    into the genealogical records of approximately 250,000 slaves belonging to Lord
    Adash Korta, Holder of the Dabka system.   \n  \nKorta is one of the largest slaveholders
    in the Amarr Empire. His estates have already freed 300,000 slaves following Empress
    Jamyl I's edict this past Thursday. Despite these numbers, Imperial officials
    noted discrepancies in the genealogical histories submitted for the remaining
    half-million slaves owned by Korta. The officials have neither revealed how the
    discrepancies were brought to light nor what their actual nature is.  \n  \nAccording
    to a statement released by Inspector Omin Bodak, the head of the investigation,
    the MIO hopes to have the case concluded within a week. \"We fully expect that
    the discrepancies will turn out to be nothing,\" he said. \"The Korta Family has
    a long record of service to the Empire and Ardishapur Family. The Ministry has
    been investigating numerous similar issues across the Empire since the Empress's
    decree. Unfortunately, records on slaves can occasionally be haphazard. This matter
    has only received the attention it has due to the high number of slaves involved.\"
    \ \n  \nThe Korta family has not responded to requests for comment."
