- body: 'Yulai - It seems that CONCORD''s cluster-wide data network is suffering a
    severe and unprecedented outage. In the last few minutes multiple core services
    have degraded or dropped offline across the EVE cluster. This appears to be linked
    to events in Yulai; communications with that system have been re-established,
    and independent pilots are reporting in again.


    We have been unable to contact or identify any vessels known to have been in the
    vicinity of the station prior to the attack. Reports suggest that multiple smaller
    engagements have broken out across the system as panicked pilots turn on local
    law enforcement vessels. It appears that at this time CONCORD is not deploying
    additional vessels into the system.
