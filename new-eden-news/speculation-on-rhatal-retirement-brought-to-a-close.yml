    Commander Gispali Rhatal, and his mysteriously blank service record. CONCORD has
    issued a final statement this morning elaborating on the missing service history,
    bringing a close to the rampant speculation about former Commander Rhatal\u2019s
    past occupation within CONCORD. \u201CClose to three years ago, Commander Rhatal
    was assigned to co-ordinate logistical movements at one of our outposts along
    the low security boarder between the Amarr Empire and the Khanid Kingdom. His
    department provided fitting and repair services for CONCORD supply ships, our
    contractors and empire corporations.\u201D The truth, it seems, is less glamorous
    than the mystery as the release continues further. \u201CAnother responsibility
    of this position is the co-ordination of supplies and their movements to and from
    the outpost itself. A job that former Commander Rhatal conducted with distinction
    before his unfortunate medical issues warranted his early retirement.\u201D The
    CONCORD statement reiterates that they regret these unfortunate administration
    errors and have offered their apologies to Mr Rhatal and the general public. Mr
    Rhatal has continued to remain silent, despite public curiosity surrounding his
    resignation and requests for comment."
