- body: '_Malkalen - Ishukone Watch officers responded to an emergency call at the
    residence of Natasha Ogemi two hours ago, where they found the Ishukone board
    member unconscious and immediately rushed her to the hospital. While the Zainou
    Executive Medical Center told reporters it was too early for a specific diagnosis,
    Ogemi is known to suffer from Mortensen''s Syndrome, a chronic neuromuscular disorder
    that can cause paralysis or, in extreme cases, coma._


    _Ogemi has been seen as the swing vote on the Ishukone board in the ongoing CEO
    decision. With her health suddenly in question, this has only further worried
    investors. "This situation has already taken far too long to resolve," said Vainela
    Omaken, a financial advisor with the Mercantile Club. "If Ogemi is unable to fulfill
    her duties, that could mean months'' more delays, something that Ishukone simply
    can''t afford anymore."_


    _There has been a massive sell-off of Ishukone stock on all major Caldari exchanges.
    The stock is already down nearly a quarter of its value and continuing to decline
    as investors panic, with no end in sight._


    _The Ishukone board has called an emergency meeting at the corporation''s Malkalen
    headquarters in response and put out a press release in an attempt to reassure
    investors, stating that they are "determined to maintain the integrity of Ishukone''s
    business operations" despite these problems._'
