- body: "The Federal Senate today agreed to lodge a formal inquiry into the scandal
    surrounding the recent revelations that the popular Protein Delicacies are actually
    made of organic waste, second grade biomass and station sewage. The inquiry will
    look into how Sukuuvestaa Corporation managed to conceal this fact, especially
    from the health organizations responsible for approving the product as suitable
    for human consumption. It is widely believed that at the bottom of this matter
    lies an even bigger scandal \u2013 corruption and bribery that cut to the core
    of the consumer economy. The inquiry will be conducted with all due haste, so
    that the public can be informed as soon as possible on what exactly is going on."
