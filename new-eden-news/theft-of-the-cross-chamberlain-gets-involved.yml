- body: "As expected, Court Chamberlain Dochuta Karsoth released the following statement
    on the situation revolving around the stolen Cross of the Sacred Throne order.
    \  \n  \n\u201CSince the Empire was founded, we have placed a great deal of emphasis
    on our traditions and customs. It is these traditions and customs that define
    the Empire and its many provinces. It seems that ironically enough, some forget
    this in their passion to support us.   \n  \n\"Holder Marin Ankigher alerted me
    to a problem several days ago. I was hoping that my involvement would not be necessary,
    and that the CVA would make the right choice out of their own volition. I see
    now that this was an idle hope.   \n  \nI ask the CVA to retrieve the Cross at
    all costs. If this means negotiating with individuals considered terrorists and
    enemies to the Amarr Empire, so be it. I ask the CVA to reconsider their refusal
    to negotiate with the individual holding the Cross of the Sacred Throne Order.
    Placing pride before this icon of culture and history is selfish and not becoming
    of an otherwise fine institution, one we appreciate and one we would like to continue
    to appreciate.\u201D   \n  \nThis statement does not come as a big surprise. Although
    the Chamberlain does not often comment on matters concerning the policies of an
    alliance of capsuleer pilots, the theft of the Cross is of such a nature that
    it has been widely believed inevitable for him not to get involved.   \n  \nWhether
    the CVA will heed the Imperial Chamberlain\u2019s request is unclear at this point."
