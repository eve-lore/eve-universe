    instalment of his \u201CHunt the Bounty\u201D challenge.   \n  \nThe second round
    of his game show style contest was played out on Thursday where another lucky
    pilot scooped the two million ISK prize money.   \n  \nAfter a thrilling chase,
    Entschlossen laid the final blow that destroyed Aslo\u2019s vessel; later donating
    his winnings to fellow capsuleer Jenny Spitfire.   \n  \nInterestingly, Aslo\u2019s
    \u201CHunt the Bounty\u201D round two was not the only occasion of interest on
    Thursday as two warring capsuleer factions were furiously battling each other
    across the New Caldari space lanes.   \n  \nSources state that both sides took
    the unusual steps of calling a temporary cease fire in order for their own pilots
    to take part in the hunt; a testament to the power of Vincent Aslo\u2019s brand
    of entertainment."
