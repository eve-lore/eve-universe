- body: 'YULAI - In a press release circulated just moments ago, DED Director of Operations
    Arve Vesren confirmed that she has placed the Directive Enforcement Department''s
    entire Genesis fleet on high alert, following widespread reports of hundreds of
    unidentified structures uncloaking across the cluster accompanied by the appearance
    of large numbers of vessels of unknown origin.


    Speaking from DED Headquarters, Vesren urged the press to remain calm as she explained
    that the entirety of the DED''s active fleet have been "placed on high alert as
    a precautionary measure, designed to improve response times in the event of incidents
    relating to newly appeared entities across the cluster."


    Continuing with her address to the assembled interstellar press, she explained
    that "while the structures that appear to have uncloaked are of unknown construction
    and are on a scale never before seen, they appear to be benign in nature, and
    at this point pose no active threat." She did however continue by stating that
    "the vessels accompanying these structures do appear to be heavily armed with
    weapons of unknown capability, and may respond aggressively if threatened or disturbed
    in any way."


    Initial reports suggest that capsuleers across the cluster have already begun
    attempting to establish contact with the newly appeared vessels. One report has
    even indicated that the mysterious new threats are fully capable of destroying
    capital ships piloted by capsuleers.'
