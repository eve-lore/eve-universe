- body: "CONCORD and DED investigators have announced that all members of the terror
    cell that hijacked a prison transport have been apprehended and that the investigation
    is now over. \n\nA statement from the office of Commander Haram Goskaktar's security
    division revealed \"when the interrogation of the two captured terrorists was
    complete it was clear that the cell was formed specifically to breach and hijack
    a prison service transport vessel. Whilst details of the transport are classified
    we can state that all passengers on board the vessel have been accounted for.\"
    \n\nIt was originally rumored that the terrorists may have been linked to cartel
    crime gangs although we have been told that despite the mass of evidence collected
    at the Society of Conscious Thought School there was nothing to suggest any external
    influences. \n\nInvestigators however remain cagey when asked how the transports
    travel plans were discovered by the terrorists and how the report came to be leaked
    to the GalNet. \n\nA spokesman for CONCORD told us that \"the external threat
    is over, obviously there is some concern over how sensitive documents could have
    leaked, however that will be looked at in due course.\" \n\nIt was later discovered
    that the unknown spokesman was apparently from the office of Tara Rushi, the head
    of Internal Security for the Inner Circle. This would indicate the the internal
    breech was much more serious than had previously been belived. \n\nNo one was
    available for further comment."
