    Lonetrek** \\- In the evening of 112.05.13, a Sansha's Nation raiding fleet attacked
    Umokka II and VIII simultaneously. During the raid, which lasted no more than
    thirty minutes, an estimated 50,000 citizens were abducted from planet VIII, while
    the Sansha claimed that Ummoka II was \"completely harvested,\" and some 100,000
    people have been reported missing.  \n  \n[![Sansha Vessel Orbiting Umokka VIII](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3885/sanshavesselthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3885/sanshavessel.png)According
    to Yoshitaka Moromuo, who was leading Ishuk-Raata Enforcement Division's response
    fleet, the Nation vessels entered Umokka through a wormhole that opened in close
    proximity to Umokka VIII. After few minutes hostile battleships were also reported
    orbiting Umokka II.   \n  \nCapsuleer defence forces made it to the scene fairly
    swiftly and were called to the defence of planet VIII by Sutola Endoma of CONCORD,
    while Koja Tsutariba of the Caldari Navy worked with forces defending planet II.
    \  \n  \nAfter defenders moved to reinforce Umokka VIII, an unknown vessel ambushed
    Koja Tsutariba and outgoing transmissions from his vessel were jammed. The remnants
    of the so-called \"Harvest Fleet\" were reinforced by further Nation battleships
    and an Archon-class carrier. Yoshitaka Moromuo said \"How they managed to enter
    high-security space with it is beyond me.\"   \n  \nWhile numerous pilots present
    at the fray confirmed that they had both seen and fired upon Sansha vessels, CONCORD
    official Sutoma Endoma (speaking in apparent defiance of a CONCORD media blackout)
    dismissed the event as just a capsuleer engagement and declined to confirm any
    reports of abductions from Umokka. \"Reports of landing parties and the abduction
    of citizens cannot be confirmed at this time.\"\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by
