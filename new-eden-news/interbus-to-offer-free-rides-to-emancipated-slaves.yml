    who can trace their lineage back at least 9 generations will be freed from servitude,
    Interbus has announced that it will provide free passage to anywhere in the cluster
    to any recently freed slave for the entire month of January.   \n  \n\"We understand
    that many of these freed slaves will lack the means to leave the Empire,\" said
    Interbus CEO Haukkakka Pukara. \"Some of them will undoubtedly want to go elsewhere.
    But without money, most will be unable to aquire transportation. Interbus was
    founded on the premise of unrestricted movement between all the Empires. We feel
    it is only just to offer our services to these people without charge.\"  \n  \nAny
    freed slaves with proper identification will be allowed free passage. In order
    to claim the free passage, they need only travel to their local Interbus terminal.
    Interbus has stated that a freed slave may travel as many times as he or she likes
    during the month. The company has already begun a massive campaign to inform recently
    freed slaves of the offer.   \n  \nAnalysts expect the offer will cost Interbus
    between 3 and 6 billion ISK during January, depending on the number of slaves
    who take up the offer. According to Interbus's most recently released earnings
    reports, this amounts to less than 1% of their expected profits during this period."
