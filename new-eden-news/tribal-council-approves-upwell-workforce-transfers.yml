    Tribal Council Approves Upwell Workforce Transfers\n\nHeimatar, Pator - The Tribal
    Council has ruled that Upwell workforce transfers will be permitted within the
    Minmatar Republic. The transfers will enable individuals to transfer their consciousness
    to new Upwell workforce clone bodies. The ruling followed an extended Tribal Council
    assembly for which the seven Tribal Chiefs were sequestered for weeks. \n\nSanmatar
    Maleatu Shakor delivered the ruling to a public assembly in the Great Caravanserai
    on Matar, \u201CThe Council has agreed that the life of every Minmatar citizen
    is their own to do with as they choose\u201D he explained. \u201CThe freedom of
    Republic citizens to become capsuleers has long been upheld. Though joining an
    Upwell workforce will mean very different conditions, the choice remains the same.\u201D
    \n\n\u201CI urge any considering Upwell\u2019s offer to think carefully about
    whether it is truly the right path for them, but we will not bar them from walking
    that path as free Matari. For those who would accept the transfers, I will assure
    you that no matter the body you wear, you will remain with us as fellow children
    of Matar.\u201D \n\nThe speech was received with applause by some, and disbelief
    by others. Sebiestor Tribal Chief Acassa Midular praised the ruling as he exited
    the assembly, calling it \u201Can open door to innovation\u201D. Meanwhile, the
    decision was criticized by the Brutor Tribal Chief Wkumi Pol who told the press,
    \u201CToday we owe the citizens of this great Republic an apology, for we have
    failed in our duty to protect them from the ravages of predatory greed.\u201D\n\nThe
    Upwell Consortium celebrated the Tribal Council\u2019s decision, as the Minmatar
    Republic became the first nation to ratify Upwell workforce transfers. Recently
    leaked documents have revealed that Upwell has been lobbying influential political
    figures across New Eden. The Tribal Council was quick to dismiss any implications
    of coercion, however, and even Tribal Chief Wkumi Pol described the suggestion
    as \u201Cwild rumors. We are responsible for our own folly.\u201D\n\nWith the
    Republic\u2019s announcement, pressure is mounting for the Caldari, Gallente,
    and Amarr to make rulings of their own. What those will be, only time will tell.\n\n###
