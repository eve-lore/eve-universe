- body: "VARD - Investigators at the Vard III - Six Kin Development Production Plant
    have discovered one of the deceased individuals found in this station's leg space
    more than a week ago was a capsuleer.\n\n \n\nA report released by the coroner's
    office indicates the deceased persons are a mix of empire races, though most are
    Minmatar in heritage, and lists the cause of death as 'unknown' with specific
    indications of 'fedo attack', meaning some individuals may not have been entirely
    deceased when the animals began eating them.\n\n \n\nCONCORD has not yet released
    the identity of the capsuleer, citing a need for further independent investigation
    by the DED. The coroner's report noted the pilot's spinal sockets appear to have
    been tampered with but draws no conclusions as to the reason.\n\n \n\nDNA samples
    taken from the bodies have yielded very few results. \"Of those individuals we
    have identified, none seem to be linked,\" noted a statement released by station
    security. \"We hope the pilot's name will allow our people to uncover additional
    information and will continue to investigate. However, at this time there is no
    evidence to explain why these particular individuals gathered together here.\"\n\n
    \n\nLikewise, there seems to be no evidence to explain the presence of the capsuleer.
    DED agents have dismissed the possibility that the pilot was trying to hide from
    an enemy, as capsuleers rarely 'run to ground', preferring instead to remain within
    the safety net provided by their capsule's cloning technology. Instead, the DED
    is now entertaining unusual possibilities such as abduction, which may explain
    why the pilot's sockets were tampered with, or an obscure tribal cleansing ritual
    gone bad, as the coroner noted most of the corpses appeared to be malnourished
    despite ample food supplies found with them. Another source has suggested the
    capsuleer may have been the leader of some sort of fedo suicide cult.\n\n \n\nThe
    fedos recovered from the station's leg space have been destroyed under concern
    that subsisting solely on human flesh would create a \"blood fever\". The stomach
    contents, which in fedos can remain undigested for extended periods of time, are
    still being analyzed for remains of additional individuals previously eaten."
