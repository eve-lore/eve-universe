    Three inmates escaped from a maximum security facility in Metropolis last night,
    following an attack by several unidentified craft on the space-bound prison. Violent
    riots erupted as several security systems failed, and parts of the facility remained
    unregulated for hours before security could be restored.\n\nOne of the escaped
    inmates is  Baliggan Krullefor former head of the Krullefor family, a notorious
    Thukker criminal organization. The Republic Justice Department stated that the
    identity of the other two inmates is still unknown at this time, and that they
    are also of Thukker origin. The small force that attacked the facility was not
    identified.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Republic Justice Department,
    the prisoners escaped during a routine transfer between two areas of the facility.
    A number of small vessels were able to bypass the local security systems and attack
    the transfer shuttle. Coinciding with the attack, riots erupted throughout the
    facility, causing the death of 11 guards and as many as 32 prisoners.\n\n \"The
    past months have seen a great increase in arrests made,\" says Justice Department
    representative Achimand Skulada, \"Unfortunately, the prison system is not able
    to keep pace, and that's when we see events like this.\"\n\nSkulada went on to
    ask the public to report any sightings, but to avoid engaging the escapees. \"Krullefor
    will not hesitate to kill anyone who gets in his way.\"\n\nBaliggan Krullefor
    was 19 years into a life sentence. He was found to be guilty of a number of offenses,
    including several counts of murder, piracy, racketeering, and grand theft. At
    the height of its power, the Krullefor Family was the largest unified smuggling
    enterprise between the Great Wildlands and Metropolis. The family's leadership
    was dismantled two decades ago, but the organization is believed to be active
    on multiple fronts."
