- body: "Ebolfer - General Gar Orga announced today that the Tribal Liberation Force
    (TLF) would be entering a team of its most dedicated pilots into the forthcoming
    6th Alliance Tournament. General Orga outlined the arrangements, making clear
    that the organization of the team would rest primarily on the shoulders of the
    top fighters within the TLF.  \n  \n\"After consultation with the Tribal Chiefs
    and authorization from our Commander-in-Chief, the noble Sanmatar Shakor, the
    Supreme Command of the Tribal Liberation Force has decided that three of our pilots
    will be responsible for selecting a team captain,\" announced General Orga. \"These
    three pilots will be those who most distinguish themselves in the ongoing war
    on our borders during the tournament sign-up period. The team captain they select
    will then be responsible for all matters pertaining to the organization and conduct
    of the Tribal Liberation Force team in the tournament.\"  \n  \nQuestioned as
    to the motivation of the TLF entering a team in the Alliance Tournament, General
    Orga replied, \"The traditions of our people include many trials and ritual combats.
    It honors those traditions, and emphasizes the confidence we feel in our brave
    fighters of the Tribal Liberation Force, to enter a team in the tournament. The
    fighters of the Liberation Force are capsuleers who have chosen to honor the cause
    of freedom and the traditions of the Minmatar people. We chose to honor them in
    our turn by making this opportunity to fight for the honor and glory available.
    We are certain that our fighters will meet this challenge with all the skill and
    dedication they have shown in the fight against those who would enslave us.\"\n\nMilitia
    pilots wishing to know more about the selection process should direct their attention
