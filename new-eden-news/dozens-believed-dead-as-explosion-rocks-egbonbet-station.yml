- body: "At approximately 22:50 EVE Time last night, a bomb exploded in the Republic
    Parliament Bureau station in Egbonbet, the station scheduled to host the next
    round of talks between the Minmatar Republic and the Ammatar Mandate. The explosion
    tore into a civilian habitat section of the station and severed several transport
    corridors, catching the Ammatar delegation and killing one of the Mandate consulate
    members.   \n  \nAccording to Republic Security officials, the bomb was a crude
    high-yield device which somehow went undetected by their security sensors until
    the time of activation. While the target seems to have been the Ammatar delegation,
    the bomb is also believed to have caused significant civilian casualties, reportedly
    numbering in the dozens, although the Republic have yet to release any concrete
    numbers. The Republic security on the station were quick to react to the explosion
    and contain its aftermath, saving many lives.   \n  \nEvidence at this time suggests
    that the bombing was executed by the organization known as \u2018The Bloody Hands
    of Matar,\u2019 a terrorist group who have kept a low profile lately but, with
    this act, have propelled themselves back into the media spotlight. In a public
    statement released shortly after the explosion they went on to claim responsibility,
    stating:   \n  \n\u201CWe will not sit idly by while our Republic kowtows to these
    race traitors who sold us out to the Amarr and even now keep our people in bondage.
    How dare we seek terms with these scum? It is a grave dishonour to the sacrifice
    of the great rebellion. Have we learned nothing? What we do, we do for Matar.
    There will be no peace with the Nefantar traitors.\u201D   \n  \nA flurry of activity
    followed in the aftermath of the explosion as the Ammatar quickly evacuated their
    people from the station, retrieving their fallen and racing back to Mandate territory
    under the guard of the Ammatar capsuleer corporation Delictum 23216, who have
    been providing security for Mandate personnel since the talks began. The future
    of the talks is deemed very uncertain at this point. Voices have been heard from
    within Ammatar accusing the Republic of murder and treachery, while the Republic
    has declared its abhorrence of the act, pointing out that many of their own died
    in the explosion and that they will not rest until they have tracked down and
    brought these terrorists to justice.   \n  \nAccording to an anonymous source
    from within the Republic Parliament, diplomatic channels remain \u201Copen but
    extremely fragile.\u201D"
