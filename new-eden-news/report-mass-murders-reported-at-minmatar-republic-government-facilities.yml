- body: "Illuin \u2013 Scope News has just obtained confirmation of the mass-murder
    of hundreds of municipal and regional government officials and throughout the
    Minmatar Republic. The assassins, believed to be aligned with the same Minmatar-Thukker
    strike force invading the Amarr Empire, are allegedly leaving evidence of the
    victim\u2019s complicity with Amarrian intelligence services with each corpse.
    This \"purge\", as the attackers have allegedly described, was clearly timed to
    coincide with the invasion. Police detectives have remarked that the Minmatar-Thukker
    operation was \"flawless\", leaving \"no opportunity for police forces to react.\"
    \n\nThe Republic Fleet still denies any involvement with the attackers, but has
    ordered all combat vessels to amass near the borders as a \"precaution against
    any Amarrian counterstrike.\" \n\n_Posted 14:12 GMT_"
