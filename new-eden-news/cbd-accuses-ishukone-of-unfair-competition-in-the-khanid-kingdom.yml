    The Caldari Business Tribunal is to examine a claim filed by the CBD Corporation
    against Ishukone. According to the plaintiff, Ishukone has \"employed dubious
    tactics\" in the Khanid Kingdom, \"aiming to stifle competition and secure monopoly
    via illegal means.\" Experts say that the accusations in question are serious
    but highly unlikely to be proven true, noting an increase in inter-corporate disputes
    over the past month.\n\nCBD states that Ishukone engaged the services of certain
    mercenary organizations to disrupt CBD's trading routes in the Khanid Kingdom.
    According to the corporation, at least four convoys belonging to its subsidiary
    suffered notable losses when attacked by unidentified hostile ships while en route
    to Kingdom space. Furthermore, CBD claims it has \"concrete evidence linking these
    despicable attacks to Ishukone via third parties.\"\n\nAn Ishukone spokesperson
    dismissed the claims as laughable. \"It's hard to take these allegations seriously.
    We are as eager to expand into this lucrative market as any other corporation
    in the State, but we do not need to resort to such illegal - and frankly mad -
    tactics. Obviously, the CBD Corporation is not feeling confident enough in that
    market if they have to resort to such accusations against us.\"\n\nIndependent
    expert Koro Ihikono commented, \"Collaboration with pirate organizations is a
    serious offense, and Ishukone is facing severe fines if proven guilty, but I doubt
    that CBD will be able to prove anything in court. Interestingly, however, the
    number of conflicts between the megacorps is on the rise again.\"\n\nIndeed, there
    is an ongoing dispute between Lai Dai and Sukuuvestaa over mining rights in the
    Umamon constellation, while Hyasoda is rumored to be preparing a claim to CBT
    over a patent breach by Wiyrkomi. It seems that the recent wave of national unity
    is ebbing away, with the State's largest corporations returning to their usual
    squabbling."
