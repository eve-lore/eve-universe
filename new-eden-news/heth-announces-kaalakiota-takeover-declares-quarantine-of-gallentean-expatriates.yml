- body: "Piak \u2013 Tibus Heth today addressed the Caldari State for the first time
    since the Malkalen disaster, during which he announced his effective takeover
    of operations for the Kaalakiota mega-corporation and declared an immediate quarantine
    of all Gallentean expatriates residing in Caldari space. Set against the backdrop
    of the damaged Ishukone Headquarters Station, his broadcast began with a national
    moment of silence on behalf of \"all those whose lives were taken in Malkalen\"
    and for Otro Gariushi, whom he mourned as a \"true Caldari hero\". \n\nEmphasizing
    his belief that no excuse can relieve the Gallente Federation of direct responsibility
    in the catastrophe, Heth declared that all Gallentean expatriates are to be \u201Cquarantined
    and held for questioning until their innocence is proven\u201D. While not mentioning
    Admiral Noir by name, Heth hinted that if Noir was the most trustworthy man between
    both nations prior to Malkalen, then his \u201Cdeceit\u201D warrants such drastic
    matters as a pure \u201Csecurity precaution\u201D. \n\nA statement issued by the
    Kaalakiota corporation board following the national address confirmed that CEO
    Haatakan Oiritsuu has voluntarily stepped down from her post, giving Tibus Heth
    control over the Caldari State\u2019s largest mega-corporation. These powers authorize
    him to enact the quarantine program, whose methods will likely include deployment
    of his growing numbers of Provists. Because the resignation of Ms. Oiritsuu was
    voluntary, the board of directors has the power to appoint any individual they
    see fit to the position of CEO. \n\nRegardless of shareholder sentiment, public
    support for Tibus Heth is skyrocketing, especially in the wake of days of national
    mourning over Malkalen and the loss of Otro Gariushi. The death toll has risen
    past the 600,000 mark and is still climbing, making this the most grievous tragedy
    of empire space in modern times."
