    for the February 1 death of splinter group leader Karishal Muritor came from the
    top level of Republic government.   \n  \n\u201CThe order for the operation was
    given by Prime Minister Karin Midular\u2019s war cabinet and carried out by an
    Admiral of the Republic Fleet,\u201D said the source at a press conference in
    Renyn yesterday afternoon. \u201CWe had determined through an extensive campaign
    of intelligence-gathering operations ... that Karishal Muritor\u2019s group of
    terrorists were posing a threat to our relations with foreign powers ... [and]
    by association implicating the Republic in military action it has never instigated
    nor condoned. Muritor was a threat to the safety of our Republic, a threat that
    very unfortunately necessitated removal by any means.\u201D   \n  \n\u201CThe
    Admiral was ordered to bring him in, and he persisted in refusing, so things regrettably
    went the way they did,\u201D the source said.   \n  \nMuritor, a highly-decorated
    former Captain of the Republic Fleet and later leader of the rebel splinter group
    the Defiants, was killed after a brief exchange of words with Republic Fleet Admiral
    Kanth Filmir near Planet X in the Auga system.   \n  \nAccording to GALNet reports
    from capsuleer witnesses present at the time of the skirmish, Muritor had agreed
    to a conversation under a banner of truce agreed to between him the Admiral, the
    two reportedly having been old friends. After a brief exchange of words, it became
    clear that Muritor would not cease and desist in his actions against the Amarr
    Empire, and the Admiral deployed a strike force which held and attacked the rebel
    leader.   \n  \nMembers of Matari paramilitary organization the Ushra\u2019Khan
    who were present at the scene at this point opened fire on the Admiral\u2019s
    forces, but were told to cease and desist by both the Admiral and Muritor, who
    himself refused to open fire on Republic Fleet forces. According to reports, his
    last words, before his vessel went up in bright ball of flame, were \u201CDo not
    forget what we achieved with so few. Do not forget.\u201D   \n  \nThe public response
    to Muritor\u2019s death has been one of outrage. Multiple wakes and vigils have
    been held in cities all over the Republic, and dissenter rallies have been held
    calling for Karin Midular\u2019s resignation.   \n  \nThe response within the
    capsuleer community has been even more pronounced. The aforementioned Ushra\u2019Khan,
    a group with long-standing yet historically shaky ties to the Republic, declared
    Prime Minister Midular their \u201Cnumber one enemy,\u201D calling for a 1 ISK
    bounty on her head, the \u201Cvalue representing her worth to the Minmatar people,
    rounded up.\u201D   \n  \nThe Amarr Chamberlain\u2019s Office has yet to comment
    on the matter, but sources from within their administrative wing have reported
    that the Chamberlain is \u201Ceminently satisfied\u201D with the results of the
    Fleet\u2019s operation."
