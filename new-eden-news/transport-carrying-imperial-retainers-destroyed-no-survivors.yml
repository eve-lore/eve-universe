- body: "An Omen-class cruiser carrying personal servants and retinue of the Amarr
    Emperor Doriam II was destroyed under mysterious circumstances while traveling
    in the Throne Worlds constellation. Though the Emperor remained safe and the cruiser
    carried no members of the Imperial family, the Emperor Family Bureau is reporting
    \u201Cover thirty of Doriam II\u2019s loyal and trusted servants\u201D are believed
    to have perished in the event. No harm came to the Emperor, who is preparing for
    his upcoming Empire-wide travels in what the Emperor Family Bureau is calling
    \u201Ca secure location.\u201D \n\nAmong the passengers of the cruiser \u201CRighteous
    Word\u201D were 23 Amarr and eight Ammatar, with an unspecified number of Caldari
    and slave Minmatar. Escort ships reported nothing out of the ordinary until the
    Righteous Word suddenly exploded in a blaze of light and radiation that damaged
    several of its escort craft and left a debris field devoid of any signs of life.
    At the time of the explosion, the transport group had just dropped out of warp-state
    travel and was navigating to a waypoint in preparation for scout craft separation
    and reconnaissance. Reports indicate communication traffic from the pilot of the
    Righteous Word immediately prior to the incident, but the contents or nature of
    the communication remain secret. \n\nThe Righteous Word and five escort and support
    craft were en route to Amarr Prime from an undisclosed location and were believed
    to be making preparations to accompany the Emperor on his projected tour of all
    Amarr-held systems. The servants and associated staff were one of seven such groups
    of servants \u201Cresponsible for the Emperor\u2019s comfort and well-being,\u201D
    and were known to include at least six auxiliary physicians and physician\u2019s
    assistants in their ranks, as well as numerous cooks, grooms, entertainers and
    aides. \n\nSecurity is being increased around both the Emperor and the remaining
    six servant groups while the incident is being investigated."
