- body: "The Gallente Federation Security Council yesterday issued a statement detailing
    a large bounty placed on the head of Henry Foudreal, alleged UDI operative.   \n
    \ \nAccording to the statement, recent investigations have revealed Foudreal to
    have acted as main orchestrator in the UDI's foiled attack on the Gallente Frontier
    Tour Lines resort in Sharuveil three weeks ago. Additionally, the statement details
    a long list of bombings, kidnappings and guerilla strikes he is believed to have
    had a hand in.   \n  \nFoudreal's image has been in circulation on the Federation's
    holovision and advertisement networks since last night. The Federation is promising
    a reward of 30 million ISK to anyone managing to give clues leading to his apprehension.
    \  \n  \nPresident Foiritan, known for populist tendencies and a habit of maintaining
    contact with his people at a grassroots level, has remained out of the public
    eye ever since the Elarel massacre nearly three months ago. At those occasions
    where he has been seen, he has remained laconic and reticent, usually opting to
    bow out early - behavior which, it seems, has become standard protocol for his
    staff.   \n  \nThe President has faced criticism from within senatorial ranks
    these past months, mostly for what senators claim is a \"lack of attention to
    the many and varied problems facing our vast nation\" and \"an inordinate amount
    of focus upon matters of terrorism and the UDI at the expense of other pressing
    social issues such as declining standards of living in the outer systems and increasing
    marginalization of minorities.\"   \n  \n\"It is one thing to seek justice for
    your people,\" stated Senator Aldous Doucet, Chairman of the Federation's Joint
    Committee on Social Affairs. \"To neglect those very people while doing it is
    quite another.\""
