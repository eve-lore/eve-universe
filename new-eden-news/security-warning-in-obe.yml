- body: CONCORD has issued a travel warning to all those going through the Obe system,
    a popular hub and trade route. Apparently a loosely held group of terrorists and
    marauders have been preying on innocent traders. Without mercy, these evildoers
    prefer erasing all traces of their crimes by actually killing their victims. CONCORD
    will not stand idly by, and is now calling for re-inforcements. Until then, strong
    escort is recommended for lone travelers.
