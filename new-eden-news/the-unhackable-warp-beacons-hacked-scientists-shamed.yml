- body: "The deadspace warp beacons, proclaimed as being unhackable by the Caldari
    scientists that built them, have been hacked. Not by any nefarious government
    agency bent on industrial espionage. No, the hacker has turned out to be a 17
    year old Gallentean girl. The story has been well covered by the Scope. The family
    of seventeen year old Ladette Russeot was moving to a new home in the Jeon constellation,
    traveling on a high tech vessel owned by Ladette\u2019s scientist father. Ladette
    missed her favorite soap opera, the Adventures of White Lightning, from her old
    home planet and decided to try and find it amongst the stellar wavelengths en
    route to her new home.   \n  \nLadette possessed just enough technological knowledge
    to be able to put the equipment on her father\u2019s ship to good use, but not
    enough to realize how hopeless her task was. Undeterred, she set out to scan her
    surrounding space lanes and ended up finding the signal used by the empires for
    the deadspace warp beacons, quite by accident. Empire technicians are still trying
    to understand how Ladette managed to do what she did, but to the common man it
    doesn\u2019t matter. All that matters is that what the empires intended to keep
    top secret is now out in the open, accessible to anyone interested in knowing
    how to enter deadspace locations."
