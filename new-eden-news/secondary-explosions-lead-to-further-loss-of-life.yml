    - A series of secondary explosions has rocked the shattered hulk of the Ministry
    of War station in Pashanai. Given the extensive and ongoing rescue and recovery
    operations taking place, this new series of blasts is sure to add to the death
    toll, especially among responders and aid workers.\n\nIt is unclear as yet what
    caused these secondary blasts. While some theorize that they are the result of
    charges placed by the original terrorists with the express purpose of targeting
    first responders, the Bloody Hand of Matar has not yet claimed credit. Further,
    there is some indication that these smaller explosions may be the delayed result
    of damage to the station's power-generation infrastructure.\n\nRescue crews are
    redoubling their efforts to free aid workers who have become trapped.  Ministry
    of War officials have brought in an investigative crew in an attempt to determine
    the cause of the blasts, though serious forensic work may be forced to wait until
    the bulk of critical rescue operations are complete."
