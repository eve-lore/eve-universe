- body: 'NEW CALDARI - The Chief Executive Panel has released a statement calling
    Tibus Heth "the leader of a terrorist insurgency against the Caldari State" and
    has removed him from the role of State Executor. The decision came after a board
    vote of the megacorporation CEOs, with Kaalakiota abstaining as Heth, who legally
    remains Chief Executive, was not present. The seven CEOs unanimously voted against
    Heth.


    Shortly after, the Kaalakiota Corporation board announced that they will be holding
    a shareholder vote in the coming days to decide on a new leadership strategy.
    Exercising their powers under corporate law, the board has declared Tibus Heth
    an outlaw in Kaalakiota territories and vacated the position of CEO. Following
    the shareholder vote, the board will begin the search and selection process of
    appointing a new CEO. The Kaalakiota board of directors have been carrying out
    CEO-level executive functions at the megacorporation since Heth first disappeared
    from public two weeks ago.


    The siege in Haatomo, where Tibus Heth and his insurgents have sealed themselves
    into a Caldari Constructions station, still shows no signs of progress. The Caldari
    Navy has declared it is taking a "wait and see" approach, as it believes thousands
    of Caldari Constructions workers may be held captive by heavily-armed terrorists.'
