    more powerful Holders in conservative areas of the Empire have begun banning the
    use of transcranial microcontrollers by subservient Holders.  \n  \nLord Tapur,
    the Holder of Dakba, stated that the move was a mere formality. \"None of the
    lesser Holders under my charge would think of using them. But a statement needed
    to be made and I have made it. We will not allow change for change's sake to poison
    the moral fiber of the Empire and allow us to drift down a dangerous pathway toward
    corruption. We have already weathered many blows to our traditions and piety in
    recent times. We cannot allow more to assail us.\"  \n  \nExact numbers are not
    available, but nearly 80 percent of the Holders in the Ammatar Mandate and other
    Ardishapur Family domains are estimated to have banned their usage, while high
    numbers have also been reported in the Kador Family's domains. Few Holders outside
    these areas have banned the controllers' use, with almost none being reported
    in the Tash-Murkon Region, where the recent debate first ignited.  \n  \nLord
    Ojir of Sehmy, one of the proponents of transcranial microcontroller use, felt
    the move was emblematic of what he called the \"stodgy conservative element in
    Amarr society.\" According to Lord Ojir, \"The debate isn't about microcontrollers.
    It's about proper morality. We have people who want things to remain the way it
    was when they were born: when the Empire was unchallenged, Heideran VII was Emperor,
    and all was right in the cluster. Those days are past, and to reach them again,
    we cannot continually look back and simper over what once was.\""
