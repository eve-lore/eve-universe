    The Minmatar Republic\u2019s 'Alfhild' Mothership-class vessel that went [ missing](http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=1157&tid=3&sid=1054365940)
    nearly three weeks ago. While initially there was hope that there was no connection
    between the disappearance of the 'Alfhild' and prominent Republic captain Karishal
    Muritor, such hope has proven to be in vain. Captain Muritor confirmed his possession
    of the 'Alfhild' several hours ago. \n\nMuritor made his claim by transmitting
    the following message to The Republic Fleet before disappearing near the Odatrik
    system: \"If you would stand before me and call this state of affairs in which
    we are held right and true, then I am sure that it is better for me and my men
    to fight and die without any right than to live in such a lie.\" Visual data sent
    with the message confirms that the message was sent from the 'Alfhild'. \n\nWith
    no other transmissions received from the captain following his earlier disappearance,
    The Republic Fleet has attempted to distance it self from their former compatriot.
    Pressure from the Amarrian Empire is mounting, according to anonymous sources,
    as Captain Muritor's motives remain unclear. In a statement issued by the Republic
    Fleet an hour after receiveing the broadcast, a fleet representative declared
    Karishal Muritor and all of his followers outlaws. The Republic Fleet also vowed
    to bring Captain Muritor into Republic custody and promptly dispatched a task
    force headed by Vice-Admiral Kanth Filmir. \n\nThe loss of the 'Alfhild' and its
    carrier group consisting of the 'Magni' and 'Modi' along with secondary fleet
    assets is one of the largest thefts of military hardware in recent memory. The
    Republic Fleet confirmed today that they are no longer in possession of the mothership
    and its escorts, and that Captain Muritor is no longer registered as a Republic
    Captain, but rather has formed a dissident group known as \"The Defiants\". \n\nThe
    Republic refused to comment on the intentions of The Defiants or of Karishal Muritor.
    However, experts within The Amarr Navy have speculated that they [The Defiants]
    will attempt to raid and disrupt operations on the border regions of Amarr space.
    Several key Amarrian commanders have also spoken out and have suggested that Muritor
    is still acting on behalf of The Republic Fleet despite the declaration made today
    by The Republic. The Republic continues to deny all allegations of associating
    with the rebellious Karishal Muritor."
