- body: '4C-B7X - The Upwell Consortium has confirmed delivery of gifts to Capsuleers
    across the cluster today, as organizations throughout New Eden begin celebration
    of "Capsuleer Day" on the thirteenth anniversary of the issue of the first commercial
    capsuleer pilot licenses.


    Upwell formally announced yesterday that all capsuleers would receive an Upwell
    themed SKIN for their capsule, as well as festival launchers and pyrotechnics,
    all of which have now been delivered in one of the largest logistical operations
    undertaken by the Consortium this year.


    While the Upwell Consortium remains under fire from critics surrounding alleged
    misrepresentation of its product lineup and its decision to forego warnings regarding
    the dangers of colonizing unregulated space, celebrations have already begun across
    the cluster as capsuleer pilots take to the space lanes with vessels loaded with
    celebratory pyrotechnics.'
