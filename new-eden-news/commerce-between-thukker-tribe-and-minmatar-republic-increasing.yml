- body: 'Rens, Heimatar - In the month since the historic open borders agreement between
    the Minmatar Republic and the Thukker Tribe, the volume of trade between the two
    has increased substantially and continues to rise. Established trade routes between
    the Republic regions and Thukker holdings in the Great Wildlands have seen a ten-fold
    increase in activity, while entirely new routes have been forged between the regions
    by enterprising merchants.


    ''Trade opportunities have multiplied almost daily since the announcement,'' said
    the head of the Minmatar Independent Traders Guild, Ursak Deboul, reflecting optimism
    among the members of his organisation. ''Many of our members have traded on the
    margins of our space and, in all honesty, with more than one Thukker caravan under
    condition of secrecy. Now that the trade is open and routes are becoming well
    used, it puts everything on a much more secure basis. I think this is why we''re
    not yet seeing trade volume plateau. This is only the beginning and it can only
    be good for all the tribes of Minmatar.''


    There is some concern among shippers at signs of increasing pirate activity in
    some areas but Thukker Tribe representatives have been quick to reassure Minmatar
    traders that patrols in the Great Wildlands have been stepped up, particularly
    along the backbone trade routes.'
