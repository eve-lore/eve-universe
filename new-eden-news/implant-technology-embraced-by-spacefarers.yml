- body: "It's all the rage - do commission work for one of the big corporations or
    factions, and they might just award you with the cutting-edge technology implants
    you've been hearing people brag about.   \n  \nAlthough not available on the market
    yet, these cybernetic add-ons have sparked such a huge interest amongst ship captains
    that agents of the corporations in possession of this technology have found more
    willing workers than ever. Captains are always after that little edge, it seems.
    After all, it does not do to be second best when it comes to survival in the more
    dangerous regions of space. The agents know this well, and reserve these special
    awards for their very best contractors.   \n  \nSo far, the implants are simple
    yet effective. As every captain is already outfitted with neural interfaces, it
    takes only a small amount of extra training for them to be able to use the cyberware.
    \  \n  \nPlanet dwellers have been slower on the uptake, however, many fearing
    adverse effects of using too many implants - possibly even a condition similar
    to the \"mind-lock\" that some individuals experience when they are first linked
    to their pod.   \n  \nSome smaller religious groups (generally called 'cults'
    in the mainstream media) are already denouncing the use of implants as \"impurities\",
    but no official statements from the big religions has yet been issued."
