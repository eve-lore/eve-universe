    Security Failures; Protests at Security Council and FIO Measures Grow**\n\nVillore,
    Essence  - A number of Federal Senators have privately called on President Jacus
    Roden to establish a commission of investigation into the security failures leading
    up to the election terror attacks, the Scope has learned. Protests are also growing
    over the continuing imposition of certain restrictions on freedoms during the
    ongoing Federal State of Emergency.\n\nWhile President Roden has so far publicly
    resisted the immediate establishment of a commission of investigation, the Scope's
    sources have suggested he has indicated sympathy for the idea in private discussions
    with a group of senior Federal Senators. The Federal Security Council and the
    Federal Intelligence Office have both advised that a commission should only convene
    once the evidence-gathering phase being overseen by the FSC and FIO has concluded.\n\nPublic
    scorn and outright opposition to the FIO's enhance powers of investigation, seizure
    and arrest are growing daily, however, and the Federal Security Council, more
    respected and trusted by most citizens than the FIO, is now attracting ever more
    strident protests. The Scope joins the calls of concerned Federation citizens
    and experienced Federal Senators for a swift start to an independent investigation
    into the outrages perpetrated during the election attacks.\n\n**Minmatar Tribal
    Liberation Force Retake Floseswin System Control in Counter-Offensive Against
    Amarr Militia**\n\nFloseswin, Metropolis  - Militia fighters of the Tribal Liberation
    Force have successfully seized control of the Floseswin system following a days-long
    counter-offensive aimed at reversing the successes of the 24th Imperial Crusade
    and squeezing off the pipeline of reinforcements and supplies to Amarr forces
    on the planet of Floseswin IV.\n\nValklear General Kanth Filmir hailed the recapture
    of the system as \"a victory for the annals of the Minmatar people.\" The Republic
    Command's Southern Army Group on Floseswin IV has begun sustained bombardments
    of Amarr orbital defense positions and reports of guerilla operations behind occupation
    lines have reached the Scope.\n\nFor their part, House Sarum and its allied forces
    have satisfied themselves with retreating behind the newly-extended field fortifications
    and shield-generators now covering all occupied cities and major towns in Southern
    Floseswin IV. The Scope understands that Minmatar intelligence believes the largest
    cities have been garrisoned with the \"most fanatical\" Amarr forces newly-arrived
    on the planet.\n\nThe presence of a large number of antimatter reactors sited
    so as to power the shielded defenses of the Amarr remains a matter of concern
    for CONCORD conflict monitors. Additionally, an unknown number of _Imud Okyanau_
    -class Strategic Stealth Submarines armed with hypersonic antimatter missiles
    remain hidden in the oceans of Floseswin IV.\n\n**In Other News**\n\n  * Triglavian
