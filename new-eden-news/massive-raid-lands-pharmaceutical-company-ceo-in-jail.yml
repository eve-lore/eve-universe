    HARNER - A cross-agency Gallente law enforcement task force conducted an early-morning
    raid on a small, unlicensed and unregistered pharmaceutical company following
    a week-long sting operation. Acting on information received from an informant,
    agents posed as mining colony directors attempting to purchase the so-called ''Liberty''
    pill.


    Once put in touch with company head Pierre Allendreau, authorities quickly moved
    to shut down the manufacturer. On-site they found over five million ''Liberty''
    pills, after which they swiftly arrested Allendreau, charging him with over 50
    infractions. Six other employees were arrested and then released without charges.
    Officials say they have not ruled out the possibility of criminal charges being
    laid on employees and middle men, as well as prospective buyers.'
