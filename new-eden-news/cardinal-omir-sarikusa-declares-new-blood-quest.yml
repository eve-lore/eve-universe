- body: "A chilling holoreel of Omir Sarikusa, self-declared Blood Cardinal and leader
    of the Sani Sabik sect, more commonly known as the Blood Raider Covenant, was
    discovered yesterday during a DED attack on an undisclosed Blood Raider facility.
    Much of the holoreel depicts the gruesome blood rituals of the sect and has been
    deemed too explicit to publish, except for one segment in which the blood-drenched
    Sarikusa charges his followers with a new command: \n\n\"Go forth, my children,
    and bring to me the blood of the fallen Misu Baniya! Through the blood of both
    the more-than-human and the less-than-human shall the gate to life everlasting
    be opened. Let none stand before you in this holy blood-quest!\" \n\nIn the wake
    of this discovery, CONCORD has issued a traveller's warning for the Bleak Lands
    region."
