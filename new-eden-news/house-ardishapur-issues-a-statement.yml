- body: "**The following announcement** was delivered to Concord news services earlier
    this morning from representatives of house Ardishapur: \n\n_Amarr loyalists! Can
    you not see that your empire needs you? The last few months have caused us great
    distress - the soulless jovians return to our lands with their diseased cadavors,
    minmatar slaves harass our loyal citizens, and now, to our utter disgrace, pirates
    blockade our systems. If it were not for brave and loyal Amarrians such as PIE,
    the pirates would still be there, undisputed.\n\nHouse Ardishapur recognizes that
    all these threats - and they are threats, threats to our way of life! - have been
    brought to our doorstep by filthy outsiders. Until such a time that Idonis Ardishapur
    holds the throne, the navy will not act. Therefore, we call on you, the citizens
    to take what action you are legally allowed to keep Amarr pure and unsoiled. \n\nAll
    true Amarrians must stand together in these trying times._\n\nPolitical experts
    disagree on the exact interpretation of the statment, but it is clear that Ardishapur
    wishes to remind the people of Amarr where his loyalties lie now that the championships
    draw close."
