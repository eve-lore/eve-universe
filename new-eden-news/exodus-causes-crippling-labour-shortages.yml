- body: "Further repercussions from an increasingly large Matari exodus to the Gallente
    Federation surfaced this week as a number of Matari industrial complexes, situated
    near the Republic-Federation border, ground to a halt due to severe labour shortages.
    \n\nWith all eyes on the Gallente Federation as it continues to grapple with the
    sudden influx of Matari immigrants, little heed has been paid to the increasing
    problems caused within the Minmatar Republic by the wholesale loss of citizens.
    In both the Eugidi and Barvigrard constellations, which border the Federation-controlled
    Sinq Laison region of space, the emigration has grown so large that several major
    industrial stations have been forced to cease or severely limit operations due
    to a massive shortfall in the available workforce. \n\nThe Minmatar Mining Corporation
    (MMC) has been hit especially hard by this exodus, being forced to cease operations
    in both mining facilities in the Uttindar system. \n\nSpeaking from a refinery
    station in Aset, MMC mining coordinator Marerlur Simnika in a statement yesterday
    said: \u201CWe've had to strip all of our mineral reserve stations in both constellations
    of all but skeleton crews just to maintain operations both here and at the mining
    outpost in the Avenod system. Even the refinery in Uisper has had to scale back
    operations, partly because of the reduced mineral inputs, but mostly because three
    quarters of the usual staff vanished into the Federation over the last two months.
    The only plus is that there have been no reported incidents of violent tribal
    disputes at any of our facilities\u201D.\n\nFellow Matari corporation Boundless
    Creation has also come under pressure, with several of its facilities in both
    Eugidi and Barvigrard \u2013 most notably in the Hagilur system \u2013 now operating
    at critical staffing levels. \u201CPerhaps we have been more able to hold onto
    skilled workers due to our above average wages and excellent employee benefits,\u201D
    said the Boundless Creation Public Relations Officer, Sirfortur Ofarter, \u201Cbut
    if the current bleed of citizens across the border continues then even we will
    be forced to close down several production lines. The Republic Parliament needs
    to step in and find a solution to this problem before it gets further out of hand.\u201D
    \n\nWith the Parliament and tribal leaders preoccupied over the growing inter-tribal
    violence afflicting the core systems of the Republic, the stream of Matari citizens
    crossing into the Federation is continuing unabated. Several corporations are
    hoping that the Republic will take steps to end the exodus."
