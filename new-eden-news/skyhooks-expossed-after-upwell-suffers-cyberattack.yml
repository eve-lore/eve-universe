    Upwell Consortium Suffers Cyberattack\n\nThe Upwell Consortium has reported compromises
    to the security of Equinox infrastructure following an extensive cyberattack on
    Tuesday. \n\nAccording to an official statement issued by the Consortium, a self-replicating
    worm virus was uploaded into the remote network that connects their Equinox suite.
    Since infiltrating the system, the virus has spread rapidly, infecting 100% of
    Skyhooks and Metenox drills. \n\nThe virus targets the positioning systems of
    infected structures and shares the location of Metenox drills and Skyhooks that
    are vulnerable to attack. The virus makes use of an evolutionary algorithm that
    allows it to adapt to changing security protocols. This advanced adaptability
    of the virus has prevented Upwell from removing it or reversing its effects.\n\nPirate
    groups have been quick to respond to this new information. New Guristas and Angels
    recruitment efforts have been established in the Fulcrum, Zarzakh. This has lead
    to speculation that the Deathless Circle was aware of the cyberattack prior to
    its commencement. The DED, which has been working with Upwell to identify the
    perpetrators of the attack, would neither confirm nor deny these rumors. \u201CThe
    investigation is ongoing,\u201D according to an official statement, \u201Cand
    all possibilities are being considered. We have no doubt that we will be able
    to identify the source of this attack and bring them to justice.\u201D Upwell
    has denied rumors that they are also contracting Mordu\u2019s Legion forces to
    extend the investigations beyond the legal limits that constrain the DED.\n\n###
    Drifter Wormhole Occupiers Clash Over Mounting Controversies.\n\nResearch into
    the mysterious structures inside the captured Drifter wormhole systems continues
    as the controversial proposals of the Drifter Summit divide the leadership of
    the occupying factions. The Caldari and Amarr have led calls for a closed research
    policy within the occupying factions, while the Minmatar Republic and EDENCOM
    leadership have been hesitant to reject the Summit's recommendation for a more
    open research policy.\n\nThe Triglavians Collective has not been invited to join
    in the debate, but is believed to prefer a policy of \u201Cproving\u201D, in which
    the information can only be shared with those who are found to be worthy. \n\nDespite
    these divisions, each faction has continued to invest greater individual efforts
    into Drifter research. Scientific delegations have been recorded visiting from
    the Minmatar, Caldari, and Amarr. EDENCOM, which does not have an established
    research wing, has begun recruiting for an expansive Research and Development
    program. EDENCOM has also begun talks with Upwell, the designers of EDENCOM\u2019s
    vessels, related to the development of a new research department. These talks
    were, however, waylaid due to the recent cyberattack on Consortium infrastructure.\n\n###
    News in Brief\n\n- Early findings from Federation inquest into Race for Hives
    failures implicate Aguard administration.\n\n- Caldari supply EDENCOM forces with
