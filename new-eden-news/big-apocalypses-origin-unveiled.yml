- body: "Speculation has run rampant these past few weeks as to the origin of the
    Imperial Apocalypse-class battleship given away by the BIG Corporation in their
    bi-weekly lottery drawing yesterday. Today, for the first time, reliable information
    on the matter has finally come to light.   \n  \nAccording to sources inside House
    Kor-Azor, the vessel was originally owned by none other than Imperial Heir and
    renowned bad boy Articio Kor-Azor. Apparently, Kor-Azor, who has been involved
    with more than one Gallentean reel starlet through the years, had left the ship
    at Gloria Monterneux\u2019s estate after a wild night of revelry back in February,
    neglecting to return to claim it. Monterneux\u2019s sister, Martina, herself reportedly
    a former lover of Articio\u2019s, instead of handing the ship back to Kor-Azor
    himself then gave it to the BIG Lottery. As to the actress's motivation for doing
    so, she has up until now flatly refused all interview requests.   \n  \nAt time
    of going to press, the Apocalypse has been delivered to its winner, who reportedly
    is of Amarr origin. The BIG Corporation would not divulge the winner\u2019s name
    to the press, in order to preserve the arguably fortunate party\u2019s name from
    mercenary elements seeking the ship\u2019s destruction or retrieval.   \n  \nOfficials
    from House Kor-Azor would not comment on this news, stating only that the ship
    would be reacquired by the Empire \u201Cthrough any means possible.\u201D"
