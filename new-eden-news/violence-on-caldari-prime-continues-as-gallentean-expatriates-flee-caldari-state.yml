    Caldari Prime since Tibus Heth\u2019s mandate to quarantine Gallentean expatriates
    in Caldari Space, which has led to the unlawful incarceration and/or expulsion
    of hundreds of thousands thus far. The mandate is being enforced with renewed
    vigor following Heth\u2019s acquisition of the bulk of the Caldari State\u2019s
    industrial base. Clashes between the two ethnicities on Caldari Prime have been
    ongoing ever since, and Federation riot police are struggling to contain the violence.
    \n\nGallentean expatriates attempting to leave the State have been ordered to
    leave \"donations\" at border crossings before facing permanent exile. \"We don\u2019t
    have anything left,\" reported one former expatriate, now safely within Federation
    space. \"Those Provist thugs boarded the transport and made us sign it all away,
    right in front of our own families. Caldari Navy ships were right alongside of
    us, supervising the whole thing. What could we do?\" \n\nMillions of Federation
    expats remain unaccounted for as tension between the two nation-states worsens
    by the day. While obtaining information from the Caldari State has become increasingly
    difficult since Tibus Heth\u2019s rise to power, reports are circulating that
    drastic increases in production outputs across all industries have been underway
    since the Malkalen disaster."
