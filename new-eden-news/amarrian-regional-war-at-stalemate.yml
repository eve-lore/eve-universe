- body: "KOR-AZOR \u2013 A war that began two months ago because of a perceived insult
    to an Amarrian Holders daughter has ground to a stalemate in the Kor-Azor Region.
    House Darabi, lead by Iraj Darabi, declared war on House Miyan after Touraj Miyan
    refused to apologize for unflattering remarks he made about Darabi\u2019s daughter
    Mina. Although House Miyan\u2019s fleet is nearly twice the size of House Darabi\u2019s,
    creative tactics by Darabi fleet commanders have made both sides somewhat evenly
    matched and the war looks to drag on for quite some time. The other House Lords
    in the region have remained neutral in the conflict. \n\nTouraj Miyan became the
    Holder of House Miyan after the death of his father Idrees six months ago. From
    the outset he made many mistakes in Amarrian social protocol that annoyed the
    Lords of the other regional Houses, but his behavior was tolerated because House
    Miyan is one of the larger and more influential houses in the region. \n\nThree
    months after Touraj\u2019s rise to House Holder, Lord Darabi sent his daughter
    Mina on a mission of diplomacy to House Miyan. When asked the reason for the mission
    Iraj said, \u201CI simply wanted to make sure House Miyan knew that House Darabi
    would still support it in the future. I was shocked and disgusted by what ended
    up happening.\u201D Mina Darabi is well known by the Lords and Ladies of the Kor-Azor
    region for her quick-wit and charm as well as her striking beauty. \n\nApparently
    Lord Miyan was quite taken with the young woman and tried to win her favour. While
    Mina turned down the new Holder\u2019s advances on several occasions she was still
    invited to a lavish feast that Touraj hosted a month after her arrival. Although
    accounts vary, several in attendance said that Touraj became very drunk and threw
    himself at the lovely diplomat. When she rebuffed him once again, Touraj flew
    into a rage and to the shock of others at the party, he loudly questioned not
    only Mina\u2019s upbringing but her chastity and piety. Mina left Touraj\u2019s
    estate that night. \n\nWhen news of the outburst reached House Darabi, Iraj demanded
    a formal apology from Touraj for insulting his daughter\u2019s purity. Touraj
    in turn blamed Mina for the incident saying, \u201CShe was coming on to me, not
    the other way around! Her father [is] just using this as a way to steal everything
    my ancestors have built up\u201D and refused to apologize. At that point House
    Darabi declared war on House Miyan. \n\nIn the two months since the declaration
    many battles have been fought in Kor-Azor and though the Miyan fleet wins the
    majority of engagements they suffer a disproportional number of ship losses. Their
    resources are starting to dwindle at the expense of fielding a fleet nearly twice
    the size of Darabi\u2019s. \n\nBoth sides are looking for a way to break the stalemate
    and the knowledge that capsuleer corporations could provide ships, intelligence
    and resources might weigh heavily on the future war plans of both Houses. \n\nThe
    other Lords in the region have not yet taken sides but there are unsubstantiated
    rumours that behind the scenes many support Lord Darabi. If this turns out to
    be true it could spell the beginning of the end for House Miyan."
