    Megacorporations Recall Extraterritorial Workers as New Rationing Comes Into Effect\n\nNew
    Caldari Prime \u2013 Following an agreement reached at yesterday\u2019s meeting
    of the Chief Executive Panel (CEP), the \u201CBig Eight\u201D megacorporations
    of the Caldari State have all ordered a widescale repatriation of workers. Sent
    to extraterritorial stations and planetary habitats earlier today, the orders
    called for the reassignment to home territories of a significant number of non-essential
    workers with Caldari citizenship.\n\nThis mass worker recall coincides with the
    signing of a ration-ceiling agreement by all eight members of the CEP. This agreement
    introduces maximum limits on the purchasing of a wide variety of goods, both essentials
    and luxury commodities. These limits have been defined relative to an employee's
    corporate classification. The new limits will be enforced by standard corporate
    oversight of personal corporate scrip accounts, with all transactions being monitored
    and blocked should they exceed the ration-ceilings.\n\nThe combination of a mass
    labor repatriation with the expansion of rationing has many questioning the state
    of the Caldari economy. The Caldari State has long boasted one of New Eden\u2019s
    strongest economies but was hit hardest by the Triglavian Invasions. Market analysts
    suspicious of these recent changes have been quick to point out that the State\u2019s
    economy has generally been heavily reliant on foreign trade, with a higher proportion
    of trade being conducted outside its borders than by any other interstellar nation.
    Some theorize that the State may be starting to feel an economic pinch due to
    the heightened conflict with the Gallente Federation, rising tensions with the
    Amarr Empire, and relatively low trade activity from recently opened Minmatar
    markets.\n\nChairman Akimaka Saraki dismissed these fears at a press summit on
    New Caldari Prime, stating that: \u201CThe Caldari State is stronger now than
    it has ever been. As first in the cluster to finalize the construction of an Interstellar
    Shipcaster we have shown ourselves to be the masters of cutting-edge stellar transmuter
    and transport relay technology. These new measures have been implemented because
    we Caldari will do whatever it takes to ensure victory and prosperity. We call
    our citizens home so they might join us in the fight and strengthen the State.
    We bear the burden of rationing because we do not fear sacrifice. Let the people
    of the Federation grow complacent and fat, we shall see who endures the trials
    to come.\u201D\n\nDespite Chairman Saraki\u2019s strong words there are growing
    rumors of unrest amongst lower-level workers. The classification banding included
    in the ration-ceiling agreement means that such citizens are under the tightest
    of the new restrictions. Many repatriated workers are leaving behind their families
    only to suffer greater State restrictions. Lower-classification citizens are also
    more likely to be reassigned to security services or conscripted into the State
    military. Clearly aware of such concerns, the CEP Chairman tackled them head on,
    saying, \u201CAll Caldari understand the values of Honor, Loyalty, and Duty. Only
    shirkers and traitors would refuse to do their part when called to service.\u201D\n\n![Inner

    *Above: CONCORD Inner Circle Station, Yulai system*\n\n### CONCORD Inner Circle
    Weighs Changes to New Eden Economic System as State Announces New Measures\n\nYulai,
    Genesis \u2013 Ongoing negotiations on interstellar economic, technology, and
    infrastructure regulations within CONCORD's Inner Circle have been dramatically
    shaken up by the Caldari State's announcement of new domestic rationing, financial
    monitoring, and worker repatriation measures.\n\nWhile the State has been strongly
    arguing for further liberalization of interstellar trade and significant changes
    to empire taxation and SCC regulatory overheads, the recall of large numbers of
    employees, together with increased megacorporation controls and monitoring of
    consumption and expenditures has caused some disquiet among other delegates of
    the \"Big 4\" empires.\n\nThe Gallente Federation in particular has indicated
    its concern that the moves are a prelude to a more protectionist stance by the
    State, despite its pursuit of open markets for its own goods and services, or
    an attempt to unbalance the financial system by directing capital flows and investment
    disproportionately towards Caldari internal markets and industries. The Caldari
    State's negotiators have dismissed these fears as \"misplaced attempts to reopen
    arguments already settled\" at the summit. \n\nIn contrast, the Amarr Empire has
    seized on the opportunity to improve its strained relations with the State by
    declaring that it views the new Caldari measures as \"matters of internal economic
    organization and social reform\". Despite the end of its formal military alliance
    with the State, the Greater Amarr Empire has maintained considerable trade links
    with Caldari megacorporations, in particular using its Khanid Kingdom and Ammatar
    Mandate vassal states to increase flows of exchange between the two powers.\n\nSo
    far the Minmatar Republic's delegation has preferred to keep its own counsel on
    the Caldari announcement, at least in private, and is concentrating on developing
    its own approach to reforming SCC taxes and overhauling the regulations and fees
    levied on capsuleer structures. Much agreement has been found between the Caldari
    and Minmatar on the topic of the Upwell Consortium's preferential status as a
    provider of industrial services. Both empires view the dominant position of the
    interstellar consortium with deep suspicion since the events of the Triglavian
    Invasions, its role in arming and funding EDENCOM, and the spate of industrial
    espionage scandals in recent years.\n\nWhile the Amarr Empire is noted for having
    an ambiguous relationship with Upwell and EDENCOM, it has found common cause with
    the Gallente Federation's wish to normalize the structure of industrial fees and
    taxes, and it appears likely that some kind of deal on the overall industrial
    support servicing, taxation, and licensing regime  will be forged between the
    Big 4 empires.\n\nNegotiations are ongoing and the precise package of new economic
    and technology regulations to come is expected within the next two weeks.\n\n![calnav
