- body: "Today saw a surprise development in the continuing speculations over CreoDron's
    alleged 'financial black hole' recently unearthed in their public accounts. CreoDron
    today made an unscheduled early loan repayment to the Garoun Investment Bank.
    This was followed by the first public statement made by CreoDron since the beginning
    of the affair. \n\n\"A substantial repayment has been made to our investors at
    the Garoun Investment Bank due to the cancellation of a major R&D; project undertaken
    by this company. The project has regrettably not lived up to expectations and
    failed to yield the anticipated results. Rather than commit the outstanding funding
    to the project the CreoDron board of Directors voted to withdraw funding and reimburse
    our investors to safeguard their money.\" \n\nMany pundits remain unconvinced
    by the explanations provided and continue to speculate on a cover-up and trouble
    brewing at CreoDron. The Garoun Investment Bank has responded to CreoDron demanding
    a full explanation of what has happened to the research project in which their
    shareholders had placed their trust. \n\nInitial public response has been mixed,
    seeing a significant number supporting CreoDron\u2019s move to preserve resources
    and admit to a setback. Yet a similar number are frustrated with recent developments
    in the Federal economy, described as \u2018disappointing\u2019. A popular recording
    of the moment depicts one member of the public expressing her views; \n\n\u201CI
    can\u2019t believe some of the stuff I\u2019ve been hearing, you\u2019d think
    that when our economy has been as strong as it has been lately our companies would
    be spending more wisely. We can\u2019t sit back and pretend it will never end!\u201D"
