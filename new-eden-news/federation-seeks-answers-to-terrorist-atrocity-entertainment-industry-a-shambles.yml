- body: "This morning President Souro Foiritan of the Gallente Federation, in closed
    session with the Federal Security Council, ordered a special investigative task
    force assembled. The task force, which will reportedly consist of the Federation\u2019s
    top law enforcement and intelligence agents, has been given the assigment of tracking
    down and bringing to justice the people behind the UDI (United Against Decadence
    and Impurity), the mysterious splinter faction which has claimed responsibility
    for the attack committed on the Rent-A-Dream Pleasure Gardens complex in Elarel
    yesterday evening.   \n  \nPresident Foiritan had intended to show up at the festivities
    as a surprise guest, but his escorts warped in to find only a gigantic cloud of
    fallout where the station had been. At an impromptu press conference in the minutes
    following his arrival, the obviously shaken president stated that the perpetrators
    of this heinous act would be brought to justice, taking the time to thank the
    pilots assembled in the system for their valiant struggle in fending off the tide
    of aggressors.  \n  \nThe tragedy yesterday claimed the lives of over six hundred
    Gallente entertainment industry giants, among them actors, directors, producers,
    cinematographers and agents. Writes cultural commentator Belle-Marie Jincroix
    in today\u2019s _Federation Tribune_ : \u201CThe effects of yesterday\u2019s horrific
    massacre will make ripples in the entertainment industry unlike anything we\u2019ve
    ever seen. Sure, most of these people have clones, but as we\u2019ve seen time
    and time again people never turn out _exactly_ the same as before, and the slight
    differences a clone transplant can effect have time and time again proven enough
    to break a movie star\u2019s mojo. It will be interesting to see how the Gallente
    entertainment industry recovers from this massive blow.\u201D"
