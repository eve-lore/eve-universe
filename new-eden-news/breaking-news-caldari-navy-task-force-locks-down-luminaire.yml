    capital system of Luminaire has been locked down from the inside by the Caldari
    Navy and an accompanying task force composed of thousands of ships. Witnesses
    describe sighting capital ships representing every mega-corporation and at least

    monitored by Scope News. \n\nUnconfirmed reports have surfaced that anti-ship
    mines have been deployed at all stargate entry points inside Luminaire, and that
    any attempt to run the blockade, no matter how many ships are sacrificed, is effectively
    impossible. \n\n_Posted 14:50 GMT_"
