- body: "The Jovian Directorate yesterday issued a statement claiming its Extra-Racial
    Liaison, Misu Baniya, has undergone molecular reconstruction and is on the road
    to recovery. The statement also affirmed the Directorate's gratitude towards the
    dedicated masses of pilots who coordinated their efforts in order to collect the
    necessary amount of biological material required for the reconstruction.   \n
    \ \nBaniya is expected to begin a diplomatic tour of the galaxy cluster early
    next week. According to the statement, the intention is to visit the four largest
    empires' heads of state, but reportedly most of the liaison's time will be spent
    establishing diplomatic contact with the leaders of various nation-state alliances
    which, over the course of the past year, have cropped up in almost every corner
    of non-CONCORD-policed space but have hitherto been ignored by the four empires
    as political entities.   \n  \n\"If they're trying to make a point, I don't know
    what it is,\" stated a Federation senator who asked to remain anonymous. \"Sure,
    since the ISD came about the eggers have spread all over the place, but putting
    those 'societies' of theirs up there in lawless space on the same pedestal as
    us? If I didn't know better, I'd say the Jovians were deliberately trying to undermine
    the rich history and traditions of our civilizations. In fact, I'm not entirely
    convinced that's not what they're trying to do.\"   \n  \nIndividuals within other
    governmental circles throughout the cluster have expressed similar reactions.
    Caldari officials have declined to comment on the issue altogether, but newsfeeds
    within the Amarr Empire have been rife with political pundits of all stripes spinning
    their heads in confusion.   \n  \n\"We don't know what to say,\" said a senior
    tribal council member within the Minmatar Republic, who also wished to remain
    anonymous. \"We can't begin to fathom their motivations. We're stumped.\""
