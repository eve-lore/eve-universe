- body: "Special Counsel Tar Maurisi, head of the CEP Business Bureau's investigation
    into the Ullia Hnolku disappearance, at a press conference this morning revealed
    some of the latest discoveries made by the investigative committee. Chief among
    these was information brought to light by a report which had found its way from
    an anonymous source in Zainou's main labs.   \n  \nThe report, four pages long,
    begins by detailing progress on a few projects under development at the laboratories,
    after which it delves into the subject of Insorzapine bisulfate and the company's
    attempts to reproduce it. According to Maurisi, at several points the report indicates
    that, in fact, the mutagen binder is \"not as dangerous as the public has been
    led to believe.\"   \n  \nThe Special Counsel went on to reveal excerpts from
    the report:   \n  \np. 2: \" _Half-life testing on Insorzapine-4 has shown that
    two of the compound's breakdown elements, at RTT 1.6 and 1.8, exceed the CPRC's
    0.4% limit. Since the bisulfate variant was lost we have made some steps backward
    in the safety dept, but as of yet protective gear has not been deemed required
    by staff._ \"   \n  \np. 3: \" _... and we feel that in order to reduce toxicity
    to the levels evidenced by preliminary Insorzapine bisulfate tests, a greater
    emphasis needs to be placed on development of non-covalent binding patterns and
    ionic channel receptivity._ \"   \n  \nMaurisi went on to state that \"this apparently
    willful misrepresentation of facts by Zainou will be investigated to the full
    extent possible.\" When asked as to his thoughts on why the biotech giant would
    exaggerate the danger posed by the drug, the Special Counsel replied \"Well, that's
    what we're here to find out, isn't it?\""
