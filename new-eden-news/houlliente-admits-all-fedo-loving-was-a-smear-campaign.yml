- body: "Liberienne Houlliente, society playgirl, has admitted the allegations she
    made against a noteworthy Drone technology academic were completely false.\n\nHoulliente
    had told reporters that Professor Reymonde Foucalt groomed her into a seedy world
    of Fedo inspired role-play, and expected her to dress up in bizarre outfits to
    satisfy his twisted lust. Her smear campaign fell apart when it was revealed that
    she had received large payments from a large Drone manufacturer in order to discredit
    the Professor.\n\nFoucalt has recently been working independently on new drone
    control techniques, and has repeatedly refused to work with any of the corporations
    who have continually tried to purchase his research. It seems that a Gallentean
    drone manufacturer was willing to go further than most corporations to secure
    his work, and when he refused to sell out to them, they embarked on an underhand
    campaign to discredit Foucalt.\n\nMs. Houlliente admits that she was contacted
    by an industry insider shortly after her relationship with Foucalt finished. \u201CThe
    money wasn\u2019t that important to me actually.\u201D She reflects \u201CReymonde
    had hurt me, and I wanted to let him feel some pain as well. I don\u2019t think
    I would have acted on my own, but once the seed was sown, I couldn\u2019t stop
    thinking about hurting him.\u201D\n\nFoucalt was visibly relieved as he made a
    statement at his office in Balle. \u201CI will be pleased to put this whole disturbing
    matter behind me. I am disappointed that Liberienne would go to such extremes
    to try and discredit me, but she is a woman after all, and we all know how women
    can behave when they don\u2019t get their own way. I am looking forward to getting
    my research back on track, and ironically, my forced vacation gave me a chance
    to write up some new ideas that I didn\u2019t have the chance to while I was in
    the laboratory.\"\n\nIndustrial espionage is seen as a natural operating risk
    in the Caldari State, but is usually less visible in the Federation. Industry
    analysts claim that this high profile case is an indication of just how competitive
    the Drone industry has become recently, after reports that the Federation Navy
    are shifting their tactical doctrine in favour of increased drone usage."
