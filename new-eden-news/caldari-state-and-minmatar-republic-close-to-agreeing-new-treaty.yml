    Minmatar Republic Reportedly Close to Agreeing New Treaty\n\nAiraken, The Forge
    \u2013 Caldari State and Minmatar Republic negotiators are reported to be close
    to agreeing a \"new treaty\" as the culmination of a summit that has been billed
    as a Caldari-Minmatar security co-operation meeting. The two powers have sent
    unusually large delegations to the summit meeting at the Hyasyoda station in Airaken,
    including Hyasyoda CEO Ahtonen Osmon and Republic Prime Minister Tobias Efrit.\n\nOutside
    observers had already suggested that the high-powered delegations indicated negotiations
    on a major diplomatic realignment could be in the offing. The new reports from
    Airaken suggest that something akin to a non-aggression treaty is on the cards,
    though it is thought with reservations that reflect the recent history of proxy
    conflicts and alliances with the Amarr Empire and Gallente Federation.\n\nThe
    strong desire for independence and freedom of action that are hallmarks of both
    the State under Chairman Akimaka Saraki and the Chief Executive Panel, and the
    Republic under Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor and the Tribal Council, have reportedly
    made for some difficult negotiations at times. On the point of technology sharing
    both powers are highly guarded and mutually reluctant to use their recent advances
    in Triglavian research as bargaining chips. Rather, the summit has focused on
    securing agreements on borders and recognition of mutual rights and sovereignty
    in accordance with the provisions of the Yulai Accords and Convention.\n\nReactions
    in the Caldari State and Minmatar Republic to the talks have been broadly positive,
    with a general feeling among the public of both empires that there has never been
    any real reason for the Caldari and Minmatar to be at war with one another. Citizens
    strolling through the parklands surrounding Landfall Shrine on New Caldari Prime
    were well represented by a Wiyrkomi Heavy Industries fusion technician who said,
    \"Well, sure, we've always been against slavery here anyway, and it's not like
    the Minmatar ever did us any wrong. I'd rather we sold them guns than have to
    use them against them.\"\n\n\"It's true we had some debts to pay the Gallente
    after the Rebellion but those dues were paid long ago,\" said one Vherokior storekeeper
    in the market quarter of Matar City. A Sebiestor ice-cutter in Mithris was more
    forthcoming: \"I never did like those Feddies anyway, especially after what they
    did to the Ray and that stab in the back at what's it called? Colalele? Whatever,
    the place they ambushed our fleet. Treacherous bastards.\"\n\nLate-breaking reports
    from New Caldari Prime and Pator suggest that each of the State and Republic delegations
    are preparing to travel to the respective home worlds of their counterparts for
    simultaneous final negotiations with the CEP and Tribal Council.\n\n![pashanai

    Amarr Empire and Gallente Federation Diplomats Meet in Pashanai System\n\nPashanai,
    Genesis \u2013 Diplomats from the Amarr Empire and Gallente Federation are meeting
    in the Pashanai system according to reports from the Amarr Certified News agency.
    According to the ACN, Royal Heir Ersilia Kor-Azor is personally playing host to
    Councillor Wayaki Kayara, a veteran Mannar diplomat and personal envoy of President
    Celes Aguard, at the ACN station in orbit of Pashanai III, Moon 9.\n\nThe ACN
    goes on to report that Empress Catiz I personally spoke to President Aguard in
    order to open talks on the \"implications for the Empire and Federation of the
    Minmatar Republic's overtures to the Caldari State.\" The presence of Councillor
    Kayara as leader of the Gallente delegation indicates that President Aguard is
    treating the possibility of a realignment involving the State and Republic sufficiently
    seriously to ensure that Federation's relations with the Amarr Empire are secured.\n\nAnalysts
    of the Amarr Empire's diplomatic and media strategies have suggested that the
    choice to widely publicise the meeting, and indeed host it at an ACN station,
    indicates the Empire believes it is negotiating from a position of some strength.
    The Empire's military has been considerably upgraded and expanded in the years
    since the Triglavian Invasions, with the losses from that conflict made good by
    Empress Catiz I's industrial and military policies, while primarily making use
    of House militaries and capsuleer militias in its border conflict with the Republic.\n\nThe
    Amarr Empire has also stolen a march on Triglavian stellar transmuter technology
    and is believed to have considerably improved its understanding of the technology
    following the Turnur catastrophe. In contrast, the Gallente Federation stands
    denuded of any access to stellar and spacetime manipulation technologies recovered
    by the other empires. The Federation is also considerably extended by its massive
    and ongoing military operation to maintain the security of the Intaki system,
    and the ten other systems in Placid removed from the Caldari-Gallente warzone
    by direct Navy occupation.\n\nThere is considerable speculation in the Gallente
    media that President Aguard's administration may see the putative treaty between
    the Caldari and Minmatar as relieving it from any obligations it has under its
    current militia warfare alliance with the Republic. The Amarr Empire's diplomatic
    signalling so far has also indicated, as one court observer put it, \"a level
    of disinterest in the Caldari-Gallente warzone amounting to imperial indifference.\"\n\nAnother
    analyst of Imperial politics differed with this appraisal, stating that \"the
    Empire's policy regarding the other warzone is rather one of masterly inactivity
    that really signals it sees nothing to protest at concerning the Federation's
    invasion of Intaki and surrounding systems. To the Amarr, the Federation's policy
    is simple good sense, and usefully opens the door to arguments it might deploy
    in the event it uses the full might of the Imperial Navy against some portion
    of the 'Rebel Provinces'.\" This analyst also noted the symbolism of holding the
    meeting in Pashanai close by the Ministry of War station bombed by Minmatar terrorists
    in YC112, and suggested that the Amarr diplomatic campaign was \"a classic Amarr
    of public relations at every level.\"\n\n![imp nvy base mehatoor](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/34kz4ZxXM9gVLQtW6BgbcI/30744869f4d530162ee042ecdba83f96/imp_nvy_base_mehatoor.png)
