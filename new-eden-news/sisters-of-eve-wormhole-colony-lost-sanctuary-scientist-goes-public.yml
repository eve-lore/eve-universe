- body: 'BREAKING NEWS - In a new development that may be related to the superluminal
    anomaly known as "Caroline''s Star", a scientist with the Sisters of EVE research
    organization known as the Sanctuary has claimed that contact with a Sisters of
    EVE colony deep in wormhole space has been lost since the appearance of the mysterious
    anomaly.


    Sister Taya Akira has revealed to the Scope - in what she freely admits is a breach
    of her oath of obedience to the Sisters of EVE - that several years ago the Sanctuary
    established a large multiple station colony in a hitherto unknown star system
    only accessible using wormhole exploration technology developed by the Sisters
    of EVE. Sister Taya has claimed that this system was named "Thera" and she was
    until recently working as a research scientist at a Sanctuary facility in the
    system.


    Sister Taya has further claimed that the appearance of Caroline''s Star coincided
    with a loss of contact between Sanctuary headquarters in X-7OMU and the colony
    in the Thera system. She states that she has decided to break her oath and speak
    out due to a refusal on the part of the SOE leadership to mount a large-scale
    effort to re-establish contact with the colony. Sister Taya believes, for reasons
    she has refused to specify, that the colony may be in great danger and that rescue
    operations are required. Her most urgent appeal is "for capsuleers to co-ordinate
    and co-operate in the search for Thera and our lost colleagues".


    The Scope reached out to the Sisters of EVE and the Sanctuary for comment on this
    story but all regular SOE contacts have declined that offer.'
