    plan to step down from his position to award full control of company assets and
    strategic operations to Caldari Constructions. The move was unanimously approved
    by the Ytiri board of directors. \n\n\"By taking this step, we are embodying the
    ideal that will always be the legacy of Otro Gariushi: that the State\u2019s needs
    are greater than ourselves,\" Mr. Iwisoda stated. \"We are a nation in crisis;
    the acquisition of wealth or political gain no longer has any virtue in this corporation.
    As a Caldarian and a Chief Executive Officer, my actions are a patriotic imperative.
    The atrocity committed by the Federation has demonstrated just how vulnerable
    we are, and the depths to which we have fallen. Mr Heth, the men and women of
    the Ytiri Corporation are at your command.\" \n\nAlthough Ytiri is a comparatively
    small corporation, the willingness of its leadership to relinquish control of
    operations to Mr. Heth appears to be supported by the majority of Caldari citizens.
    Following the press statement, representatives acting under the banner name of
    \"Provists\"\u2014the nickname for Mr. Heth\u2019s new \"Caldari Providence Directorate\"
    structure within the corporation\u2014explained the working relationship between
    the two entities. Financial markets have responded positively to the new partnership
    thus far."
