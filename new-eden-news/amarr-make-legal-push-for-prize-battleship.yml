    Amarr Imperial Chancellor\u2019s office arrived in Algogille yesterday to meet
    with officials from the Federal Administration, apparently in hopes of discussing
    the legal applicability of the will registering an Amarrian battleship to late
    reel star Gloria Monterneux\u2019s estate.   \n  \nThe ship, an Imperial-issue
    Apocalypse, one of the most dangerous war vessels currently in existence, was
    subsequently inherited by Ms. Monterneux\u2019 sister, Martina Monterneux, after
    which the bereaved sibling then donated it to the BIG lottery.   \n  \nSince the
    BIG Corporation announced the giveaway in their newsletter last week, Amarr officials
    have maintained a steady stream of inquiries into the matter, both on the Federation
    front and within the Empire itself. No information as to how the ship came to
    be in the actress\u2019s possession has been made available to the press yet,
    nor have Amarrian officials managed to make much headway in getting the Federation
    to make reparations. \u201CGallente law is Gallente law,\u201D said Egliller Dasbrulier,
    Chief Coordinator of Public Relations for the Federal Administration, \u201Cand
    everything proceeded in accordance with that law. There is no need for us to second-guess
    the law.\u201D   \n  \nResponding to allegations that the Federation\u2019s laissez-faire
    attitude towards Amarr inquiry constitutes a form of political retribution against
    the Empire\u2019s highly-contested extradition of UDI terrorist Goran Mitelek
    last week, Dasbrulier gave a firm denial. The Office of the President was unavailable
    for comment.   \n  \nThe lottery is scheduled to go on as planned, with the drawing
    slated for May 24th."
