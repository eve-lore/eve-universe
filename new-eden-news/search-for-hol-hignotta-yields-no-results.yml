- body: "In a statement earlier this morning, Concord announced that they have called
    off the official search for Hol Hignotta, the pilot responsible for the unprovoked
    and fatal attack on an Opus Luxury Yacht in the Yulai system.   \n  \nThe active
    search period of three weeks has passed and as they have found absolutely no leads
    hinting at his whereabouts, the search has been called off.   \n  \nEven mercenaries
    have been unable to track down the elusive terrorist. The lack of clues pointing
    to his location is breeding an atmosphere of frustration. One enraged pilot called
    him \"a cowardly disgrace, with no honour or dignity, giving a bad name to all
    pilots\".   \n  \nCriminologists speculate that the high profile nature of his
    case could have caused him to go into hiding, fearful that the large press coverage
    will make him easier to track down than he originally thought. With so many people
    on the lookout for Hignotta, it is quite possible that he will remain hidden for
    some time."
