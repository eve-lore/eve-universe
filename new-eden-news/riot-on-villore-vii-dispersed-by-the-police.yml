- body: "Villore - Escalating tensions in the Gallente Federation have led to the
    first confrontation between the anti-Caldari protesters and the riot police outside
    the Caldari diplomatic building on Villore VII.   \n  \nThousands of protesters
    have gathered around the diplomatic mission, shouting anti-Caldari slogans and
    blocking entry to the building. Additional police units had been deployed to the
    area several hours before, but the law enforcement squads had failed to abate
    the conflict as several protesters started hurling stones at the building.   \n
    \ \nFearing that the mob will get out of control, the police employed tear gas
    and sonic grenades against the protesters. No shots were fired, and the riot was
    quickly dispersed.  \n  \nKronal Gattard, Villore police commissioner, had addressed
    the marchers: \"Today is a black day for all of us, but there is absolutely no
    indication that the Caldari State or any of its citizens are to blame. I share
    your grief, but I have to say this to you: my people and I will deal with any
    breach of peace with utmost severity.\""
