- body: "Gallentean Senator Cedriq Tyrion made a fool of himself yesterday, as well
    as making a mockery of the Federal Senate, when he held a speech supposed to be
    on this years budget while being implanted with a mind-altering Transcranial Microcontroller.
    The Senator might have gotten away with this severe breach of etiquette if it
    wasn't for the fact that he was under the illusion that he was a young girl dancing
    barefoot through the meadows on his home planet. Naturally, this affected his
    speech somewhat. It was later revealed that Senator Tyrion, longing to relive
    the easygoing life of his youth and the long lost innocence he had once known,
    had bought a custom made chip that he seemingly forgot to remove before entering
    the Senate session. The scandal has already seen the end of the Senator's political
    career and he might even face criminal prosecution for bringing the Senate into
    disrepute.  \n  \nMany suspect this disgraceful incident will have some ripple
    effect against the now infamous chips, bolstering the strength of those that oppose
    its use. Yet it remains to be seen what avenues, if any, the government will pursuit
    to restrain their use, as censorship is something the Gallenteans are loath to
    employ. In the meantime, the chip rave continues unabated, spurring a debate that
    touches the very core of the Federation; that of personal freedom versus social
    sheltering. No expert knowledge is required to predict that this debate is only
    just beginning."
