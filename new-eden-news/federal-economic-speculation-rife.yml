- body: "LUMINAIRE: Media attention of the Federation financial sector has grown notably
    in recent days as pundits begin to make predictions on the content of a report
    due from the Bank of Luminaire. Speculation has been building in recent months
    on the health of the Federation's economy and just how sustainable its growth
    rate truly is. \n\nIn the past eighteen months the Federation has seen its population
    swell, fuelled by large numbers of Minmatar immigrants settling within its territories.
    This, combined with other factors, has seen the economy undergo a sustained period
    of rapid growth. \n\nAnalysts have in recent months begun to question how long
    such growth will continue and what may happen should the economy begin to slow
    as has been seen over the border in the Caldari State. It is rumoured that the
    Bank of Luminaire has placed special emphasis on answering these concerns to calm
    investorsd and that this quarter's economic report may yield eagerly anticipated
    insights. \n\nPredictions of the report's findings vary wildly ranging from pointers
    towards a looming bust to an escalation of economic growth proportional to further
    Caldari decline. While some pundits insist that a slowing of the economy is inevitable,
    others point to Gallentean market successes in the area of capital ship production.
    The proliferation of Gallente engineered Obelisk freighters plying New Eden's
    shipping lanes is seen by many as an indicator of a robust trading industry. \n\nThe
    economic powerhouses of the Federation are known to be monitoring the Bank of
    Luminaire's findings very closely, as are media pundits across New Eden."
