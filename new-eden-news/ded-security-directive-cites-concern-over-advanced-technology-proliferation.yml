- body: "JERHESH \u2013 A leaked security memo originally circulated internally at
    DED cites increased surveillance efforts on at least two research facilities due
    to intelligence reports that scientists operating there may be on the verge of
    significant technological advancements. The security directive, signed by DED
    Security Commander Haram Goskakar, states that the \u201Cintel indicates with
    high confidence that technological breakthroughs are imminent at the Viziam Factory
    in Baviasi II and the Thukker Mix Factory in Brin V\u201D. Also listed on the
    directive are the names of scientists currently working with the research agents
    Bikan Uanen and Eladizo Ansfriken.   \n  \nThe memo explains that \u201Cwith an
    alarming number of reports emanating from deep-space regions about an unexpectedly
    sharp upgrade in the types of technology available to pirate organizations, the
    focus is to become more proactive in our mission by keeping surveillance on those
    entities responsible for the proliferation of high-tech arms to criminals\u201D.
    Although owners of high tech patents and equipment are under no legal constraints
    regarding the sale of their property, CONCORD certainly has final word over how
    the equipment is used within the borders of Empire space. The Minmatar government,
    while not openly challenging DED in this light, is already rumored to be applying
    any high-tech advancement towards the support of an underground war effort against
    the Amarr Empire.   \n  \nBikan Uanen and Eladizo Ansfriken have both refused
    to comment on either the DED security directive or the status of any projects
    they are currently involved with. The memo suggests that at least three more stations
    have been the sites of heightened electronic \u201Cchatter\u201D consistent with
    signs of pronounced scientific advancements.   \n  \nDED, CONCORD\u2019s law enforcement
    branch, is primarily responsible for the tracking down and apprehension of known
    criminals."
