- body: "Several travelers in the outer regions have recently reported spotting new
    frigates of advanced design in the outer regions, piloted by known brigands. These
    news tie in with earlier reports by DED that pirate factions are receiving substantial
    aid from inside the empires, something that has undoubtedly been going on for
    a considerable time. These new frigates are just the last in what seems to be
    a concentrated effort to bolster the strength of all the major pirate factions.
    \  \n  \nThe impact these new frigates will have is still to be determined but
    travelers in unsafe space are urged to show even more caution than before, as
    more audacious pirate activity is the likely outcome. On the other hand, the increased
    wealth of pirates may be a blessing in disguise for some as the pirates themselves
    are undoubtedly now a more lucrative target for those bold enough to confront
    them."
