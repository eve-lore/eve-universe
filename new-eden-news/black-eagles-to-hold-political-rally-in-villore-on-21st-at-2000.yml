    Blaque), the rally is intended "to remind the citizens of the Gallente Federation
    that we are here to protect them. While forces in other nations stamp on freedoms,
    trample their basic rights, and thrust danger upon them, the SDII is here to preserve
    the core concepts of the Federation: freedom and justice."


    Director Blaque mentioned that, in addition to himself, several notable Gallente
    will be in attendance to support the rally and urge citizens to "do their civic
    duty." Recruiters for the Black Eagles will also be present to receive applications
    from interested Federation citizens who shall then be vetted and contacted at
    a later date.'
