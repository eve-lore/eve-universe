- body: "-+- FROM THE DESK OF ADMIRAL NALMID LEBON -+-  \n  \nGreetings to the honorable
    pilots of the 24th Imperial Crusade:  \n  \nThe honored Heir, his eminence Lord
    Merimeth Sarum, has expressed a personal interest in seeing a team of loyal Amarrian
    soldiers represent the might of the Empire in the upcoming 6th Alliance Tournament.
    To that end, he has committed a small portion of his fortunes to the 24th Imperial
    Crusade in order to pay the entree fee into the tournament.   \n  \nLord Sarum
    has left the selection of the team up to Crusade leadership. As a result, myself
    and the rest of the Crusade's leadership will be monitoring our pilots for their
    contributions to the war effort during the tournament's sign-up period. Those
    three pilots who bring the most victories to the Crusade shall be allowed the
    selection of the Crusade's tournament team captain. The captain will then be responsible
    for the final selection of the team.\n\nFull details of the militia's involvement
    in the alliance tournament may be found [here](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=938724)."
