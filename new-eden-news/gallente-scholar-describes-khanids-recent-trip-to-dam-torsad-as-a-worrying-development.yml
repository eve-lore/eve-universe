    Science Department at the University of Caille today released an official statement
    regarding the apparent thawing of relations between the Khanid Kingdom and the
    Amarr Empire, calling the development \"a worrying development on the international
    scene.\"\n\nRelations between the Amarr Empire and the Gallente Federation have
    been strained since last June, when Amarr sided with the Caldari State after what
    Amarr reporters described as the \"reclaiming of Caldari Prime.\"  Tensions hit
    a fever pitch when the Kador house launched an invasion of Solitude last November,
    despite the very public chastisement of Uriam Kador by Empress Jamyl Sarum, who
    consequently placed Kador's private fleet under the Imperial Navy's direct command.
    \n\nThe prospect of Khanid's forging closer links with the Amarr Empress is being
    monitored by the famous Gallentean University. \"By burying the hatchet on a centuries-old
    dispute, Sarum is showing that she will go to any lengths to strengthen her Empire,\"
    remarked Professor Margant Anjuisselle of the University of Caille.  \"We are
    concerned that the Khanid Navy may now begin passing technology to the Imperial
    Navy.\"  Anjuisselle also pointed out the close relationship that the State has
    historically had with the Khanid Kingdom, suggesting that Caldari would \"indirectly
    benefit from an exchange of technology and intelligence\" between the Khanid and
    Amarr.\n\nIt is understandable that there are concerns: The Khanids have been
    accused on numerous occasions of capturing Gallente citizens, purportedly to be
    sold into the Amarr slave market.  The recent collapse of the Federal Defence
    Union, combined with the news that the former FDU's enemies seem to be aligning,
    should make many citizens of New Eden apprehensive about the future."
