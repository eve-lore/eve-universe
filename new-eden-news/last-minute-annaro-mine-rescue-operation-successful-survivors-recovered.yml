    A dangerous rescue operation aimed at recovering 176 Caldari miners trapped in
    an asteroid proved successful last night . The rescue was performed by an Amarr
    team from Ducia Foundry experienced on unstable asteroids.\n\nReports indicate
    that the miners themselves were not informed of the attempt and spent the evening
    writing final letters to their loved ones. One miner told reporters, \"When I
    heard they were drilling just a few meters away, my first thought was that we
    were hallucinating from the lack of oxygen.\" The surprise rescue operation was
    executed, though, for reasons that remain unclear, only a select few knew about
    the operation. Their secrecy has aroused suspicions that Ducia Foundry was allowed
    to covertly transport and deploy its slave workers to the asteroid mine.\n\nIn
    a brief statement, Ducia Foundry's Steen Greimala said, \"The operation went as
    smoothly as ever. Every member of my team performed admirably, and we were more
    than helped by the Deep Core Mining experts, who analyzed every aspect of the
    asteroid. I never had a point where I was seriously concerned.\"\n\nCBD Corporation
    released a statement saying, \"We welcome the successful rescue of our miners
    and thank Deep Core Mining and Ducia Foundry for their help.\" CBD would not comment
    on the safety procedures they had employed during the mining operation. Police
    commander Garr Diymir was not available for comment.\n\nCaldari law expert Dimm
    Margo remarked, \"I think it's obvious what's happened. They managed to sneak
    the slaves in and get the job done, but there will need to be legal accounting
    sooner or later. Luckily for them, they were successful.\""
