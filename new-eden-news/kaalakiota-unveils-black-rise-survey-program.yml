- body: "Nonni - Kaalakiota Corporation announced today a large-scale survey program
    in the Black Rise region. The initiative aims to discover valuable resources and
    colonization opportunities in Black Rise, and was made possible by the recent
    successes of Caldari militia in the region.                                                  \n\nAccording
    to Niteloho Koirolen, Kaalakiota Corporation chief spokesperson, the program will
    be conducted by both the corporation's intelligence division and the Home Guard,
    the goal being the development of a comprehensive resource database of the Black
    Rise region. The program will survey the planets and moons across 49 systems in
    6 constellations.                                           \n\n\"Today's announcement
    reinforces Kaalakiota's commitment to the development of the Black Rise region,\"
    said Koirolen. \"Although the State had previously done an outstanding job in
    Black Rise, there is still a lot to discover. We are sure that our program will
    ultimately contribute to the welfare of the whole State.\"\n\n The Black Rise
    region borders established Caldari and Gallente space and was previously deemed
    impenetrable, despite many efforts to map it. However, Caldari forces gained access
    to the region and secretly colonized it, Although it is clear that t operations
    in Black Rise persisted for a longer time, experts claim that the region is still
    largely unexplored.\n\n Due to its strategic location, Black Rise was a place
    for large-scale hostilities between Caldari and Gallente militia forces since
    the outbreak of the war. According to Niteloho Koirolen, Kaalakiota's initiative
    is directly linked to the Caldari Navy's efforts. \"I don't think that this would
    have been possible if not for the recent successes of the Caldari State Protectorate
    in Black Rise. I would like to extend my gratitude to all militia pilots who contributed
    to the security of the region, allowing us to embark on this journey of discovery.\""
