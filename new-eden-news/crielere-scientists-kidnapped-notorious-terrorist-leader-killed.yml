    the infamous marauder Jirai \u201CFatal\u201D Laitanen is reported to have been
    killed in a battle against the Crielere station\u2019s loose coalition of defense
    forces. According to sources, Laitanen\u2019s cohort, Korako \u201CThe Rabbit\u201D
    Kosakami, managed to escape from the scene after kidnapping Crielere founders
    Henric Touvolle and Taromi Umailen.  \n  \nEarlier reports that the main Gurista
    force was heading out of Crielere\u2019s neighbouring system Rancer had prompted
    the defenders to give chase into Thelan, three systems away from Crielere, where
    Fatal was reported to have been situated. As the brave defenders chased Fatal
    and his force into the system, a large contingent of Gurista marauders descended
    upon Crielere Laboratories seemingly out of nowhere, revealing the earlier retreat
    to be a diversionary measure. With the station virtually undefended, the terrorists
    were able to strike key points in the complex, causing tremendous damage to the
    multi-billion ISK structure.   \n  \nAs most of the defence force fell back to
    Crielere and reinforcements arrived from other locations, reports came in that
    The Rabbit and his men had breached the station\u2019s perimeter and were making
    their way through the complex. While fighting continued outside the station, Kosakami
    located and subdued Dr. Umailen. After an intense standoff, in which both Fatal
    and the Rabbit mercilessly used Umailen as leverage, Dr. Touvolle was lured into
    their claws. Utilizing what seems to have been a cloaking device of some sort,
    Kosakami then exited the station and under cover of Laitanen\u2019s guns made
    his way to the Olettiers stargate, where he was able to escape with the two scientists.
    The defence forces flooded into Olettiers, where they then managed to break down
    Fatal\u2019s defenses, destroying his ship. As the pirate fled through the gate
    into Olettiers in his escape pod, he was chased down and destroyed by Second Wave
    Inc.'s Security Chief Doc Brown.  \n  \nTonight\u2019s battle was the largest
    yet fought in Crielere, with hundreds of casualties on both sides of the conflict.
    The station itself is said to be heavily damaged, and at this point, if drastic
    measures aren\u2019t taken, experts indicate that a complete core meltdown may
    be imminent. Expect more news from Crielere as the smoke clears."
