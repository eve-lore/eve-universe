    CONCORD Ruling Means Victory for Upwell\n\nCONCORD\u2019s Inner Circle has passed
    a motion declaring hardware infomorph transportation without a legal associated
    body a violation of the Yulai Accords. The decision was celebrated by the member
    corporations of the Upwell Consortium, all of which have been lobbying for the
    motion to pass. It is based on articles of the Yulai Accord introduced by the
    Jovian Directorate during the founding conference in YC0. These articles were
    inspired by the \u201Cone mind one body\u201D principle, a key tenet of Jovian
    society. According to this principle, a sentient mind must always have a single
    associated body and each human body must be associated with no more than one mind.
    When an encrypted mind is transferred to physical storage illegally at Mercenary
    Dens its Upwell workforce body is lost. According to Upwell, this means that during
    the period of transportation, the mind has no legally associated body an is in
    violation of the Yulai Accords. This is different from, for example, warclone
    transit in which infomorphs are stored separate from their bodies, but an associated
    body legally exists.\n\nThe Jovian Directorate left the CONCORD Assembly during
    the Jovian departure of YC117. As the holders of their seats and critics of the
    Deathless Circle, The Society of Conscious Thought was delighted by the decision.
    \u201CA founding principle of our shared civilization has been upheld,\u201D said
    Elder Mentor Matshi Raish, the SOCT\u2019s representative seat holder in CONCORD\u2019s
    Inner Circle. \u201CSo often is our cluster divided, let us enjoy this moment
    and celebrate the essential humanity that unites us all.\u201D\n\nLegal scholars
    have expressed some concerns over the \u201Chasty\u201D ruling. According to Professor
    of Interstellar Law at the University of Caille Laura McLintock, \u201CToday\u2019s
    ruling could be the first step down a slippery slope. Now that transporting stored
    infomorphs is illegal, it opens the way for future challenges to backup clones.\u201D
    CONCORD was quick to dismiss this claim when approached, stating that \u201Cit
    is false rhetoric to conflate these two entirely different cases.\u201D\n\n![Merc
    Den and Skyhook](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/VquUOXqv2CHCs5xXs2hwo/ad04b1e457217a9fab8ec6c782f50d56/mercDen2.png)\n\n###
    Deathless Circle Scrambles to Release Merc Den Update\nOver 4090 Merc Dens have
    reportedly been deployed since designs were first released by the Deathless earlier
    this month. The Informoph transportation law directly targets these Dens, where
    the extraction and transportation of Encrypted Infomorphs has been taking place.
    The Deathless Circle was quick to respond by broadcasting a firmware update to
    all Dens. \n\nThis update appears to be based on the research into the Encrypted
    Infomorphs that have already requested passage to the Warden in Zarzakh. Following
    the update, the TEBS suites inside Merc Dens will no longer extract infomorphs
    onto physical storage, and will instead use the same kind of remote transfers
    employed by capsuleers. \n\nThis method was previously impossible due to Upwell\u2019s
    restrictive encryption but has now been unlocked with the usage of Infomorph Decryption
    keys. These decryption keys will be generated on-site at Mercenary Dens by noninvasive
    scans of workforce clones. The keys can then be uploaded to the Warden in Zarzakh,
    allowing it to decrypt infomorphs remotely as they are transferred. This will
    enable the successful remote transfer directly from the TEBS of any willing infomorph.\n\nIn
    addition to upgrading their transfer capabilities, the new Firmware has enabled
    Mercenary Dens to assign tactical operations. With these changes, the Scope expects
    that New Eden will continue to see den deployments despite Upwell\u2019s legal
    victory.\n\n![Trustbreaker Array](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/3a53V2aibkwVeNm24eLItu/1a04294aa034c900f6c4809c103932ab/trustbreaker.png)\n###
    Deathless Trustbreakers Attacked\n\nNew Deathless \u201CTrustbreaker\u201D arrays
    have been spotted throughout pirate FOB systems. These sites which appear to be
    deployed by Deathless Wraith agents are actively hacking local PDNs (planetary
    defense networks). If these networks fail it would open up planets for ground
    assaults and manual overriding of terrestrial PDN systems. As such it is suspected
    that the Deathless' goal is to open up positions from Vanguard assaults. Whether
    these assaults will be carried out on the behalf of pirate insurgents or mercenary
    counter-pirate forces seems to vary widely, with the implication being that both
    sides of the conflict may be relying on the Deathless developed Vanguard warclones.\n\nSpacetime
    fluctuations observed by SOCT initiatives indicate that many of these Trustbreakers
    are under attack from Drifter forces, perhaps caused by a remote link to the Warden
    in Zarzakh. Deathless Wraiths are offering rewards for support at these sites
    to pro-Deathless capsuleers, but these attacks also create opportunities for those
    who do not support the Deathless to target and destroy their infrastructure. CONCORD
    has issued an official statement urging capsuleers to \u201Cchoose wisely and
    not assist in the slide towards chaos\u201D.\n\n### News in Brief\n- The 10th
    anniversary of \u201CCaroline\u2019s Star\u201D incident marked by vigil for those
    who died in Thera\n\n- Hrada-Oki Caravanmaster Malaya Hrada joins Vo-Lakat Caravan
    leadership and SoE Reverend Mother Santimona Sarpati at vigil.\n\n- Surge in black
    market spirits sales and Mindclash popularity reported following rise of Merc
    Dens.\n\n- Royal Heir Ersilia Kor-Azor opens largest-ever Commoners' Library of
    the Scriptures on Kor-Azor Prime\n\n- AIR celebrates creation of over 5000 corp
    projects since updates launched.\n\n- IRIS pops rare spiced-wine vintage at press
    conference as capsuleer Cicada Adacic sequences 1000th 2-pattern SKIN. \n\n- Equinox
    colony insiders leak that equipment theft has escalated to violent raids attacks
    by parties unknown.\n\n- Agency mercenary network rumored to have purchased large
    quantities of Vanguard warclone \u2018canopics\u2019 from Deathless Circle."
