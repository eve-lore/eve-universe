    Riots in Caille as Controversial \u201CUnited Response Act\u201D Passed\n\nLuminaire,
    Essence \u2013 Riots broke out in Caille today, as protests against controversial
    new government legislation were held across the Federation. An estimated ten million
    protestors crowded into Caille, many travelling from the Federation's outer districts
    to take part in demonstrations against the newly passed \u201CUnited Response
    Act\u201D. \n\nThe United Response Act, passed into law by a narrow margin at
    today's full session of the Federal Senate, includes provisions that will increase
    federal oversight of traditionally district-administered services. This will grant
    central federal authorities the ability to exercise lower-level control over a
    wide range of sectors such as industry, taxation, transportation, and even education.
    \n\nThe bill's proponents in a coalition centered on the Progressive Union party
    had claimed these changes were necessary for an effective and coordinated war
    effort. Detractors, such as Senator Suvio Bellaron of the Federalist-Liberals
    disagree, characterizing the act as an unconstitutional bolstering of federal
    power at the expense of district independence. The highly-divisive legislation
    split parties such as the Labor-Populists and Federalist-Liberals, giving the
    powerful Progressive Union bloc sufficient votes to pass the bill against the
    President Aguard\u2019s opponents in the New Sociocrats.\n\nPresident Celes Aguard,
    regarded as the architect and driving force of the legislation, addressed its
    critics in an address before the Senate in Villore saying:\n\n\u201CDiversity
    and tolerance are the values on which our Federation is founded. The United Response
    Act does not undermine those values, it empowers them. We live in an age of emergent
    threats and unknown possibilities. The Caldari Shipcaster is one such threat,
    and it must not go unanswered. I say that we respond with our greatest strength,
    our cooperation with one another. Together we will not just unlock this technology
    for ourselves, but we will ensure that whatever frontier we face next it will
    be the Gallente who cross it first. This act gives us the tools we need to stand
    as one, united in our response and our purpose, ready to face whatever the future
    might bring!\u201D\n\n![Gallente landscape](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/43xeZgme4vbpiXdtqIFsCq/8deed33e2d5a4ad3a1794667b93f5a0d/Gallente1.png)\n\n###
    Political Opposition in Gallente Senate and Streets\n\nCaille, Gallente Prime
    \u2013 While supporters of the President celebrate her call for unity, critics
    dismissed it as manipulation. At a rally held in Caille\u2019s Liberty Square,
    Senator Thibauld Tailler of the Labor-Populists, one of the bill\u2019s most outspoken
    opponents, responded:\n\n\u201CThe corrupt elites that have hijacked our democracy
    think they can turn our own patriotism against us. They use it to justify their
    interference in the lives of the real Gallente. The people who live far from the
    shining towers of this once great city and the marbled halls of Villore. The people
    who have sweat and bled to build the Federation only to be told they don\u2019t
    know how to defend it. Well, I fought the Caldari menace in orbit of the same
    star that shines down on us now, and I have fought its influence in those marbled
    halls, and I say now to President Aguard you will not turn up late to the battlefield
    and tell us how to fight!\u201D\n\nFollowing the senator\u2019s speech the city\u2019s
    law enforcement tried to contain protestors they claimed had become unruly. Some
    protestors turned to rioting, venting their anger by vandalizing a number of businesses
    founded by Caldari and other foreign interests. President Aguard called on rioters
    to disperse, saying, \u201CWhile I applaud those who exercise their democratic
    right to protest, the Federation will not tolerate acts of violence on its streets.\u201D
    Senator Tailler countered, \u201CIf the President spent less time telling the
    people how to behave and more time listening to them they wouldn\u2019t have to
    take matters into their own hands\u201D.\n\n### News in Brief\n\n- Federation
