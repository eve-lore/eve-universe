- body: "The Federation Senate voted this morning on whether president Foiritan was
    to hold his office or be booted out. Almost 80% of the Senators voted for Foiritan
    to be stripped of office, much more than the two thirds needed. This means that
    presidential elections will be held next December, where the public get their
    say on whether Foiritan is fit to continue as president or if he should leave
    the political arena for good.   \n  \nThe Federation has been in an uproar over
    the last days following Foiritan\u2019s victory in the recent public elections
    held on his referendum for constitutional changes. Many have openly accused Foiritan\u2019s
    administration of mishandling the elections, some even going so far as to say
    that the elections were rigged in Foiritan\u2019s favor. The Senate, who opposed
    the president on his referendum, obviously believes that the public opinion has
    swung in their favor and believes that Foiritan has overstepped the boundaries
    of his authority one time too many. It\u2019s ironic that the very referendum
    that made Foiritan enough enemies in the Senate for him to be voted out now allows
    him to run again in the upcoming elections.   \n  \nSpeculations are already ripe
    for what candidates will vie for the presidency. The rules for entering the run
    are very strict now, following some embarrassing moments some decades ago when
    thousands upon thousands entered the presidential race. Thus, like last time,
    only three candidates are expected. Foiritan is the most likely candidate for
    the Progressive Party, despite the opposition of many of his party members within
    the Senate. Mentas Blaque, leader of the Sociocrats, is also a probable candidate.
    Several more names have been named, but are still only speculations.   \n  \nInteresting
    times are ahead in the Federation as all candidates must carefully choose the
    emissaries that will represent them and promote their cause to the general public.
    More on this later."
