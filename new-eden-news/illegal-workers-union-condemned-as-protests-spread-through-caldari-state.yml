    Illegal Workers Union Condemned as Protests Spread Through Caldari State\n\nNew
    Caldari Prime \u2013 Civil unrest in the Caldari State over new rationing has
    reached new heights as an illegal workers union declares plans for stoppages.
    According to a statement issued by workers from each of the \"Big Eight\" megacorporations,
    strikes will be held throughout the State unless their demands are met. These
    demands include an end to rationing, protections against forced conscription,
    and abandoning the employee corporate classification system. \n\nSigned by \u201CThe
    United Champions of Freedom\u201D, invoking a reference to the Brothers of Freedom
    who led a violent uprising against the corporate state over 15 years ago, the
    statement was delivered via a statewide broadcast over hijacked channels. The
    reader of the statement has been identified as Sumalee Daeng, a former official
    of the Wiyrkomi Corporation State Union (WCSU). As Wiyrkomi's affiliate to the
    Caldari State Workers Union, the WCSU has been quick to disavow Daeng and the
    newly formed United Champions of Freedom (UCF) as \u201Cagitators who refuse to
    do their duty in a time of war.\u201D\n\nThe UCF statement went on to say: \u201COur
    concerns were brought before the corporate and state unions, and fell on deaf
    ears. We have tried to organize protests by peaceful means, and we have been denied.
    Now we secure our right to protest by force. We will not be silenced, nor will
    we fail to defend ourselves in the face of state-sanctioned violence.\u201D This
    has raised concerns that there may be a connection between the UCF and reports
    from several megacorporation manufacturing facilities that a number of military
    vessels and armaments have gone missing.\n\nCEP Chairman Akimaka Saraki has refused
    to acknowledge the illegal UCF union or respond directly to their statement. Executive
    General Heika Torigo was more forthcoming and told the Scope: \u201CThe State
    will not tolerate the theft of State assets or disruption of our critical infrastructure.
    Any who plan to participate in such activities can expect to feel the full force
    of the law. Though we always aim to resolve industrial disputes peacefully, we
    will not be cowed or held hostage by criminal and rebels.\u201D Corporate security
    forces are responding to a number of incidents being described as \"criminal disturbances\"
    and \"terrorist actions\" across the State.\n\n![aguard gal cityscape](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/rZUaDDsuUKKB6gsrEghQt/a4b83a55cb20873dbc02abef9aea119a/aguard_gal_cityscape.png)

    Federation Senate Passes Automated Industry for Democracy Act with Comfortable
    Majority\n\nVillore, Essence \u2013 The Gallente Federation Senate has passed
    the Automated Industry for Democracy Act into law, despite ongoing protests over
    the United Response Act. Two-thirds of the Senate backed the bill proposed by
    President Celes Aguard, which loosens the legal restrictions on AI development.
    This includes an updated definition of Restricted AI that is no longer in conformity
    with all CONCORD guidelines. \n\nPresident Aguard has refused requests to comment
    on any differences between the new Federation legislation and CONCORD\u2019s more
    stringent recommendations but was willing to say that she took the view that the
    Federation's previous laws had been \u201Coutdated\u201D. The President added
    that, \u201Cin order to maintain a competitive advantage the Federation must not
    be afraid to play to its strengths. Advanced robotics has always been one of those
    strengths. The AID Act will free our citizens from drudgery with more efficient
    automation. Let machines do repetitive and taxing work, let the people use their
    talents to build a better future and a stronger democratic nation.\u201D\n\nCONCORD\u2019s
    Department for Restriction on Artificial Intelligence and Life (DERAIL) has issued
    an official statement condemning the changes to Federation law as \u201Creckless\u201D
    and \u201Cshort-sighted\u201D. When asked if CONCORD leadership had any plans
    to intervene, representatives were quick to play down any threat of bringing the
    matter before the Inner Circle or the CONCORD Assembly but added that, \u201CWe
    will be watching closely and judging any future development by our own standards
    \u2013 not by scales asjusted to suit any single empire or nation.\u201D\n\n![caldari
