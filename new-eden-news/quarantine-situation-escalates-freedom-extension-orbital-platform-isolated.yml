- body: 'MUTTOKON - The Scope News Network has learned that the situation in orbit
    of Muttokon II has escalated further this afternoon, after Freedom Extension was
    ordered to untether the orbital platform of their space elevator that serves the
    planet.


    Sources within the corporation have confirmed that the order was issued to the
    Molden Heath Regional Director of Operations for Freedom Extension by Valkear
    General Heder Elislar of the Republic Fleet''s Pator Command early this morning.


    The low orbit platform, which serves as both a shipping platform for freight,
    and as a transit hub for traffic to the surface, is believed to still be populated
    by more than nine hundred thousand people who have been placed in "indefinite
    quarantine" by the Republic Security Services.


    The Matari administration has remained silent on the reasoning for the detainment
    of almost a million individuals who range from maintenance personnel, to transport
    pilots, tourists and commuters, however the Republic Security Services released
    a confirmation earlier today that the severity of the situation has been upgraded
    from a "Class D Localized Containment Event" to a "Class A Full Closure Quarantine
    Operation".


    Sources within Freedom Extension have confirmed that the platform''s services
    have been cut off from the surface, and that emergency separation charges were
    fired roughly two hours ago to sever the physical connection with the elevator''s
    base station, leaving it drifting in orbit.'
