- body: 'Pator - The administration of Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor came under fire during
    a session of the Republic Parliament yesterday. Several members of parliament
    put foward an amendment on a routine financial motion charging that the Minmatar
    Republic is ''in a state of political stasis following the extraordinary assumption
    of powers by Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor and his administration.''


    Yesterday''s parliamentary session was the first full session held for several
    weeks and was made necessary by the strict funding regulations still in place
    in the Republic. These require a motion to approve the quarterly budget of the
    Minmatar Republic which is usually passed as a formality. By convention amendments
    are normally entered against the main annual budget motion only. A number of parliamentarians,
    particularly of the Sebestior and Krusual tribes, have increasingly complained
    about the virtual suspension of the Parliament by Sanmatar Shakor.


    While the Sanmatar has not formally dissolved Parliament, which would trigger
    elections under Republic law, he has relied on a strong government majority in
    Parliament to limit voting sessions to those strictly necessary to run the Republic.
    This majority was on display again yesterday as the entire Brutor parliamentary
    group and significant majorities among other represented tribes voted the critical
    amendment down.


    Before the vote, there were chaotic scenes as the Sebestior parliamentarian Orvas
    Seriador, a noted and radical ''democratist'', railed against Sanmatar Shakor,
    declaring that, "Shakor is a dictator in the making, stifling Minmatar democracy
    while it is still in its infancy." Seriador was booed out of the chamber before
    he could finish his speech supporting the amendment.'
