    President and FIO Warn of Future Threat \n\nThe Gallente Federation has declassified
    documents that they claim prove a major Drifter attack is on the horizon. These
    documents have been published as the \u201CForecaster Report\u201D and contain
    details of Federal Intelligence Office operations into Drifter activities. The
    documents were shared following a joint announcement by President Celes Aguard
    and FIO Director Apaset Orviegnoure. \n\nAccording to President Aguard, the documents
    contain \u201Cevidence of a credible Drifter threat.\u201D She explained that
    the fact the report had been made public was \u201Ca sign of how seriously I take
    the dangers Forecaster outlines and the importance of our preparations. When this
    attack will materialize is unclear, but that it is coming is undeniable\u201D\n\nDirector
    Apaset Orviegnoure added that, \u201CThe FIO is dedicated to the security of our
    citizens first and foremost. The decision to publically share this information
    was not taken lightly, but President Aguard and I agree that hard choices will
    have to be made in the near future. For those choices to be successful the people
    of the Federation will have to understand the reasons behind them.\u201D\n\nAguard
    finished the Press conference by adding \u201COur evidence strongly suggests that
    this coming crisis is the direct result of the Deathless Circles' irresponsible
    use of Jovian artifacts. From their occupation of The Fulcrum to their activation
    of the structure known as The Warden, their greed has put this cluster at risk.
    If it were not for their reckless actions the Drifter forces would have continued
    to remain dormant. As such, we will redouble our commitment to stamping out any
    Circle influence within Federation space.\u201D\n\n![The Warden](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/1Wm5sXtSJErSaJpidVM85h/37b4f28e953a22e29dcaf1b8b8ab7a54/warden.png)\n\n###
    Forecaster Documents Under the Microscope\n\nThe documents, which the Scope has
    carefully examined, are still heavily redacted. What has been shared begins with
    an investigation into Atavum following its retrieval by an FIO agent in October.
    The details of the operation along with the agent\u2019s identity are redacted,
    with the codename \u201CWade\u201D being their only identifier.\n\nFollowing this
    operation, Gallente military scientists have been conducting an investigation
    into the Atavum and their hyperdimensional connection to The Warden. According
    to the declassified documents, the same connections that link the Atavum to the
    Warden shows signs of activity prior to periods of heightened Drifter deployments,
    such as their recent attacks on the Deathless-controlled Trustbreakers. Through
    means that have not been disclosed this has led the FIO to believe they can predict
    a large-scale attack coming in the future. These readings are also combined with
    reports of changes amongst Drifter and Drifter-controlled Sleeper drones inside
    wormholes. \n\nWith much of the documents still redacted, it has not been possible
    for the Scope, or any institution we reached out to, to independently verify their
    results. That said, if accurate, the information contained within is certainly
    cause for alarm.\n\n![Gallente landscape](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/43xeZgme4vbpiXdtqIFsCq/8deed33e2d5a4ad3a1794667b93f5a0d/Gallente1.png)\n\n###
    Nations React to Forecaster Report\n\n__Federation Election Postponed__\n\nPresident
    Aguard has called an emergency Senate session. The session ended with the narrow
    passing of a vote to suspend the upcoming Presidential Election until the Drifter
    crisis has been resolved. The vote passed thanks to surprise support from the
    Labor-Populist. The Labor-Populist party has explained that \u201Cwhile we remain
    critical of President Aguard\u2019s policies, the security of the Federation comes
    first.\u201D \n\nOver the last year, Gallentia Primacy terrorist attacks led by
    former Labor-Populist senator Thibauld Tailler have damaged the party\u2019s reputation.
    Recent polls suggest that if the election had gone ahead as scheduled, the Labor-Populists
    would have experienced a significant loss in seats.\n\n__Empress Reaction Unclear__\n\nThe
    Amarrian Ministry of War and Ministry of Internal Order have issued official responses
    that they are \u201Ctaking Forecaster under advisement\u201D. Since the Siege
    of Zarzakh, concerns over rising Drifter activity have been raised within the
    Empire. These began when veterans of the Amarr-Drifter War petitioned the Empress.
    \n\nRoyal Heir Hamideh Kador has joined their pleas, suggesting that the Empress
    \u201Cput the preservation of our people first\u201D. Empress Catiz I has released
    a brief statement in which she assures the Amarr people that \u201Ctheir prosperity
    and safety are her highest priority.\u201D\n\n__Sanmatar Criticizes Federation__\n\nMeanwhile,
    in the Minmatar Republic Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor has criticized the Gallente for
    \u201Cfostering panic\u201D. At a public address in the Great Caravanserai, he
    assured the Minmatar people that \u201Cwe remain vigilant, but at this time we
    see no need for immediate response.\u201D \n\nThukker Chief Ennar Aeboul called
    the Sanmatar\u2019s address \u201Cbullish optimism\u201D. Many of the caravans
    of the Thukker tribe, especially the Vo-Lakat, have observed changes in Drifter
    deployments that they contend indicate rising danger. The Sanmatar has stated
    in response that he appreciates the Thukker\u2019s concerns, but that so far the
    recent Drifter activity has been entirely targeted at the Deathless Circle.\n\n__Caldari
    Prepare Defensive Response__\n\nIn a surprise move, the Caldari State\u2019s Chief
    Executive Panel has accepted the Federation\u2019s warnings with swift and decisive
    action. On receiving the news, Chairman Akimaka Saraki called an emergency meeting
    of the CEP, and a motion to create a special task force was passed six to two.
    The Kaalakiota and Sukuuvestaa corporations of the Mountain faction were the only
    panel members to oppose the motion. Kaalakiota CEO Haatakan Oiritsuu called the
    motion \u201Chasty\u201D and stated that \u201Csuch action should not be taken
    at the word of our oldest enemy\u201D. \n\nFollowing the meeting, Chairman Akimaka
    Saraki read a statement saying that the \u201CSurvival of the State comes above
    all. While our war with the Federation continues, we have gathered our own evidence
    and believe the Drifter threat to be credible. It was not too long ago that another
    advanced and hostile group attacked our citizens and occupied our worlds. We will
    not risk such an outcome again, we will not let the cacophony of war deafen our
    ears to the rising winds.\u201D \n\n### News in Brief\n\n- Protests break out
