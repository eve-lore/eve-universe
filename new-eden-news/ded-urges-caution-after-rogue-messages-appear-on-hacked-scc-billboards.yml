- body: 'YULAI - The Directive Enforcement Department has issued a statement urging
    caution among capsuleers after the appearance of unauthorized messaging on SCC
    billboards across the cluster.


    The messages, which began to appear at some time this morning, seem at this stage
    to be linked to the group of rogue pilots identifying themselves as "Valkyrie",
    and urge capsuleers to attack Guristas assets in the wake of allegations that
    the pirate organization is performing unregulated human experiments on captured
    pilots.


    Brigadier General Odo Korachi of the DED''s Genesis Fleet released a statement
    just moments ago, calling for caution among independent capsuleers when investigating
    exposed Guristas assets. In the statement, he recommended that "independent, commercially
    licensed capsuleers should proceed with extreme caution when investigating Guristas
    assets identified by this group of pilots. At this stage, their motive is unknown,
    and the Directive Enforcement Department is on high alert while a full assessment
    of the situation takes place."


    During the press conference, General Korachi also confirmed that "at this stage,
    intelligence suggests that these rogue pilots may be a splinter group, or a rogue
    cell of the Guristas which has turned against the organization" and that it is
    "very possible that this group of pilots may be born of the alleged experimentation
    that has been taking place".


    The Scope has also received unconfirmed reports from a notable source within the
    Caldari Navy that the Guristas Pirates appear to have established business relations
    with a newly emerged outlaw group identified only as "Schism", after a Caldari
    Navy monitoring array in the region of Branch intercepted and partially decoded
    a series of transmissions between the two groups yesterday evening.'
