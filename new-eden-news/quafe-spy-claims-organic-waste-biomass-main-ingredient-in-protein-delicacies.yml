- body: "Quafe has released information it\u2019s acquired that proves beyond doubt
    that the main ingredient in Protein Delicacies is organic waste, processed station
    sewage and second grade biomass. An agent hired by Quafe managed to infiltrate
    one of the heavily guarded Sukuuvestaa factories manufacturing the popular product
    and there discovered this ugly truth. This stunning revelation casts a new light
    on why Sukuuvestaa managed to produce the Delicacies so very cheaply. Ordinary
    organic waste is processed using advanced bio-smelting methods into a protein
    mass, which then has artificial flavoring added.  \n  \nThe outrage that will
    surely follow this disclosure is certain to ruin the Protein Delicacy business
    and many are already talking about compensations and law suits against the manufacturer,
    Sukuuvestaa Corporation."
