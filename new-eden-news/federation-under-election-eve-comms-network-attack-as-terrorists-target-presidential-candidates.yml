- body: "**BREAKING:** Luminaire, Essence  - The Gallente Federation is under attack.
    At least three of the leading presidential candidates have been attacked in a
    series of co-ordinated terrorist strikes. The communications networks of the Federal
    Administration are heavily disrupted, and several major planets have been virtually
    blacked out from the FTL net by what appears to be a parallel sequence of network
    attacks ahead of the Presidential elections.\n\nWhile many accounts are confused
    or unconfirmed, multiple sources have reported the following events:\n\nPresident
    Jacus Roden is secure, has declared a Federal State of Emergency, and mobilized
    the entire active list and reserves of the Federation armed forces. The Federation
    Navy and Marines have been ordered to invasion defense positions.\n\nGovernor
    Celes Aguard's motorcade was attacked in a major bombing outside the New Riennes
    Stadium on Mies IV. Massive casualties are reported. The status of Governor Aguard
    is unknown at this time. Mies system comms networks are sporadically dropping
    in and out of service.\n\nSeveral reports indicate that \"multiple explosions\"
    and/or \"a gas attack\" took place at the Intaki Assembly Chambers while Senator
    Suvio Bellaron was giving a presidential campaign speech. Intaki Prime's planetary
    communications networks are almost all offline and connections to the Intaki system
    and Federal FTL relays have collapsed. The status of Senator Bellaron and the
    members of the Intaki Assembly is unknown.\n\nMayor Shaileen Ramnev's flight into
    Arcurio reportedly downed by missile strike on final approach. The presidential
    candidate was enroute to eve of election rally in home city. The status of Mayor
    Ramnev is unknown and Caldari Prime has been hit by a near total communications
    blackout.\n\nMannar Seginde in Leremblompes system has suffered a similar communications
    blackout to those affecting Caldari Prime and Intaki Prime. While there has been
    no report of an attack on Councillor Wayaki Kayara, another contender for the
    presidency, he was last known to be present in the capital of the adopted Mannar
    homeworld.\n\nSenator Kelen Ontbad is reported to be secure aboard the Parchanier
    V Egonics Inc. Development Studio, having been there to record an election eve
    \"EgoCast\" in support of his presidential campaign. Communications with the Egonics
    station are being routed through the relatively unaffected capsuleer channels
    and Senator Ontbad has apparently been moved to the capsuleer quarter by station
    security.\n\nChief Director of the Federal Intelligence Office Mentas Blaque has
    resumed his duties, having recused himself from active FIO service during his
    own presidential campaign, and was last reported to be in session with President
    Roden and the Federal Security Council. Scattered reports from Luminaire, Renyn
    and Villore are claiming that there were attacks on FIO offices in those systems.
    Chief Director Blaque's campaign schedule had him attending a rally in Hueromont
    on Gallente Prime later this evening.\n\nThe Federal Elections Commission has
    convened an emergency session at the instigation of President Roden and the Federal
    Military Commission. Widespread disruptions of the Federal Administration networks
    are ongoing and overstressed commercial networks are close to collapse. A significant
    number of heavily populated systems and planets are experiencing reduced bandwidth,
    erratic connections or outright blackouts. These network conditions evidently
    place the technical ability to run the Presidential and Senatorial Elections in
    jeopardy, even were it decided to continue following terror attacks on at least
    three leading presidential candidates.\n\nSo far, no party has credibly claimed
    responsibility for the terrorist attacks on presidential candidates or the comms
    network attacks.\n\n**BREAKING NEWS**\n\n  * Governor Celes Aguard Reported Killed
