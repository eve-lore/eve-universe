- body: "Minmatar Republic officials this morning lodged a formal complaint with CONCORD,
    stating that according to security footage and docking transcripts, two Caldari
    Navy vessels had illegally docked at a Republic Fleet station in Matari-controlled
    space last night, reportedly in search of missing Caldari pharmacologist Ullia
    Hnolku.   \n  \nAccording to article 37a of the Yulai Convention, vessels of national
    navies are explicitly forbidden from docking at other national navies\u2019 stations
    if those stations are within the confines of the owning navy\u2019s borders. Exceptions
    are granted only through specific written permission and statement of intent,
    both of which must go through proper CONCORD channels beforehand.   \n  \n\u201CWe
    realize they\u2019re in a crisis, but that does not give them the right to step
    on international law any way they see fit,\u201D stated Republic Parliament Head
    Malaetu Shakor this morning. \u201CThe Caldari State has to realize it represents
    only one entity in the pan-galactic playground, and you can only step on others
    so many times before others start pushing back.\u201D   \n  \nThe State has a
    history of similar oversights: in August of last year, Ishukone Watch vessels
    were repeatedly spotted on the Matari side of the Caldari/Minmatar border zone,
    scanning passersby and inconveniencing travelers. Neither the Ishukone corporation
    nor the Chief Executive Panel issued any sort of diplomatic comment on that matter,
    a fact believed to contribute to the current sour state of relations with the
    Republic. A similar, though unpublicized, incident took place in Gallente space
    a few months later, where Caldari Navy vessels went searching for Gurista operatives
    believed to hold stolen schematics for as-yet unreleased ship designs. Their maneuverings
    within Gallente space provoked protests from the Federation, which also went unanswered
    by the CEP.   \n  \n\u201CThe State has a long, proud tradition of obstinacy in
    diplomatic affairs,\u201D says Roger Montand, professor of political science at
    the University of Caille. \u201CNow they have this missing scientist problem on
    their hands, and they need to be able to move their people freely, but they\u2019re
    just not trusted. The situation certainly wouldn\u2019t be so bad had the State
    actually given diplomacy its due course instead of digging their heels in and
    staying stubbornly quiet every time they were questioned as to their little slips.
    As it stands, they\u2019re paying the price.\u201D   \n  \nNeither the Chief Executive
    Panel nor the Caldari Navy have commented at this point."
