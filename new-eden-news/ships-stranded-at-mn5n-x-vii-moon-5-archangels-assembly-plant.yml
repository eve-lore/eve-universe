- body: The docks at MN5N-X VII - Moon 5 - ArchAngels Assembly Plant have had some
    problems with the gravity-generating mechanism recently. The situation got out
    of control earlier today when the system failed as a cargo of livestock was being
    unloaded leaving the poor animals floating helplessly in zero gravity. Docking
    operators are working on removing the animals from the facilities and ships will
    be unable to undock until the job is done. Pilots are advised to stay away from
    MN5N-X VII - Moon 5 until the situation has been resolved or risk being stuck
    there for some time.
