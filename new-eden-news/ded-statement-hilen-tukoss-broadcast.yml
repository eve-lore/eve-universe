    Directive Enforcement Department has become aware of a [broadcast that has been
    aired by The Scope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i12yk3fZVHw) this evening,
    which reportedly shows imagery of missing scientist Dr. Hilen Tukoss and an as
    yet unidentified structure surrounded by what appears to be a Drifter fleet.\n\nEifyr
    & Co have confirmed Scope News reports that a member of staff was responsible
    for the leak of the footage, which was handed to the news network without the
    corporation's authorization. The Directive Enforcement Department has been able
    to ascertain, with the assistance of the Secure Commerce Commission, that the
    stolen footage was sold to The Scope for a considerable sum, by an employee of
    Eifyr & Co who has since been detained for questioning under the Interstellar
    Corporate Espionage Act YC36.\n\nOn discovering the nature of the footage, its
    content, and the potential security risk surrounding its release, the Directive
    Enforcement Department strongly advised The Scope Galactic News Network to refrain
    from broadcasting the footage until such time as full analysis could be completed,
    the archived video could be accurately dated, and those close to Dr. Tukoss could
    be contacted and briefed on the situation.\n\nSince the footage remains the property
    of Eifyr & Co, the Directive Enforcement Department were only in a position to
    advise on the potential implications of its release through improper channels.
    This advice was offered, and The Scope chose to publish the archived footage regardless,
    citing CONCORD Freedom of Press legislation. In response, the Directive Enforcement
    Department has chosen to detain both Gaunia Octeyncaere, Production Manager for
    The Scope and Lina Ambre, Correspondant for The Scope for questioning under Section
    6 of the Interstellar Corporate Espionage Act.\n\nAt this time, no criminal charges
    have been filed against any individuals or The Scope Galactic News Network, pending
    a full investigation by the Directive Enforcement Department into the age of the
    footage, its content, and the duration of time it may have been in holding within
    the databanks of Eifyr & Co.\n\nThe Directive Enforcement Department will release
    further information as the situation develops, with the approval of the Inner
    Circle.\n\nArve Vesren  \nDirector Of Operations  \nDirective Enforcement Department
