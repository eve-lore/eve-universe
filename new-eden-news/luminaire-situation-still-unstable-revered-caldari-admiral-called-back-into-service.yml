- body: 'LUMINAIRE - A Caldari Navy spokeswoman confirmed this morning that retired
    Admiral Visera Yanala has been drafted back into service. The unprecedented move
    comes after widespread unrest erupted on Caldari Prime late last week, in response
    to a breach of the Gallente border by Caldari forces.


    Presently serving on ceremonial duty and as senior military advisor to both the
    Caldari Navy and the Caldari Provincial Directorate, she will resume her position
    as Kimotoro Fleet Admiral in command of the Leviathan-class titan _Shiigeru_ ,
    which currently resides in orbit of the besieged planet.


    In an interview with Echelon Entertainment, Admiral Yanala expressed that she
    is "delighted with such an unexpected opportunity to return to active service
    with the Caldari Navy." When asked about her history with the _Shiigeru_ , she
    added that "she was under my command for a little over half a century. I know
    every subsystem of her better than I know myself. It will be an honor and a privilege
    to take to her helm again."


    Admiral Mininela Erinen, commanding officer of the Caldari Navy, expressed her
    gratitude in the same interview adding that "as a young NCO with the Caldari Navy,
    one of my earliest role models was Admiral Yanala during her initial years serving
    as commander of the _Shiigeru_. It is an honor to have her resume leadership of
    the Kimotoro fleet under my command. Her presence at the helm of one of the Caldari
    Navy ''s longest serving and most fierce warships is exactly what is needed to
    bring the situation in Luminaire under control."


    Reports suggest that Yanala has already returned to the _Shiigeru_ , however the
    effect that her presence may have on planet side hostilities is yet to be seen
    as widespread unrest is still reported in the cities of Arcurio and Tovil.'
