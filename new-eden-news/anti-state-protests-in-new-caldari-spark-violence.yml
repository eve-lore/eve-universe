- body: "Just as it cleared itself from one scandal, the State has found itself mired
    in another, as a freighter belonging to the Anti-State movement the Brothers of
    Freedom was downed in New Caldari. The death toll currently stands at approximately
    65,000, with final numbers almost impossible to attain. \n\nIt is understood that
    a Charon freighter piloted by Uhaera Kuomai, a member of the Brothers of Freedom,
    was destroyed approximately 100km from the Chief Executive Panel station in New
    Caldari, where it was ferrying protesters numbering in the tens of thousands.
    Kuomai himself perished in the attack, along with every single crew member and
    protester aboard. Experts estimate that tens of thousands may have survived the
    initial onslaught, but eyewitnesses confirmed the destruction of the wreck itself
    and thus the death of everyone aboard. \n\nIn a Galnet [communication](\u201Chttp://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=518501\u201D)
    labeled \u201CThe time has come for change\u201D, CEO and leader of the Brothers
    of Freedom, Melarius Torvil announced the protest, two days prior to it taking
    place on the 12th. \u201CThe countless voices of the oppressed and abused are
    gathering, we shall stand united, and be heard throughout the stars,\u201D stated
    the press release. In the communication, pilots of the Caldari Independent Navy
    Reserve, one of the most prominent Pro-State capsuleer corporations, claimed that
    the protest \u201Cwould not be worth the ammunition\u201D and denounced the use
    of violence to quell the uprising. \n\nOnly a little over 24 hours later, they
    were sighted destroying the freighter alongside a corporation known as the Guardian
    Shadows. In an interview only minutes after the downing of the freighter, CAIN
    pilot Hurs Sokira claimed: \u201CIt was designed to gather as much bystanders
    as possible and then trigger a mass riot, right in front of the media and the
    public.\u201D CAIN\u2019s involvement was confirmed the following day in a short
    [press release](\u201Chttp://cain.excidium.net/news.html?id=17\u201D) issued by
    Captain Scarlet on CAIN\u2019s own information portal: \u201CI can confirm that
    Reserve vessels did indeed participate in the interception of that vessel, though
    only after being informed that the freighter posed an imminent threat to the station
    itself.\u201D \n\nFurther details were not immediately available and it still
    remains at this time, uncertain whether or not the Brothers of Freedom and their
    rally did indeed represent any threat. Many have claimed that the rally was supposed
    to be a non-violent procession, and in light of this widely-perceived notion,
    the attack has sparked outrage across the cluster, even in the Federation, which
    had a visiting high-ranking official present in the system at the time. \n\nFollowing
    the outrage from the attack, CAIN diplomat and Captain Svetlana Scarlet issued
    the following statement on Galnet: \n\n_The events of yesterday were extremely
    regrettable; it is never a good thing when that many lives are lost, regardless
    of the reason. At this time, we are investigating the actions taken by Reserve
    officers yesterday to determine whether or not their response was appropriate,
    and whether any disciplinary action should be taken\u2026we are taking this very
    seriously and\u2026our ultimate goal is for the facts of the case to be firmly
    established. This matter has assumed highest priority for Reserve personnel and
    we intend to make sure this matter is resolved within a matter of days._\n\nOn
    the 21st, the Board published its findings in a second [press release](\u201Chttp://cain.excidium.net/news.html?id=19\u201D).
    In a display of self-accountability it denounced the \u201Clack of judgment\u201D
    of CAIN staff, and handed out fines and demotions to each pilot. In addition the
    flag staff admitted they should have been in command of the fleet and \u201Corders
    in the matter should have been considerably more clear.\u201D \n\nThe board has
    called for further investigation into a number of areas by State authorities,
    offering to pay for the them entirely out of CAIN\u2019s corporate accounts. It
    laid out three areas of concern and uncertainty, and promised full co-operation
    with any official investigation. \n\nThe destruction of the ship and all it\u2019s
    crew will leave little in the way of direct evidence for any investigative team.
    Opinion is so far, divided on just what the Brothers of Freedom had in mind with
    some 65,000 estimated activists inbound to the CEP station. Whether or not an
    official investigation into the matter will be conducted remains unclear at this
    time."
