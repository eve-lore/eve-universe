- body: "Pator - At an emergency session of parliament this evening, Sebiestor Tribal
    Chief Karin Midular called for emergency elections to be held no later than a
    week from today. Her directive came hard on the heels of a speech given by Keitan
    Yun, the Republic's former ambassador to CONCORD, in which the ambassador called
    for former Parliament Head Maleatu Shakor to return to Minmatar politics. \n\n\"The
    Gallente had a dream, and they called this dream democracy,\" said the Ambassador
    in his speech. \"This dream was given to the Republic in its infancy and held
    to be the right and true way for a civilized society to govern. We now stand in
    the shattered remains of this dream with one unavoidable truth facing us: democracy
    has failed.\" \n\n\"It did not fail because of lack of good leaders. In my opinion,
    we had one of the best. It did not fail because of a fault in the system. The
    success of a democratic Federation has lasted long enough to bear this out. The
    Gallente are gripped by neither poverty nor disenchantment. They do not suffer
    our lack of identity and unity. No, democracy did not fail because we did not
    try. On these things we cannot be faulted.\" \n\n\"Democracy failed because it
    was not our dream. It was not for the Minmatar. We are a people not easily led,
    and brothers and sisters, on a precipice we now stand. If we continue to bicker
    and argue amongst ourselves without heed for our people\u2019s needs, we will
    fall. We need change. We need strength.\" \n\n\"There was once a Minmatar Nation
    that thrived before the Amarr came. I would see that Nation reborn, its tribes
    united. I would see us have a leader to give strength and solidarity to those
    united tribes. I would call upon Emissary Maleatu Shakor to return, to finish
    what he started. Now is the time to stand as who we are, true Minmatar.\" \n\nAs
    Ambassador Yun finished his speech, a few delegates rose to challenge his remarks.
    Their protestations continued for a few moments but were quickly quelled by the
    tribal chiefs. Sebiestor Chief Karin Midular then replaced Ambassador Yun on the
    podium. \n\n\"I was a champion of this dream, and I have lived it in every waking
    hour of my life as Prime Minister,\" she said. \"It pains me beyond measure to
    admits its failure. But this pain is a relief, sharp and bright, for it heralds
    the true awakening of our purpose as a united people.\" \n\n\"We go now down a
    path that's new and uncharted, and yet its ancient direction is familiar to us.
    In this I have full faith that we will find success, provided we remember who
    we are and why we are on this path.\" \n\n\"So, as we transition from our dream
    to the waking world at last, it is my final task to start this new journey, to
    prepare the way for the great men and women who shall lead us to freedom at last.
    With the support of the chiefs of this Republic I call into immediate effect Article
    341a of the Republic Charter and issue an emergency election of parliament, no
    later than a week from today.\" \n\nDrastically reduced numbers were in attendance
    at the session, following the murders last week of several parliament members
    along with hundreds of other Minmatar government officials. Despite the small
    turnout, the proceedings were frequently marred by chaos, as several issues were
    vocally raised with the Republic's current situation since the June 6 dissolution
    of parliament. Few of their queries were answered, with tribal chiefs generally
    stepping up to quieten down their respective members"
