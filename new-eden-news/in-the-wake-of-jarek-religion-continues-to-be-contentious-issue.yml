- body: "![](http://www.eve-mercury.net/images/mercurybanner.png)  \n  \nPator - The
    murder of Abel Jarek several weeks ago in what seems to be a religiously-motivated
    attack has highlighted growing tensions over the Amarr faith gaining a foothold
    in the Republic. According to a survey by the Republic University, most Nefantar
    and a significant portion of other recent immigrants from the Mandate and the
    Empire are choosing to keep their Amarrian religious beliefs. While this segment
    of the population remains a tiny minority, according to the survey such a minority
    was, just a few years ago, \"so small as to be nearly nonexistent.\"  \n  \nNowhere
    is this clash of cultures more evident than on Matar. Though Jarek's Salvation
    township was the most obvious of the new Amarr religious communities, it was not
    the only one. In the low-rent districts where many immigrants have settled, makeshift
    \"churches\" have been established in backrooms and empty warehouses, often advertised
    only by word of mouth.\n\nEven before Jarek's death, many within the immigrant
    communities feared similar attacks. \"Many people do not understand that the word
    of God is universal,\" said Dovirch Brettirdur, pastor of one of these small churches.
    \"They see our faith as brainwashing, or an attempt by the Amarr to infiltrate
    the Republic, when nothing could be further from the truth. We only want to make
    his light available to those who seek it.\"  \n  \nUnfortunately, for many outside
    these communities, it is impossible to separate the Amarr faith from the Amarr
    Empire and its history with the Republic. Perhaps most ironically, some of the
    strongest critics of this minority have been other recent immigrants, many of
    whom were enslaved until recently.  The fact that many of these people often live
    in the same or nearby neighborhoods only intensifies the problem. While Republic
    government authorities as high as Sanmatar Shakor have said they are committed
    to ensuring the safety of all Minmatar citizens, regardless of tribe or religion,
    many of the people in these communities remain skeptical about the commitment
    of those charged with protecting those rights, noting that Jarek's murderers still
    remain at large."
