- body: "Gallente Presidential candidate Eman Autrech at a press conference this morning
    announced that he is withdrawing his candidacy for the Gallente Presidential seat.
    The announcement follows several months of census taking and legal maneuvering
    within the Federation, circumstances which have seen the indeterminate delay of
    election proceedings.   \n  \nIn his statement, the former presidential hopeful
    claimed that \"due to the apparent flaws present in our mode of government, my
    faith that the system works as intended is greatly diminished. While my reasons
    for bowing out of this race are personal in nature, I am certain the untenable
    situation we are presented with would have compelled me to withdraw before long.
    The Federation's intolerable census-stalling and gerrymandering is making a mockery
    of this democracy, and I will not stand for it any longer.\"   \n  \nMembers of
    Autrech's campaign have expressed dismay at the announcement, though according
    to his chief campaign treasurer Louis Grells, it's been \"a long time coming.\"
    \  \n  \n\"Campaigning for this length of time takes its toll,\" he said. \"The
    coffers were beginning to run dry and our team had lost nearly a quarter of its
    original number. I'd say we were nearing the end, anyway.\"   \n  \nAlready the
    announcement is being hailed by pundits as an indication of the inadequacy of
    democracy at this level of government. Victor Roanon, representative of radical
    political think-tank the Trauberge Hollow Institute on Bourynes III, this afternoon
    called the proceedings \"typical of the farce democracy rapidly turns into when
    you try to get it working under an umbrella of five trillion people.\"   \n  \nStill
    others point to the circumstances surrounding Autrech's stepping down as extremely
    suspect. A member of his campaign, speaking on condition of anonymity, claimed
    the candidate had seemed unusually distraught and unfocused in the weeks leading
    up to the announcement. \"It was like one day he was Mr. Autrech and the next
    he was just someone else. It was very unsettling.\"   \n  \n\"Plus, if anyone
    understands the system, it's him. He knows as well as anyone that the bout of
    legal wrangling is finally ending. This is a very strange time for him to drop
    out.\""
