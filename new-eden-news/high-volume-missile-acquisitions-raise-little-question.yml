- body: "Market and customs agents have noted a recent upswing in the purchase and
    movement of missiles within Caldari regions. It has been reported by some pilots
    that large quantities of missiles are being delivered to specific individuals
    for well above their market price. \n\nOver the past few days offers of millions
    of isk for delivery of large quantities of missiles, ranging from light to cruise,
    have been publicly solicited across open Caldari channels. Eager and enterprising
    pilots have stepped up to the call delivering possibly hundreds of thousands of
    explosive ordinance to the requestor within Caldari space. \n\nWhile few speculate
    wildly about the implications of these events, others don\u2019t give it a second
    thought. Regardless many pilots remain willing and ready to provide goods to whatever
    ends. The true destination for these goods is still a mystery. \n\nMarket analysts
    and other security professionals are regarding the issue as a market fluctuation,
    with cause for no undue concern."
