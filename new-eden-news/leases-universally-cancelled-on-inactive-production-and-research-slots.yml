- body: "In an emergency meeting convened at the Secure Commerce Committee's Headquarters
    today, committee delegates from each of the empires have agreed that all publicly
    rented manufacturing and research slots in stations that come under SCC legislation
    (effectively, most of the stations in the known universe) will have their leases
    cancelled if it is found that the facilities are not being put to use during the
    rental period. The stated purpose for this new agreement is \"to further encourage
    the growth of industrial competition in order to strengthen the galactic economy.\"
    \  \n  \nThe SCC has put plans in motion to appoint specialized inspectors at
    each station who will monitor the facilities in order to ensure that station resources
    are not being put to waste while, as an anonymous delegate put it, \"the smaller
    entrepreneurs, the life-blood of a healthy economy, are left in the cold.\""
