- body: Yesterday two of the cultists responsible for the attack in the Roushzar system
    were attacked and killed deep in Minmatar space. A small group of these fanatics
    were at their midday prayer in the Gukarla system when they were assaulted by
    a group of patriotic Minmatars. Leading the attack were G'Quan, Loctar and Estios,
    the three of them promptly destroying the zealots ships. Intelligence agencies
    have been on the lookout for other members of the Tetrimon cult, they predict
    at least five prominent members are still on the loose. There has been no sign
