    WERAROIX - A routine ore hauler customs check yesterday uncovered a cargo that
    officials are still at a loss to explain. The ship was carrying supplies to be
    traded at Yvaeroure, where they were to make their next pick up. Among those supplies
    was a container of individually wrapped pills, unidentified except for the word
    ''Liberty'' etched into each one.


    Upon analysis of the pills it was discovered that each one contained a small cluster
    of nanobots, the function of which is still unknown. The crew was held for questioning,
    but none of them, nor anyone on the colony in Yvaeroure, has claimed any knowledge
    of how the cargo came to be on the ship, or what the pills'' purpose is.'
