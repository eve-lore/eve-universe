    the existence of dozens of abandoned stations in the outer regions, CONCORD stunned
    government leaders and civilians again with the announced discovery of an uncharted
    network of jumpgates surrounding Empire space. The origin of the gates is linked
    to the mysterious Immensea organization, but not yet fully understood. The network
    was designed to enable a ship to reach almost any unregulated system without ever
    crossing Empire borders.   \n  \nThe following text is the official CONCORD press
    release:   \n  \n\u201CPursuant to our ongoing investigation into the abandoned
    Immensea stations, our scouts have discovered a network of uncharted jumpgates
    which routes almost every deep-space region directly to each other. They were
    built for the explicit purpose of creating back-door accessibility to the systems
    in unregulated space, completely eliminating the need to traverse Empire territory
    to reach them. These gates are believed to have played a crucial role in the construction
    of the Immensea outposts. Without them, it seems highly improbable that they would
    have been able to move the enormous amounts of materials, manpower, and resources
    required to build these stations in such a short period of time without being
    noticed by Empire surveillance assets.   \n  \n\u201CThe jumpgate\u2019s engineering
    is primarily a Gallente design but with some slight modifications. It is apparent
    that the builders took some shortcuts to hasten construction time and were forced
    to manufacture custom parts which could not be purchased from Empire corporations
    or governments without risking exposure. It is unknown at this time how the builders
    obtained the engineering schematics for Gallente jumpgates. Preliminary findings
    indicate that the oldest gates are located adjacent to Amarr and Minmatar controlled
    space, and that their construction predates the oldest of the Immensea outposts.
    \  \n  \n\u201CBy comparing the age and placement of these jumpgates throughout
    space, a pattern emerges which supports a theory suggesting that the Immensea
    came into contact with the architects of the gates, and forged a partnership which
    allowed for significant acceleration of both projects. With access to the Immensea
    bases, the gate builders would no longer have to smuggle equipment through Empire
    shipping lanes to construction sites. Conversely, the Immensea could use the gates
    to push deeper into unregulated space with decreasing reliance on Empire trade
    routes to accelerate their own expansion.\u201D   \n  \n\u201CThis theory assumes
    that the deep space jumpgate construction project did not have the knowledge or
    support of any of the member governments on the CONCORD Assembly.\u201D   \n  \n\u201CWe
    have conclusive evidence that the gates have been and continue to be used extensively
    by outlaw organizations which include the Serpentis, Angel Cartel, Guristas, and
    Blood Raiders. Like the Immensea\u2014whom we do not yet suspect of directly participating
    in pirate operations\u2014these cartels benefited directly from the construction
    of the gates, and thus explains how their industrial and military capacity has
    been able to keep pace or even exceed Empire growth. The unrestricted access to
    both abundant resources and a transportation network that circumvents Empire space
    has enabled them to thrive with minimal risk of interference from law enforcement
    agencies.\u201D   \n  \n\u201CThe exact locations of these gates are currently
    being added to the CONCORD Navigational Services World Map. We remind you that
    these areas are well outside the jurisdiction of the DED. Ship captains are advised
    to use extreme caution when approaching them. The pirate organizations that have
    been using these gates exclusively to this point are not likely to be welcoming
    of foreigners.\u201D   \n  \n\u201CCommander Tantoseisen Kakkichi has been an
    active participant in our continuing investigation and has made invaluable contributions
    to our progress thus far. However, until such time as we feel confident that a
    thorough understanding of the Immensea and the jumpgate architects is achieved,
    the gag order will remain in effect. We will release more information at the appropriate
    time.\u201D   \n  \nRepresentatives from each of the CONCORD Assembly members
    are planning to release statements in response to this latest development."
