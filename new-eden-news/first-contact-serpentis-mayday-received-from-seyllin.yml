- body: "SEYLLIN - A distress call from a Serpentis freighter stranded in Seyllin
    has reached the blockades surrounding the system. According to sources, a mechanical
    failure dropped the vessel out of warp before it could reach the nearest stargate.
    After a partial repair of the drive, its captain attempted to return to Seyllin
    I rather than warp out of the system. In a voice transcript of the distress call,
    the Serpentis captain states \"To anyone who's listening, Seyllin's not there
    anymore. You hear me? Seyllin-one is gone, do not attempt to approach...\"  \n
    \ \nThe transmission stops after that. No additional information is available
    as CONCORD and the Federation Navy continue to maintain a blockade of the system."
