    The Scope cannot verify the veracity of this individual\u2019s account of events
    and their opinions do not represent the opinions of the Scope. We trust that our
    readers have the capacity to decide for themselves what is an appropriate degree
    of skepticism to apply to the following narrative.\n\nMy decisions often begin
    life as they exit my mouth, long before they have made their way to my brain.
    By that time the opportunity to avoid any particular outcome has long since passed,
    freeing me of the need for any pretense of foresight. Yet as I was marched through
    dark corridors, flanked on either side by the augmented faces of Deathless agents,
    a thought did occur to me without first being voiced. The thought that perhaps
    my actions do have consequences.\n\nBroadly speaking, the missives I forward to
    you have engendered two equally powerful yet opposite reactions in Zarzakh\u2019s
    residents. The first and most surprising of these is delight. Strangers calling
    me \u201Cthe Report lady\u201D  desperately thrust free beverages into my hands.
    While I may not cherish the name, the drinks themselves are appreciated. I find
    this reaction is most common with the newly embodied clones that have recently
    begun pouring into the Fulcrum. Their former lives haunting Upwell\u2019s skyhooks
    were drab enough that reading the Scope qualified as entertainment. Since they
    began arriving, I have been introduced to a wide array of drinking songs that
    demonstrate great poetic skill entirely focused on identifying dirty words that
    rhyme with \u2018Consortium\u2019.\n\nThe second and more predictable reaction
    is violence. Luckily I am an expert in avoidance and have managed to pull off
    enough unannounced exits to retain almost all of my teeth. I was debating the
    risks of my continued residency on this knife\u2019s edge when I came face-to-chrome
    with the aforementioned Circle agents.\n\nFew are invited to delve beneath the
    neon crust of the Fulcrum\u2019s more populous areas, and I have always been glad
    not to be one of them. The agents had no interest in my protests. Hiking through
    the unlit halls of this fallen kingdom has a way of making a person feel about
    as significant as a mote of dust, not to mention the unmistakable paranoia that
    radiates from every dark corner. It is like being at once both inside the belly
    of a whale and between the eyes of a tiger.\n\nEventually, we emerged onto a grand
    platform that spanned a far grander chasm. At the far end atop a simple throne
    sat the king of nowhere himself, The Deathless. I, like most who live here, had
    never seen the man in person before. It is not an experience I would recommend.\n\nIn
    place of a crown, he wears a wreath of tentacles that rise up from his back into
    the metallic guts of the Fulcrum itself. His face is like chipped ice, save for
    those eyes that burn right through you. As he stared at me I began to fear I had
    only been brought there so that he could watch while his followers tossed me into
    the vanishing abyss below. Instead, he asked that I come closer.\n\nAs I reluctantly
    approached he spoke. He told me the Circle did not come here to \u201Cbuild a
    kingdom of secrets\u201D. That he was glad that my Reports had been published,
    and that the people of New Eden needed to be prepared for the truth. In my experience
    truth is a mirror, it has as many faces as there are people looking.\n\nI asked
    him why he didn't just tell people this \u2018truth\u2019 himself. \u201CDeclaration
    is the folly of empires,\u201D he replied, \u201Cand silence the hubris of tyrants.
    Only discovery sparks understanding.\u201D As he spoke I felt it resonate through
    my very bones. \n\n\u201CIs that why you brought all these infomorphs here?\u201D
    I asked, my mouth deciding on the question before my brain had a chance to intervene.
    \u201CIt is one reason,\u201D he responded, and as he spoke the chasm below creaked
    out a discordant note. The Deathless twitched, and I was reminded for a moment
    that I was speaking with a human being, or at least something close enough to
    one to still be capable of flinching. \u201CWe have no purpose if our purpose
    is not guidance,\u201D he said, perhaps to me but perhaps not. \n\nHe told me
    that the Fulcrum was \u201Ca home for New Eden\u2019s lost, broken, and abandoned\u201D.
    I wondered if he counts himself among that number. He continued, \u201CThe path
    we walk must be built by many hands and many minds. Those who have seen the failures
    of what is have been invited to build what will be.\u201D\n\n\u201CEven if it
    means the Consortium comes gunning for you?\u201D I asked, \u201CRumor is they\u2019re
    lobbying CONCORD to explode anyone caught with one of their infomorphs.\u201D\n\n\u201CMaterial
    desire has locked them into a single dimension of thought, trapped on an axis
    of rising profit. They slam the door shut, but we are already on the other side.\u201D\n\n\u201CPretty
    cryptic for one so interested in speaking the truth.\u201D\n\n\u201CI have witnessed
    much. Now, meaning must be condensed. Three worlds will not balance on the tip
    of a meat tongue.\u201D\n\n\u201CA strange message to leave the people of New
    Eden.\u201D\n\n\u201COnly a statement. My message is this; You are not safe. Though
    the air lies still, pressure builds unseen. The storm will break. When it does,
    thunderous silence will echo throughout the cluster. Be skeptical, be prudent,
    but be ready.\u201D\n\nI returned to the bright surface waters of our Jovian colossus
    only to wash up on the shores of a bottle. The more time that passed and the emptier
    that bottle became, the less certain I was that I had not dreamed the entire encounter.
    Truth is a fickle lover, and subjectivity a willing accomplice. \n\nThis will
    be my last submission from Zarzakh. Not because I am being chased out, because
    I\u2019m not. but because if a storm really is coming I need to speak with the
    people it hits, not stay cooped up in here. Maybe I\u2019ll see you there.\n\n###
