    SoCT confirms Triglavian-Drifter Conflict Amidst Calls for Capsuleer Aid\n\nYulai,
    Genesis - The SoCT has confirmed that massive energy spikes detected in Abyssal
    Deadspace are evidence of an escalating Triglavian-Drifter conflict. Observations
    of Abyssal conduits have revealed extreme levels of both the entropic energy of
    Triglavian disintegrators, and signatures unique to Drifter weaponry. \n\nThought
    anomalous when first detected, the readings are the highest ever recorded in Abyssal
    Deadspace. The SoCT's astronomical observation program was temporarily suspended
    for scientific review as a result.  No faults were found in the program\u2019s
    sensors, and the results have now been verified by both the University of Caille
    and Hedion University. \n\nAccording to these results, the quantities of energy
    being released are significant enough to cause the collapse of the conduits in
    which they are detected. Once collapsed, there is a risk of conduits appearing
    in Known Space. Idmei Sver, SoCT CEO has called this danger \u201Cextremely concerning\u201D,
    warning that \u201Cunless immediate action is taken the war between these two
    powerful forces is likely to spill over into New Eden\u201D. \n\nIn order to better
    understand and contain this threat, the SoCT is preparing plans to sponsor capsuleer
    expeditions into the collapsed conduits. EDENCOM teams will provide capsuleers
    with advanced reconnaissance, exploring conduits in hopes of gathering key operational
    intel.\n\nProvost Marshal Kasiha Valkanir issued a statement ahead of EDENCOM\u2019s
    deployment, addressing prospective capsuleer participants directly; \u201CThe
    exact nature of the conflict between these two forces is still unknown. What is
    clear is that left unchecked, their aggression will not remain limited to the
    Abyss for long. All pilots must stand against these threats before the people
    of New Eden find themselves caught in the crossfire.\u201D\n\nCapsuleer expeditions
    on behalf of the SoCT will begin on the 30th of April, YC126.\n\n### News in Brief\n\n-
    Ashes of Turnur sympathizers arrested on Caldari Prime lose appeal.\n\n- As trade
    flows uninterrupted through Mehatoor, Devoid, Empress praises crusade for suppressing
    pirate activity.\n\n- Sebiestor Tribal Chief praises Upwell for new skyhook innovation.\n\n-
    Ganortchar Asabona, CEO of Khanid Innovations, elects to self-represent in EverMore
    defamation lawsuit.\n\n- Unemployment on the rise in smaller Federation worlds,
    critics blame President sponsored AID act."
