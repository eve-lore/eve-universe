    of a Dreamer: Image courtesy of capsuleer Walter Islands*\n\n### Empress Praises
    Victors of Tash-Murkon\nTash-Murkon Prime, Tash-Murkon \u2014 Empress Catiz I
    greeted crowds at the Winter Palace of House Tash-Murkon following the first successful
    destruction of a Vigilant Dreamer in their home system. The Empress' own Royal
    House declared a region-wide day of celebration following the explosion of the
    Drifter-controlled structure by capsuleers.\n\n\u201CAlmost nine and a half years
    ago, my predecessor was assassinated by a fleet of the same profane monstrosities
    that plague our heavens once more,\u201D The Empress began, \u201CThey dared to
    try usurp our Lord\u2019s will and challenge our faith. Well, the faithful have
    risen to that challenge like a righteous flame! In these skies, as in Kobam and
    in Anath, we have proved that none can stand against us!\u201D\n\nThose gathered
    erupted in cheers. The Empress also took the time to read the honors list of pilots
    who claimed victory against the Vigilant Dreamer, awarding the newly minted \u201CTash-Murkon
    Dreambreaker Shield\u201D to the following pilots; 5kyscreamx (who struck the
    final blow), Ada May, Alicia Evelyn, Andrius Uhad, Balio Sof, Beauregard Jefferson
    III, Billsonian, CHA0S1298, chaos1298, CasperLouise, D-Apostle-17, Dabbington,
    DutchGunner, elpuffington, FaceEatingTumor, Law1127, Loregar, Plugnplay, Rimtas
    Juokas, Scootzaar Anneto, Stavri, Tokar Zeminev, Toroi Kanto, Velln Moonshatter.\n\nLord
    Tunir Tash-Murkon, heir and head of House Tash-Murkon, welcomed the empresses'
    words, adding his gratitude for the support of the other Heirs during this trying
    time. The other Royal Houses have historically held mixed sentiments towards the
    Tash-Murkon. Their Udorian heritage and pragmatic economic approach have caused
    some members of the Holder caste to join militant terrorist organizations like
    the Disciples of Purity (formerly Purity of the Throne) rather than acknowledge
    Empress Catiz Tash-Murkon I as their ruler. Today, not a single negative sentiment
    could be found in print regarding the House as people took to the streets to celebrate
    across the Empire. Lord Arim Ardishapur even went as far as to call their victory
    \u201Ca sign of divine purpose\u201D, going on to say that \u201Cin this time
    of conflict, we are blessed to have an Empress from such a resilient people.\u201D\n\n###
    First Triumphs Claimed by Caldari and Minmatar while Federation Struggles\nThe
    victory over Tash-Murkon Prime was one of eight Drifter retreats across the cluster.
    The Caldari were the first to push them back in Ichinumi, shortly followed by
    the Minmatar Republic in Geffur. Both Caldari and Amarr have claimed a total of
    three victories over Drifter forces, with the Minmatar claiming two. Despite providing
    the first warnings of the incoming Drifter attacks, the Gallente Federation has
    yet to secure a system against the invaders.\n\nChairman Akimaka Saraki has once
    again commended State forces and capsuleers alike for their successes in Ichinumi,
    Silen, and Ruvas. \u201CSwift in their response, our loyal ships were the first
    to force a Drifter retreat. A unified and disciplined response with capsuleer
    support has proven once more to be the key that unlocks triumph.\u201D Megacorporations
    Lai Dai, Sukuuvestaa, and Hyasyoda joined the chairman in his praise as their
    stations within the affected systems were able to return to business as usual.
    Saraki commented that, \u201CWhen faced with an outside threat, there are no factions,
    only Caldari.\u201D \n\nDespite their initial lack of preparation, an incredible
    effort by Minmatar forces and their capsuleer allies was more than enough to defeat
    the Drifters first in Geffur, then in Nein. Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor has cited
    these victories as \u201Cproof of the importance of tribal unity.\u201D Thukker
    Chief Ennar Aeboul who has been openly critical of the Republic\u2019s response
    declined to comment. \n\nElsewhere in the Republic, the citizens of Hadozeko were
    not so fortunate. The Command Operations system's military bases remain secure
    in their endless war with the Amarr, but many of their clans have suffered massive
    losses to the Drifters. Similar hardships were felt in the Caldari system Fuskunen,
    and all across the Federation.\n\nThe first to warn of the coming Crisis, the
    Gallente Federation has suffered most greatly as it unfolds. The systems of Hare,
    Niballe, and Gererique all experienced significant losses despite capsuleers'
    best efforts. President Celes Aguard has called once more for capsuleers to \u201Cjoin
    us in standing up for liberty. These invaders openly call themselves tyrants,
    they must not be allowed to harm our citizens. Even now they attack us once more
    in Nausschie, Ravarin, and Uphene. It is up to us to secure the future of our
    democracy, our liberty, against these aggressors.\u201D\n\n### SOCT Updates Dreamer
    Tracking as Drifters Alter Tactics\nUsing telemetry gathered during the Vigilant
    Dreamer\u2019s destruction in Tash-Murkon, the Society of Conscious Thought has
    been able to synthesize new upgrades for Crisis response fleets. Targeting computer
    modifications and improved hyperspace tracking methodologies will ensure Vigilant
    Dreamers remain available for assault as long as they are in a system. \n\nAt
    the same time, however, SOCT intel indicates that Drifters are committing to more
    persistent Vigilant Dreamer deployments. Dreamers are now expected to remain in
    system until they have completed their task or are destroyed in the attempt. This
    will mean no more retreats by Drifter forces as long as their Vigilant Dreamers
    remain operational.\n\nThe SOCT has also observed a spike in Drifter hyperspace
    communication traffic throughout the Amarr Empire simultaneous with drops in traffic
    throughout Gallente space. These changes followed the recent successes against
    the Drifters in Amarr space, along with uninterrupted streams from Drifter sites
    in Federation space.\n\n### News in Brief\n- SOCT continues to dismiss rumors
    of visions of doom as capsuleers reconstruct data captured from Drifter sites.\n\n-
    Uproar over \u201Cirresponsible\u201D Niballe mindclash tournament after fans
    disrupt evacuation efforts.\n\n- Arataka Research Consortium holds public fleets
    to stave off Drifter attacks.\n\n- The 19th Council of Stellar Management disperses
    as summit comes to an end.\n\n- High ship losses posted when Deepwater Hooligans
    and allies faced off against Shadow Cartel in Alachene."
