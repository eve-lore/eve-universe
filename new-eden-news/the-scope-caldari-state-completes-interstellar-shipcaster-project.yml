    State Interstellar Shipcaster Completed and Operational in Onnamon\n\nOnnamon,
    Black Rise \u2013 The Caldari State has completed the construction of a working
    Interstellar Shipcaster in the Onnamon system, following a high-intensity campaign
    by Caldari loyalist capsuleers to acquire the necessary Triglavian data and construct
    advanced infrastructure combining Caldari research into a newly-developed transport
    technology.\n\nThe Caldari State's completion of the State Interstellar Shipcaster
    project in Onnamon system places a valuable strategic asset in the militia warzone
    HQ system of the State military. The Interstellar Shipcaster is capable of projecting
    forces to up to three destination beacons located in the Caldari-Gallente militia
    warzone, with Caldari Navy command designating locations for construction according
    to strategic priorities.\n\nThe achievement is a major victory for Caldari State
    Protectorate militia capsuleers. The efforts of Caldari loyalist capsuleers were
    critical to the program to acquire Triglavian stellar technology by any means
    necessary, and combine it with the State's grasp of Triglavian transport relay
    technology to produce the Interstellar Shipcaster.\n\nThe Caldari State lead in
    acquiring Triglavian technologies, and developing them into a strategic network
    of installations, can be traced back to the \"Serthoulde Campaign\" in which the
    State successfully maintained control of the Athounon system. The State's access
    to Triglavian transport relay facilities hidden in Athounon and the Serthoulde
    constellation gave them a key head-start. This control and the construction of
    a new stargate connection between Athounon and the Caldari industrial system of
    Samanuni was also due to the dedicated efforts of Caldari State capsuleers.\n\nCaldari
    Navy Executive General Heika Torigo expressed her congratulations to Caldari militia
    capsuleers, hailing their achievement as, \"a shining example of the indomitable
    spirit of the Caldari Way.\" General Torigo was joined in this by Chairman Akimaka
    Saraki of the Caldari Chief Executive Panel. Chairman Saraki declared: \"No other
    people can match the resolute determination and unwavering dedication of the Caldari.
    Today we have seen this demonstrated in full by our State Protectorate capsuleers
    and many other loyal citizens of the State.\"\n\n![state stellar transmuter op](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/3yFTFQOCPjyxl71k5Nz1Ao/62ececd57cd592ea4b1198db04c05049/state_stellar_transmuter_op.png)

    Network Brings Stellar Transmuter Fully Online in Elonaya System\n\nElonaya, Lonetrek
    \u2013 The completion of the State Interstellar Shipcaster, and deployment of
    its network of beacon constructors across the Caldari-Gallente warzone, has also
    brought online the new Caldari Stellar Transmuter in orbit of the Elonaya system's
    central blue A0 star. Caldari authorities have been quick to emphasize the State
    Stellar Transmuter is a \"mature technology\" and that State scientists and engineers
    have a \"clear understanding of the operating limits of the new stellar transmuter
    installation in Elonaya.\"\n\nDespite these assurances some among the population
    of Elonaya have expressed misgivings at the sight of the Stellar Transmuter interacting
    with the system's star. A relatively small system clustered around the small blue
    sun, Elonaya's innermost barren planets are largely the domain of automated mining
    and smelting operations, together with experimental stations and heavily protected
    underground barracks. Most workers rotate from the most heavily-populated planet,
    the temperate world of Elonaya VIII.\n\nOrbiting 2.33 AU from the central star,
    Elonaya VIII is considered an ideal colonial world, with a wide band of easily
    inhabited and exploitable terrain on its surface of continents and oceans. The
    large arcologies on Elonaya VIII are by far the greatest centers of population
    in the system and are the permanent home of most workers on the industrialized
    inner barren and lava planets, and the orbitals of the outer gas planets. A certain
    amount of public protest and disruption has been reported in some of these arcologies
    with megacorporation administrators attributing this to \"malcontents and anarchists.\"\n\nThe
    majority of space-industrial interests are focused on the orbital system of Elonaya
    X, with its mineral-rich moons and convenient access to chemical products of the
    outer gas planets. Megacorporations such as CBD and Lai Dai are known to have
    little tolerance for dissent, making it all the more notable that protests have
    taken place. In addition, citizen worker representative councils authorized by
    other megacorps with a presence on Elonaya VIII, such as Kaalakiota and Sukuuvestaa,
    have reportedly featured persistent questions to executive administators as to
    the Stellar Transmuter's impact on the system.\n\n![beacon renarelle op](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/4ddj0Enhj5LRb0e5lbAZ04/80cc734487766e5de4a528ef6d852413/beacon_renarelle_op.png)
