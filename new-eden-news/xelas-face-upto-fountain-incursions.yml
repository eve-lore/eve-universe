- body: "FOUNTAIN - Xelas Alliance were thrust into the firing line of the Band of
    Brothers versus Ascendant Frontier conflict last fortnight and found themselves
    facing challenges brought by new enemies and changes to old relationships.  \nHowever,
    having endured consistent pressure for some considerable time, claims of their
    demise appeared premature. \n\nJust two days prior to the outbreak of hostilities
    Xelas was hampered by the loss of over 300 pod-pilots as a breakaway alliance
    named Horde split from the original group, led by the Dark Rising and NOPHEX corporations.
    \n\nWith a degree of tension between allies in effect the last thing required
    was a capital fleet arriving but this is what occurred when the PNQY-Y system
    was invaded. \n\nJaveir, CEO of Shadows of the Dead Corporation explained: \u201CWe
    joined Xelas four weeks ago. In that time we've lost 300 of Xelas's best pilots,
    Celestial Apocalypse has formed the Insurgency, and they called on ASCN to bring
    its dread fleet over.\u201D \n\nThe Shadows of the Dead CEO added: \u201CASCN
    didn't get much resistance; we're not strong enough to fight 20 dreads head on.
    Insurgency had good timing, they are good fighters. Horde made a pre-tense of
    helping us, but it was more symbolic than anything else.\u201D \n\nVirtuozzo,
    a member of ASCN high command commented on the tactical thinking behind the attack:
    \u201CXelas is just in the way of the bigger objectives in the war. Xelas, when
    signing on with BOB were aware of the long-term potential risk of BOB getting
    into a war with a faction who would bring the war to BOB space.\u201D \n\nThe
    eXceed Inc. pilot added: \u201CIt's a calculated risk, so I am sure Xelas planned
    for this. But reality is as it is, when you are a part of such an (economic) model,
    you should realise that there is an intrinsic risk involved. War after all is
    what reigns in deep space.\u201D \n\nWhen asked about ASCN\u2019s assault on PNQY-Y,
    Shrike of BoB commented: \u201CIt seems like a good way to avoid fighting us.
    They stand to gain absolutely nothing by that move, and are infact due to it,
    losing Paragon Soul as we speak. The only thing ASCN gain is more enemies.\u201D
    \n\nWith BoB attacking Paragon Soul, Shrike was confident that Xelas would be
    able to deal with any more future incursions into their space. \n\nShe said: \u201CASCN
    has issued a full scale retreat to try and deal with us taking Paragon. Without
    ASCN there, who will stop Xelas from taking it back fulltime? Xelas might not
    seem mighty on the paper, but they have withstood almost one full year of constant
    war, and I do not think ASCN thought about this.\u201D \n\nJaveir, the Xelas representative
    confirmed this, stating: \u201CThe alliance is doing fine at the moment. We don't
    need stations to survive in Fountain. The SOD Fast Action Response Team has performed
    amazingly well and will deal with any more threats that come here.\u201D \n\nIn
    a statement made on the GalNet on Tuesday, Blue Flame of Xelas announced that
    his alliance had successfully regained control of the PNQY-Y system. ASCN has
    reportedly withdrawn from the Fountain region as the conflict with BoB intensifies
    in the South."
