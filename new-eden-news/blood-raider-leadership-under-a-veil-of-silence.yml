    world following their mass scale collection of body parts in recent days. Omir
    Sarikusa has ordered all his top lieutenants to stay with him at his secret hideout
    deep in Blood Raider space, as the last steps are taken to complete preparations
    for his scheme involving the body parts. He does this to make sure that no information
    regarding this scheme leaks out too early. Though the Blood Raiders sustained
    heavy losses from fellow collectors, the Blood Raider elite is upbeat about the
    future, believing that great things lie ahead for them.   \n  \nWhile many idly
    speculate what evil plans Sarikusa is hatching, DED doesn\u2019t have the luxury
    to take this lightly and is sending scouting parties into Blood Raider space trying
    to find Sarikusa\u2019s hidden citadel. Time is running out and DED officials
    have indicated that all possible avenues are being exploited to thwart Sarikusa
    and his comrades in crime."
