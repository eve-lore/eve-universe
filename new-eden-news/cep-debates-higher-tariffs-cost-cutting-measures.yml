- body: "New Caldari \u2013 The current fragility of the Caldari economy was front
    and center in the most recent session of the Chief Executive Panel, with a number
    of representatives voicing concerns that funding for State-wide programs was sapping
    resources needed by the megacorporations to deal with their own financial problems.
    The overall feeling of the Panel was summed up in a statement by the Nugoeihuvi
    delegation: \u201CThe time has come for us to remember that business is our priority,
    and all other concerns are secondary; we must aim for the best return for every
    kredit invested if we are to continue to prosper in this environment.\u201D \n\nHowever,
    while the Panel seemed to have a consensus as to the problem, there seemed to
    be considerable disagreement as to the solution. Of the many suggestions for how
    to rejuvenate the economy, two seem to have gained traction; one, advanced by
    the Kaalakiota delegation, has been the increase of tariffs on imports into the
    State, while the second, advanced by the Nugoeihuvi delegation, is a reduction
    in the budgets of the both the Caldari Navy and the Caldari Business Tribunal.
    Both suggestions spurred contentious debate during the session, and the issue
    has spilled over into other discussions as well, most notably during the session
    that was supposed to be devoted to dealing with the attempted assassination of
    Amarr Court Chamberlain Karsoth. \n\nAdvancing the plan for higher tariffs, the
    Kaalakiota delegation blamed much of the State's economic woes on inferior quality
    goods flooding Caldari markets. \u201CThe fact of the matter is that the Federation,
    Republic, and the Empire have an advantage in terms of labor cost; how can we
    compete with goods assembled by poorly-paid migrant workers, sweatshops, and slaves?
    The State cannot simply solve its problems by throwing more people at them, unfortunately.
    We must make our goods competitive until the economy stabilizes.\u201D The corporation
    called for an increase of import tariffs on most raw materials, foodstuffs, textiles,
    and other low tech goods where the megacorporations have been least competitive
    with foreign imports. \n\nReaction in the Panel was mixed; though support was
    strong from Wiyrkomi, Sukuuvestaa, and Nugoeihuvi, the Ishukone delegation blasted
    the proposal as \u201Cprotectionism\u201D that was \u201Ca tiny bandage on a sucking
    chest wound.\u201D \u201CReducing the impetus to compete cluster-wide will only
    create further doubt in the market when that is exactly what we should be trying
    to avoid. Perhaps if certain corporations spent more time reducing their own inefficiencies
    instead of blaming it on someone else, we would not be in this situation in the
    first place,\u201D said one Ishukone delegate. Ishukone's statements were seconded
    by the Hyasyoda delegation, and received muted applause from both Lai Dai and
    the CBD Corporation as well. No decision has yet been made, although the plan
    does appear to have barely enough support to become law should Kaalakiota push
    the matter. \n\nMeanwhile, in the same session, Nugoeihuvi advanced a proposal
    to trim the budget for both the Caldari Navy and the Caldari Business Tribunal
    by nearly 15%. \u201CWhile the defense of the State must be a high priority, the
    economic strength of our corporations cannot be threatened by paying billions
    of ISK to fund expansion of a military force already sufficient to defend our
    current interests,\u201D said the Nugoeihuvi statement. \u201CThough important,
    military expenditures are not an investment, they are overhead, and we all know
    that overhead must be the first thing trimmed whenever a budget is reevaluated.
    Meanwhile, we have seen an increasing number of Tribunal investigations end with
    no charges brought and no damages assessed; perhaps cutting their budget will
    convince them to engage in fewer frivolous investigations and concentrate on those
    of more weight.\u201D \n\nOnce again, this proposal was not greeted quietly in
    the halls of the Panel. \u201CCutting the budget for the Navy at this time, so
    soon after such obvious Gallente provocations as the Kassigainen incident and
    the so-called 'Brothers of Freedom' is not only ill-advised, it is criminal,\u201D
    refuted the Wiyrkomi delegation. \n\n\u201CIs it a coincidence that Nugoeihuvi,
    which has been the target of 17% of the Tribunal's investigations this year, is
    calling for a reduction in their budget? Somehow I doubt that very much,\u201D
    commented a member of the Lai Dai delegation. Still, despite resistance from the
    Patriot corporations and some resistance by Ishukone, a major Navy contractor,
    the measure seemed to find some support among the other Panel members, placing
    it in a similar position to the tariff measure. \n\nThough officially, neither
    the Navy or the Tribunal have any comment on political matters, it is clear that
    many within the ranks of both organizations find the prospect of reduced budgets
    a disturbing one. \u201CIt seems to me it would be better if the pencil pushers
    in New Caldari left the judgement of what was 'necessary' to the military instead
    of telling us we don't need things,\u201Dsaid one Navy captain that asked not
    to be identified. \n\nIn the Tribunal, many are concerned that a reduction in
    their budget will only worsen intercorporate strife while at the same time handicapping
    the Tribunal's ability to act as a firebreak on open warfare. \u201CTension between
    the various megas is the highest I've seen it in my 17 years here,\u201D said
    one member of the Tribunal's legal department. \u201CShorting our budget could
    have serious consequences in keeping megacorporate hostilities at an acceptable
    level.\u201D \n\nPerhaps most telling about both of these initiatives is that
    five or ten years ago, such measures would both have little if any support among
    most of the Panel members. \u201CEver since the end of the war, the Navy's budget
    has been almost sacrosanct,\u201D said Amaari Karnuras, professor of political
    and memetic science at the School of Applied Knowledge. \u201CAnd Kaalakiota's
    assertion that labor costs are higher in the State is shaky at best; the State
    continually looks towards more automation, which is comparatively cheap to maintain.
    The fact that these measures seem to be getting more traction now is a sign that
    the Panel is at least privately of the opinion that the economy is not nearly
    as strong as it once was.\u201D"
