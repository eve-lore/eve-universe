- body: "As the space industry expands and becomes a more integral part of the economy
    of EVE, more and more people are becoming aware of the heroes and villains that
    ply the vast inter-stellar trade routes. Some of the pirate factions are now established
    enough that they are known by the majority of the populace. Consequentially, the
    leaders of these nefarious organizations are becoming known to the world at large,
    often through dramatized holo-reels based more on fiction than fact.   \n  \nThe
    branch within CONCORD responsible for dealing with pirates, DED, is becoming increasingly
    worried over the apparent hero-worship displayed by ordinary citizens towards
    notorious pirates. The best known case is that of Fatal and the Rabbit, whose
    stunning exploits against the Caldari State and Gallente Federation are already
    stuff of legend. But other infamous pirates are also getting unwarranted, in the
    eyes DED, adulation from the public. The pirates have started taking more risks,
    increasing their exposure in reckless and daring endeavors.   \n  \nTo counter
    this, DED has started compiling a most-wanted list, hoping that this will put
    so much heat on those on the list that they'll scurry back into the shadows. Though
    the list has not yet been made public, several names have already been mentioned
    that will undoubtedly be on it. This includes Tobias Kruzhor, aka Raze, the right
    hand man of the leader of the Dominations; the traitor Brynn Jerdola of the Serpentis
    and the sociopath Draclira Merlonne of the Blood Raiders. DED officials have confirmed
    that the list will be updated frequently, and though it will initially consist
    of pilots from the established pirate factions, it may eventually also include
    people from more recent pirate groups."
