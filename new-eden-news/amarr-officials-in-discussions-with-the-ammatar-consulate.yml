- body: A high ranking Amarr official is expected to arrive in Ammatar space later
    today carrying plans for an Ammatar offensive against the Minmatars. This is the
    first indication that the Amarrians are taking steps to respond against the increasing
    Minmatar incursions into their space. While the details of the plans are not known
    it is expected that they involve information about known Minmatar rebels, their
    bases and defences. In the hands of the warlike Ammatars this information might
    deal a heavy blow to the rebels, which they might never recover from.
