    large scale buy up of goods in the Caldari territories by the Galactic Trading
    and Logistics Corporation.   \n  \nThe rumours, which centre on the notoriously
    busy trade systems of Jita and Nonni have sparked considerable interest and conjecture
    from local vendors as to the source of the rumours as well as the contents and
    purpose of such an unusually large buy up. A trader responded that it is impossible
    to predict sales on hearsay and rumours and said he would not let it influence
    his normal business routine.   \n  \nJashira Ne\xB4rgha \u2013 CEO of GTAL previously
    astonished merchants in The Forge and Lonetrek with similar trade requests for
    large quantities of contraband items and minerals in early December last year.
    \  \n  \nNe\xB4rgha was unavailable to comment on the validity of the rumours."
