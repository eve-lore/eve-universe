    open to any and all capsuleers who fly interceptors, frigates or assault frigates.
    They are now into their fifth season and have been going from strength to strength.
    \n\nThe first race of Season V took place on Sunday 30th March and what a race
    it turned out to be. The [usual suspects](http://www.pleasure-hub.com/isgc/viewforum.php?f=22)
    were on the starting line along with some racers who are new to the league this
    season. Side bets and pots for the different classes were being arranged and the
    atmosphere was similar to an old dirtside carnival and just as colourful, with
    the racers sporting their teams or sponsors colours during the preflight ceremonies;
    Ezekiel Sulastin was seen to be wearing a white and green CreoDron-branded interface
    suit, whilst Jason Nightwing came sporting a red and black interface suit with
    gold trim, but no matter what colour a racers suit was or what team they pilot
    for, the camaraderie was amazing and universal. \n\nGyra Rho, ISGC Racing League
    Official and course designer, started the race shortly after 20:00 and all the
    pilots instantly started undocking from the Quafe Company Factory near Arant V
    to make their way to the Parts system, the first waypoint in the race. There were
    fifteen waypoints in the race taking the pilots through both high and low security
    systems. The low security systems were riddled with pirates and during the race
    three capsuleers lost their ships, the first two ships were lost in the Aeschee
    system to a group of pirates from Triumvirate. and Serpentis and the third was
    lost in the Brarel system to another group of Serpentis pirates. The three capsuleers
    who lost their ships, Nyabinghi, demon flir and Deathlords were overheard saying
    that they would be back for race two of the season. \n\nThirty capsuleers started
    the race flying frigates, interceptors and assault frigates and for a majority
    of the race they were racing neck to neck, in the league's recorded history this
    is the first time that so many racers flew in a cluster for so much of the course.
    The final three waypoints were the deciding factor and in the end it was the veteran
    pilot's experience of slingshotting around the marker cans that gave them the
    lead they needed to win. \n\n* * *\n\nThe official results were posted on [GalNet](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=730917)
