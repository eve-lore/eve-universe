    Warnings Raised Over Drifter Wormhole Experiments\nThe Anoikis Mapping Project
    (AMP), a capsuleer-led initiative working with the Gallente Federation, has raised
    concerns over the experiments being carried out in occupied Drifter Wormholes.
    According to AMP, the occupiers' destructive testing of the Drifter\u2019s hyperspace
    network threatens to destabilize New Eden.\n\nThe Anoikis Mapping Project is dedicated
    to the simultaneous monitoring of every single system in Anoikis, also known as
    Wormhole Space. AMP is reporting increasingly erratic hyperspace telemetry readings
    inside the Drifter Wormhole systems. They have published findings that suggest
    that if the current testing continues unabated, it may have unpredictable and
    disastrous long-term effects all across New Eden.\n\nFive factions occupied Drifter
    Wormhole systems after successfully pushing back the Drifters during last year's
    Drifter Crisis. These factions are the Amarr Empire, the Caldari State, EDENCOM,
    the Minmatar Republic, and the Triglavian Collective. Since the end of the Crisis,
    they have been experimenting on the Drifter artifacts within each system, most
    notably the massive pillar formations that were the nexus points of Drifter activity
    during the Crisis' final stages. \n\nThe exact nature of their research remains
    top secret, but it is known that the Drifter\u2019s hyperspace network has been
    a key focus for all five wormhole occupiers. Their intensive testing of the network
    is in line with the suggestions of the Drifter Wormhole Summit held in Jita 4.4
    last year, at which delegates from all five occupying factions promoted destructive
    testing of the network.\n\nThe AMP\u2019s founder and patron, Rhysio Typho, has
    stated that they are \u201Cgrowing ever more concerned that those effects might
    spill over to known space\u201D. Her concern has, however, been met with suspicion
    by the five occupying factions. Chairman Akimaka Saraki of the Caldari State went
    as far as to accuse the AMP of being a puppet of the Gallente President Aguard\u2019s
    \u201Cfailing administration, which is desperate to regain face after its failures
    in the Race for the Hives.\u201D Rhysio Typho has responded with a willingness
    to share data with any who \u201Cpause their hyperspace network experiments immediately.\u201D\n\nMeanwhile,
    first signs have begun to emerge of practical applications for the research being
    carried out by occupying forces. Upwell, who have partnered with EDENCOM to assist
    in their research within the system of Sentinel MZ, have reported that breakthroughs
    are being made and they hope to showcase developments in the near future.\n\n###
