- body: '**Villore -** Earlier today Gallentean President Souro Foiritan announced
    the formation of a secretive new department within the FIO, empowered with oversight
    of the entire Federation. Officially titled the "Special Department of Internal
    Investigations and Federal Security," the new branch will be led by Gallente Head
    Senator Mentas Blaque.


    Currently in Villore to attend a series of high-level meetings with various political
    officials, the President delivered his brief announcement against a giant backdrop
    of the department''s logo; a black eagle reminiscent of the national icon.


    He described the new body as an "ever-watchful eye" that would be "entitled to
    take any means necessary...to ensure integrity is maintained throughout every
    branch of Federation government." Although light on details, President Foiritan
    did state that finding rogue Admiral Anvent Eturrer was one of the branch''s first
    directives, alongside a more general order to tighten up internal security and
    root out corruption.


    Many were surprised by the formation of the new department, claiming it showed
    a change in the President''s usually hands-off approach to matters of internal
    security. "It''s normally something he would leave to the military commanders
    and FIO leadership," said security analyst Piel Bursch, "but when it is those
    same people you want to keep an eye on, things naturally have to change." Others
    were less surprised, pointing to recent public demands for a department similar
    to the one established today.


    For his own part, the President distanced his announcement from the latest public
    outcries, stating that the formation of the Black Eagles, as they are quickly
    becoming known, had been a "long time coming". He added that recent public displays
    such as the Citizen''s Summit only reinforced his commitment to the idea and served
    as "just one of many reasons" why his decision was both the right one and worthy
    of a popular mandate.'
