- body: "Khifomek Mareyi, a member of the Amarr Trade Registry, was killed late last
    night moving a shipment of Vitoc from Asrios to Amarr. Also thought to be related
    to this incident, two bodies were discovered in Emrayur having died from Vitoc
    withdrawal. These bodies have been confirmed as two of the escaped gladiators
    belonging to the now deceased slave-holder, Bamadak Pareh.  \n  \nMareyi was killed
    when a group of Matari freedom fighters ambushed her and her pod-pilot escort
    somewhere in the Youl system. The Impel pilot had recruited an escort earlier,
    having heard reports of a marauding gang of gladiators hanging around the Emrayur
    system. Unfortunately, they were ill-equipped to handle the Matari ambush and
    both ship and cargo were lost.  \n  \nIt appears that the gladiators were hoping
    to ambush the Vitoc convoy to fulfil their needs. Unable to acquire the drug,
    two of those addicted fell victim to vitoc withdrawal and, ultimately, a very
    painful death.  \n  \nThese rogue gladiators are desperate to survive, though
    their motivation is still a great mystery. Tilkk Hettad, a Nefantar and senior
    professor at the Royal Amarr Institute school where the bodies were found, commented
    as follows.  \n  \n\"These freedom fighters think they're fighting for the good
    of all Minmatar, but tonight they were the cause of two deaths. Right now I can't
    decide whether they're good guys or bad guys.\""
