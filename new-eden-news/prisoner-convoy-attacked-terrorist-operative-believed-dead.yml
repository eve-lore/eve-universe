- body: "At approximately 18:30 EVT last night, a convoy carrying noted UDI operative
    Goran Mitelek was attacked in the Ebo system en route to the Avair Theology Council
    Tribunal. The assailants, a squadron of interceptors and missile frigates flying
    under EW cruiser support, had apparently entered the system through the Esteban
    gate, proceeding to ambush the prison convoy with mobile warp disruptors at the
    gate to Avair.   \n  \nDetails of the engagement are sketchy at present, but two
    Imperial Navy support frigates who managed to effect a retreat from the battle,
    severely damaged, reported the destruction of at least twelve ships from both
    sides, including most of the attacking force. Inspection of on-site debris later
    revealed that the transport Mitelek was travelling in had succumbed to missile
    fire, scattered bits of debris and unidentifiable biomass being all that remained.
    \  \n  \nAs of yet no leads have been brought to light as to who is behind the
    attack, but internal as well as external investigations have reportedly begun
    within both the Civic Court and the Theology Council. Mervan Moritok, Arch Deacon
    of the Theology Council, released a statement just after noon today expressing
    the Council\u2019s condemnation of the brutal attack and stating that perpetrators
    of terrorism within the Holy Empire would be brought to \u201Cthe swiftest, harshest
    justice.\u201D Since this morning, many ships traveling within the Liela constellation
    have been stopped and scanned by Imperial Navy vessels and extensive investigations
    are underway on the constellation\u2019s planets and stations.   \n  \nIn all
    this, however, one curious detail remains unaccounted for. Security footage from
    the prison transport, relayed in real-time to the TC Tribunal station in Avair,
    appears to indicate that just after the attack commenced some internal struggle
    may have taken place on the transport itself. The footage, taken from a camera
    in one of the ship\u2019s anterior passageways, depicts a Navy guard throwing
    himself at another guard with what can easily be taken to be aggressive intent.
    Amarr officials, meanwhile, have adamantly denied all such claims, stating that
    the ship was obviously under fire at time of recording, and that the hull-breached
    vessel\u2019s shaking and systems failure account for the widespread misreading
    of the guard\u2019s actions.   \n  \nMitelek, long-time transstellar arms dealer
    and operative of extremist ideological faction United against Decadence and Impurity,
    was believed to have been one of the persons orchestrating the attack against
    the Rent-A-Dream Pleasure Gardens complex in Elarel last March, an incident now
    known as \u201CThe Elarel massacre.\u201D He was subsequently captured and held
    by the Gallente Federation before his surprise extradition to the Amarr Empire
    last month."
