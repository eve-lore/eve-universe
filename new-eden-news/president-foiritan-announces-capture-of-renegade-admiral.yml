- body: "Luminaire - President Foiritan addressed the Gallente Federation today in
    the wake of the Federation Navy's first instance of direct military action within
    the Amarr Empire's borders in over three decades.\n\n\"In response to intelligence
    received yesterday, this morning I authorized our military forces to cross the
    border into the Amarr Empire and conduct a forced extraction of the traitor, former
    Grand Admiral of the Navy, Anvent Eturrer,\" said the President, speaking to an
    assembled crowd of thousands.\n\n\"The force encountered some resistance, which
    it summarily overcame. I am glad to report to you that the promise I made five
    months ago has been fulfilled.  We have found the traitor and we hold him in our
    talons. Anvent Eturrer is now being kept at a secret maximum security facility
    where he awaits trial for his crimes against the Federation.\" \n\nThough no date
    has been set for the trial, nor it decided what exact form the proceedings will
    take, the President went to great lengths to assure the nation of Eturrer's fate.\n\n\"I
    promised you he would atone for his crimes... that he would stand judgment, be
    made to pay for what he cost this Federation. Citizens of the Federation, I promise
    you this -- he will pay.\"\n\n\"With this extraction effected, and the Kador forces
    that chose to strike out against us dissolved, we are satisfied that no further
    action will be needed against the Amarr Empire at this time,\" the President also
    said.\n\nAmarr authorities have so far remained silent about the situation. According
    to Gallente officials no high-level communication has taken place between the
    two governments, and no apparent mobilization has taken place among the Amarr
    armed forces."
