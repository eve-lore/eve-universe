    Mothership FNS - Wandering Saint set a collision course into the Ishukone Headquarters
    killing hundreds of thousands, including Ishukone's CEO Otro Gariushi. This event
    caused the dark unstable political landscape we see today.\"   \n  \nJohn opened
    up the event with a speech, in which he spoke of those who lost their lives: \"May
    we respect the memories of the fallen, and we will never forget what they stood
    for.\"   \n  \nThe second speaker, Varlerian Ti'kihli, paid his respects to Otro
    and spoke of the unity within New Eden at the event. \"Right now, every single
    one of you - Amarr, Caldari, Minmatar, Gallente - are one; we are one. We gather
    here under one purpose... to honour and remember those who were killed on that
    fateful day three years ago.\"   \n  \nSchlaba Muhos, final speaker, concluded
    the event by summarising what the event is all about while also extending thanks
    to capsuleers who attended the event: \"We send thanks to everyone for showing
    respect during the memorial regardless of political ties or beliefs, we hope that
    with this the cluster will learn from the mistakes of the past.\"\n\n### GalNet
