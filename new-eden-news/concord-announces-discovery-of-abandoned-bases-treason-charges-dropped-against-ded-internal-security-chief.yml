    Kakkichi for his unauthorized expedition into unregulated space, CONCORD released
    a public statement announcing the discovery of dozens of uncharted, abandoned
    stations in deep space. According to their statement, the Commander played an
    \u201Cinstrumental\u201D role in the discovery of these hidden outposts, though
    the exact details surrounding his initial decision to bypass the DED chain of
    command about their discovery remains unclear. There is little known of the original
    owners of the bases or why they were constructed, and an investigation is well
    underway.   \n  \nThe following text is the official press release from CONCORD:
    _  \n  \n\u201CApproximately one week ago, CONCORD learned of the existence of
    dozens of abandoned stations in deep space. As of this moment, CONCORD reconnaissance
    elements have confirmed the locations of exactly 69 outposts in 23 regions outside
    of Empire borders. These stations have been deserted for some time and were constructed
    20 or more years ago by a mysterious organization that called themselves \u2018Immensea\u2019,
    presumably after the first region they settled in. There are no known affiliates
    or personnel alive today who are associated with this group that we are aware
    of, and efforts are underway to locate individuals who may have some insight on
    what exactly caused their disappearance. What we do know for certain is that the
    Immensea went to great lengths to hide their existence, and at one time possessed
    enormous wealth and influence.\u201D  \n  \n\u201CEvery station we found has severe
    internal structural damage that appears to have been inflicted by the original
    inhabitants. The data cores on each of these bases are permanently damaged and
    barely able to manage crucial systems such as power grids and life support. We
    did not find a single station with more than one functional module onboard. In
    some cases, entire sections of the inoperable modules were observed venting directly
    into space. Shields are still online at each station, but no sentry guns or other
    point-defense systems were encountered. Automated harbor control will reject all
    docking requests until the shields are disabled and the station\u2019s online
    authentication systems are reset from the inside.\u201D   \n  \n\u201CBecause
    these stations lie beyond the jurisdiction of CONCORD and cannot legally be claimed
    by any sovereignty with representatives in the Assembly, they are free to anyone
    with the resources required to take them. We are hopeful that this unexpected
    expansion of deep space platforms will create new economic opportunities for our
    citizens and revitalize commerce between unregulated and empire-controlled space.\u201D
    \  \n  \n\u201CCommander Kakkichi was instrumental in the discovery of these abandoned
    bases and had legitimate reasons for withholding that information from his superiors
    until he was personally able to verify it. As such, the treason and unjustifiable
    use of government property charges have been dropped. However, the charge of disobeying
    a direct order from a superior officer still stands. CONCORD is a functional,
    effective law enforcement agency specifically because of our established chain
    of command, and we do not tolerate breaches of that protocol. Commander Kakkichi
    has pleaded guilty to this charge in exchange for the unconditional pardon of
    the officers under his command during his unauthorized journey to deep space.
    However, in light of the circumstances and the brave conduct displayed by the
    Commander throughout the course of his ordeal, his sentence will be reduced to
    a temporary demotion in rank, effective immediately.\u201D   \n  \n\u201CDED stellar
    cartographers are currently working to plot station locations as our scouts return
    from deep space with the required navigational information. Once all coordinate
    information has been retrieved, we will upload the data to the primary CONCORD
    Navigational Services World Map database for public use. Further information will
    be released as it becomes available. Estimated time of full public release is
    within the next 24 hours.\u201D _  \n  \nCommander Kakkichi and his lawyer Dantennen
    Fisk are still under gag order restrictions and thus unavailable for comment."
