- body: "Malkalen \u2013 The Ishukone Corporation Board of Directors agreed to grant
    strategic control of industrial operations to Tibus Heth, joining the rest of
    the mega-corporations in their partnership with the Caldari Providence Directorate.
    Ishukone employees, still mourning the loss of Otro Gariushi and the hundreds
    of thousands who also perished in the Malkalen disaster, overwhelmingly support
    the measure. \n\nThe board also announced that an active search is underway to
    appoint a new CEO. Chief Financial Officer Kinachi Hepimeki, considered the most
    qualified candidate, has reportedly resigned, citing personal reasons linked to
    the disaster. She and the late Mr. Gariushi are credited with running the most
    financially-sound mega-corporation in the Caldari State. Ralirashi Okimo, current
    head of the manufacturing division, is now considered the most likely replacement.
    \n\nMarkets are responding favorably to the news. Ishukone shares lost nearly
    20% of their value following the Malkalen disaster, which forced the mega-corporation
    to cease industrial operations for a full week. Mr. Heth, known for his fiery
    anti-Gallentean rhetoric, has demonstrated considerable leadership qualities in
    corporate affairs that Caldari executives are keen to work with. The reinvigoration
    of workforce morale and subsequent revitalization of industrial efforts is largely
    attributed to Heth\u2019s alignment of mega-corporate interests under the Caldari
    Providence Directorate. Some analysts speculate that the beleaguered Caldari State
    economy may have already bottomed out, with local currencies stabilizing versus
    the ISK and State index shares rebounding slightly from all-time lows."
