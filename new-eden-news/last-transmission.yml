- body: "**Querious**. Sources inside Hedion University have revealed that one of
    their research scout ships, the Celestial, has disapeared under mysterious circumstances
    inside the Querious region. Consisting of contested nullsec space, the ship was
    apparently searching within the area for solar anomalies and uncharted nebulai.
    \n\nWhat little is known of the disappearance has been gleaned from the last data
    transmission received. Unfortunately some of the data was corrupted beyond recognition,
    however portions of the logs have been recovered. \n\nWhat follows is an excerpt
    from the official transcript of the captain Ethan Ramual.  \n_\"....impossible
    situat......power to the...fluctuating.......attempts to rectify failed.....ance
    not operable.....of a labyrinth, unable to get beari.....i repeat mayd......vigation
    systems failed, guidance not.......\"._  \nThis is the last transmission. \n\nThe
    university has sent further ships to the area, starting with their last known
    position in the system named 8-SNUD. No sign of the ship has yet been found. The
    theory at the moment is that the ship encountered an anomaly which destabilised
    or damaged the navigation and power systems. With no way to navigate or communicate,
    the ship would be adrift in space reliant on crew members abilities to estimate
    correct spacial orientation. \n\nSources have told us that the search area will
    expand, unofficially there is some concern that the stricken ship may have made
    it into the Catch region which would present an infeasibly large search area.
    \n\nThe search continues in the hope that they will be found or that the Celestial
    finds its way back to familiar territories."
