- body: "Breaking news from the Aeman constellation: Over the last hour, reports have
    been filtering in that the Guristas attack force stationed in Rancer has begun
    relocating to Miroitem, an adjacent system. Additionally, rumors of notorious
    Gurista leader Jirai \u201CFatal\u201D Laitanen\u2019s presence in the Thelan
    system have caused widespread unease among the system\u2019s inhabitants.  \n
    \ \nAs of yet none of the sightings have been confirmed, but Thelan\u2019s Local
    Bureau of Transportation has reported a slightly less than twofold increase in
    stargate traffic out of the system over the last three hours. CONCORD and Federation
    Navy units are reportedly on standby, but officials are unavailable for comment
    at this time. More news on this as it arrives."
