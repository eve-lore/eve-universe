- body: "A local slaveholder was found dead on Friday at his home in the Amarr system
    under mysterious circumstances.   \n  \nThe man, Rezini Lifu, whose body had been
    mutilated, was found by a close friend after failing to attend a meeting. Several
    items of his property were also discovered missing including all of his slaves
    and large number of combat ready vessels, a full list has not been disclosed.
    \  \n  \nLifu, who did not have a clone at the time of his death, was described
    by one source as a \u2018sadistic individual\u2019 who treated his slaves as \u2018little
    more than animals\u2019.   \n  \nHe is believed to have recently become involved
    in an underground Gladiatorial arena within Amarrian society after acquiring an
    undisclosed number of slaves from the widow of a recently deceased holder.   \n
    \ \nApparently seeing the Gladiatorial sport as an opportunity to elevate his
    status within Amarrian society, Lifu is said to have invested heavily in equipping
    his Gladiator slaves, who are also listed among his missing property.   \n  \nThe
    ancient blood sport, which pits combatants against each other in a dual to the
    death for the entertainment of others, has been rekindled by a group of lesser
    nobles within Amarrian society. The dusty arena and melee weapons of old have
    however, been substituted for a small sector of space and powerful combat craft.
    \  \n  \nTraditionally these highly prized slaves, known as Gladiators, are treated
    exceptionally well and provided with privileges far in excess of anything their
    slave counterparts might hope for from their masters. After a time those Gladiators
    in high favour of their masters may even be given a chance to earn their freedom,
    usually being absorbed into the Amarrian way of life and becoming body guards
    or Gladiator trainers for the elite, such cases are however, very rare."
