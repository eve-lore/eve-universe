- body: "Gyt Quisog, the Jovian official supervising the collection of the body parts
    of Misu Baniya, announced during a session in the Inner Circle of CONCORD yesterday
    that enough body parts had been collected for a reconstruction of the unfortunate
    liaison to be viable. Quisog again thanked all those involved in making this possible;
    the empires for organizing the collection and pilots everywhere for their enthusiastic
    contribution.   \n  \nNow that the reconstruction effort is underway, the Jovians
    feel it\u2019s time to own up to their end of the bargain, with the gift of blueprint
    copies. These are blueprints for an advanced cloaking device not yet available
    to the general public and will undoubtedly come in handy for the recipients and
    their friends. Quisog promised that those pilots due a blueprint will receive
    their gift in the next 24 hours or so.   \n  \nThe announcement met with great
    approval and satisfaction from the assembled CONCORD members, who were greatly
    impressed by the cooperation and camaraderie shown by the participants during
    the collection. Many expressed their hope that this was just the first instance
    of many where pilots from all the races and all the factions could come and work
    together for the benefit of the whole of mankind."
