    Pashanai - In response to heightened terror alerts across the Amarr Empire following
    the Pashanai attack, Amarr Customs has mobilized to lock down civilian travel
    on many heavily trafficked transit routes. At checkpoints along the Ammatar-Minmatar
    border, the sudden density of traffic and limited customs presence has resulted
    in complete curtailment of trade and transit vessels.


    Jaikhan Dhomn, a Thukker merchant employed at the Trust Partners Trading Post
    in Tanoo, was planning to cross the border with his family when he learned of
    the security lockdown. "Everyone is afraid and angry after this [attack]. The
    Amarr fear us for what the Bloody Hand did, and we fear the Amarr for what they
    will do in return," he said.


    Capsuleer traffic remains unimpeded across the Empire. Amarr Customs Commander
    Bachain Zhaide commented, "Everything that happens to a capsuleer ship, every
    ounce of goods moved on or off it, is logged in meticulous detail by CONCORD.
    Amarr Customs has directives not to interrupt capsuleer traffic beyond standard
    procedure. We barely have enough manpower as it is, so if CONCORD keeps track
    of the capsuleers, we have more resources to dedicate to keeping everyone else
    safe."


    Amarr Customs has given no indication of when it expects the lockdown to end.'
