    The Lai Dai Corporation's Black Rise Development Conference opened its doors today,
    welcoming thousands of visitors to see several miles of booths displaying prototypes,
    technology demonstrations and grand plans.\n\nAmong the most popular displays
    were the Zero-G Research Firm's full-scale model of a next-generation orbital
    habitat - planned for prototype deployment before the end of the year - and a
    digital link to an experimental deadspace garden module by the Kaalakiota and
    Caldari Provisions.\n\nThe Lai Dai Corporation and its subsidiaries had a number
    of small displays of upcoming releases - among them a new series of low-maintenance
    atmospheric craft dubbed \"Snipe\", designed to be used by small colonies. In
    general, the Lai Dai presence has been small compared to other corporations, but
    rumors suggest that the megacorp is holding off on a big revelation.\n\n\"There
    has been talk for weeks of Lai Dai preparing something big. I've heard that their
    Storage Research team is here in Kinakka, ready to reveal a prototype,\" says
    Ulekkan Vindele, a hangar-floor manager for a capsuleer corporation. \"Of what,
    I can't say.\"\n\nDespite the mystery surrounding Lai Dai's own projects, it is
    clear that their goals for the conference are being met. Hundreds of projects
    opened their booths announcing that they were looking for investors, and within
    the end of the day the vast majority had secured the capital they needed to pursue
    their plans. \"We are ecstatic,\" said Norona Caaspien, celebrating with her team
    in the back of a booth showcasing their starbase capacitor prototype. \"We are
    so happy that someone would invest their time and money in our project, and that
    this conference made it possible for us to be seen.\""
