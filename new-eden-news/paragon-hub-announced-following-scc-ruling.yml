    Paragon Hub Announced Following SCC Ruling\n\nThe SCC has ruled that the NES\u2019s
    commissary contract is an antitrust violation. The exclusivity clause of their
    contract with the SOCT will be revoked effective immediately. The ruling follows
    an extensive legal campaign by EverMore, whose subsidiary Paragon has rushed to
    secure its own non-exclusive commissary contract. IRIS, Paragon\u2019s cybernetic
    liaison, has announced that they will be using the contract to launch a new store;
    the Paragon Hub.\n\n\u201CThe Paragon Hub is New Eden\u2019s first ever PLEX exchange
    to allow capsuleers to trade directly with one another,\u201D IRIS told members
    of the press at Paragon\u2019s station in Ouraphe. \u201CThe Hub is just one feature
    in a suite of SKINR innovations that put the power squarely where it belongs;
    in your hands.\u201D\n\nThe Paragon Hub will be launched as a part of an updated
    SKINR (Super-Kerr Induced Nanocoating Resequencer) platform next month.  Unlike
    its predecessor, which allowed capsuleers to design nanocoating finishes for Upwell
    structures, the new SKINR will focus on ship SKINs. It will include a wide array
    of improvements including the ability to sequence designs into tradeable SKIN
    licenses.\n\nThe New Eden Store has issued an official statement confirming that
    it is appealing the SCC\u2019s decision. Given the complexity of the issue, legal
    experts have advised the Scope that this appeal has little chance of success and
    is likely to take years. Individual members of the board have declined to comment,
    including the previously vocal Ganortchar Asabona who is unable to comment due
    to an ongoing legal battle with EverMore President Alexander Ducasse.\n\n### News
    in Brief\n\n- Reports of normalizing energy signatures in the Abyss as capsuleers
    keep a lid on Drifter-Triglavian conflict.\n\n- Tribal council still in session
    over Upwell controversy.\n\n- Ashes of Turnur declared a global terrorist threat
    by CONCORD following attack on Caldari State facilities."
