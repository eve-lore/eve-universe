    - A number of Konora officials, including Freedom Extension station administrator
    Korlo Seycha, have been arrested on charges ranging from corruption to collaboration
    with the enemy. Republic Fleet investigators believe the Konora food shortage
    crisis was engineered by a renegade splinter faction of Angels as a means to provide
    a plausible cover for their takeover of the system and potentially to cast themselves
    in the role of saviors.\n\nAdministrator Seycha is suspected of a leading role
    in orchestrating the shortages with his motivation alleged to be a multi-million
    ISK bribe from the leader of the renegades, Commander Origen. While the personal
    databases of Commander Origen have been recovered, it is unclear whether he himself
    escaped or was killed in the battle with Republic-Thukker forces. Few renegade
    ships were able to escape to the Great Wildlands and reports indicate that several
    that did were picked off by Angel Cartel raiders lying in wait.\n\nSuggestions
    that Thukker intelligence operatives may have coordinated with the Cartel have
    been met with an absolute refusal to comment by Thukker authorities. However,
    accumulated sensor data and eyewitness accounts of the battle at Konora have confirmed
    that the Thukker element of the relief fleet took advantage of a wormhole in the
    system to launch a surprise attack at the rear of the renegade force while it
    prepared to meet Republic forces head-on. The Thukker force commander, Jormal
    Kehok, refused to comment on the details of their attack but confirmed that some
    Thukker ships entered Konora by means of an unstable wormhole. Commander Ikel
    Freyakor of the Republic Military School observed, \"While such a strategy could
    not have been planned without a convenient wormhole, it illustrates the skill
    the Thukker are rapidly acquiring in the scouting and exploitation of wormholes.\"\n\nSanmatar
    Shakor's office has issued a statement declaring the emergency in Konora to be
    over and thanking the Republic Fleet and Thukker Tribe for their rapid action.
    Kaalakiota Corporation has declared itself 'satisfied' with Republic Fleet cooperation
    and re-opened their Konora station to civilian passenger traffic."
