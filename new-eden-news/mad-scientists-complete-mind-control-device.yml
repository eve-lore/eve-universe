- body: "Two days ago, the now infamous scientists, Albert Vance and Vic Stats, completed
    the construction of their mind control device before eluding Caldari authorities
    who had tracked them down to the Genesis region. \n\nLocal pilots caught sight
    of the renegade scientists in Genesis-region communications channels during the
    early hours of yesterday evening. The team of Caldari agents pursuing Vance and
    Stats, under the command of Pete Sance, were already en route to the Genesis region
    to act upon a search warrant granted by the Caldari courts when news of the sightings
    reached them. However, Vance and Stats were reportedly able to complete the device
    and evade Pete Sance, again utilising an Interbus transport, before the rapidly
    approaching agents could apprehend them. Reports have come in suggesting that
    the close proximity of their pursuers allowed Vance and Stats no time test the
    Mind Control device before they were forced to flee.\n\nIn related news, Executive
    Investigator Robin Cardil was arrested in his office late yesterday evening, accused
    of allegedly supplying the fugitive scientists with vital information that has
    allowed them to evade capture at every juncture up to this point. Cardil has been
    charged with treason, and is currently being held in custody in the lead up to
    his trial. This, and an application to have Vance and Stats banned from travelling
    on Interbus are keeping Caldari authorities positive about the prospects of an
    arrest in the immediate future."
