- body: "The Kor-Azor region continues to be the site of unrest, exemplified this
    week by the situation on Liparer II. \n\nThe debacle began when Holder Keraci
    was overheard by visiting Kor-Azor courtiers as he told his wife that Aritcio
    Kor-Azor is \u2018\u2018not fit to be Heir and belongs in a damn mental institution
    for his new regulations and sanctions.\u2019\u2019 \n\nWhen Aritcio heard word
    of what was being said on Liparer II he ordered that every Holder and his family
    on the planet would be stripped of his fine robes and dressed in rags of the lowest
    slave. A spokesperson for the Kor-Azor house commented \u2018\u2018How dare they
    talk about their lord sovereign this way? Such manner of treasonous speech shall
    not be tolerated. As punishment for such heinous talk they will henceforth live
    like slaves until such a time as our Lord Kor-Azor considers that they have paid
    for their crimes. These holders should consider themselves beneficent that their
    lord has chosen to be so merciful.\u2019\u2019 \n\nThe robes, sent to every Holder
    and his family, reek of unwashed slaves and have blood splatter and other unidentified
    substances on them. Aritcio was reported as stating \u2018\u2018What do they expect?
    That I send clothes smelling fresh and ironed? I ordered my men to find the dirtiest
    slave and bludgeon their heads in and take their clothes. They shall wear those
    and nothing else.\u2019\u2019 \n\nThe Holders refused the royal decree, resulting
    in Aritcio declaring the whole planet treasonous, ordering his military forces
    in and demanding all the holders' heads to be returned to him. The planet is currently
    under military blockade and there has been report of heavy fighting on the surface.
    \n\nReports have also been filtering in on sightings of a Speaker of Truths in
    the borderlands of Kor-Azor space. Aritcio's representatives have judged this
    as mere hearsay, for a Speaker has not been seen outside a monastery for centuries.
    Nevertheless, the representatives continue their investigation into the Speaker's
    appearance"
