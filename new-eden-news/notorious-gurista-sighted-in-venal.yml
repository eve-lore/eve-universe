    residents. \n\nHelmatt, who gained notoriety after downing a CONCORD battleship
    in November, destroyed two vessels piloted by members of the Phoenix Alliance
    in the 6NJ8-V system on Sunday. \n\nCommenting on this encounter, Phoenix Alliance's
    Second-In-Command, Reaso Ning, said that the Guristas had entered the system and
    announced that they \"would not engage those who didn't engage them. Some of our
    members took this as a challenge and engaged.\" Ning stated that one of the Worms
    was destroyed, but that the Phoenix Alliance lost those of their ships which entered
    the engagement when Lucash Helmatt showed up in a Rattlesnake. \n\n\"Afterward,
    communication channels were opened, and discussions began. It became clear that
    the Guristas' members represented a delegation seeking diplomatic ties. They have
    sought to establish a policy of co-existence and non-aggression with us.\" The
    Phoenix Alliance is still deciding whether to accept this offer of co-existence
    at this time. \n\nResponding to the news of Helmatt's resurgence in Venal, a CONCORD
    Public Relations Officer said, \"Rest assured, if he shows up anywhere within
    our jurisdiction, we will exact swift justice. He will pay for his crimes.\" \n\nLucash
    Helmatt was last in the public eye back in November of year 106, when he attacked
    two CONCORD Special Forces battleships. One of the CONCORD battleships was destroyed,
    with great loss of life, and the second, captained by Commander Plavers, was forced
    to retreat. After this [incident](http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=941&tid=6&s=165423489&sid=379241492),
    an official described Helmatt as \"an extremely dangerous and violent individual.\"
    \n\nSince November, there have been no recorded sightings of Helmatt, and it has
    been widely assumed that he has been in hiding. The Guristas' continued silence
    since Helmatt's disappearance has resulted in rampant speculation about their
    intentions. His sudden reappearance is widely expected to add fuel to the fire,
    not least among Venal residents. \n\nOne group currently based in Venal will certainly
    be pondering the Guristas' intentions. Pilots of the recently formed Dominion
    Empire alliance were amongst the first to see Helmatt. \n\nDominion Empire forces
    are currently fighting alongside The Five against the Phoenix Alliance and their
    allies. Max M, Dominion Empire pilot, and CEO of 5th Dimension, said of the encounter
    with the Guristas: \"They ran away, and didn't stop to fight. A few words were
    exchanged in local communication channels.\" \n\nWhen asked if Dominion Empire
    had an official stance towards the Guristas, Head of Public Relations, Matrix
    Aran, responded: \"No. Not yet.\""
