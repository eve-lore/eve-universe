- body: "YULAI - Capsuleers across the Federation were caught off guard yesterday
    evening by the appearance of a DED Special Weapons and Tactics unit that originated
    from their operational headquarters in Genesis. \n\nHeaded up by DED SWAT Director
    Arve Vesren, the task force was part of an ongoing investigation into the integrity
    of Federal border security in the wake of the Evaulon incident, in which over
    a quarter of a million Federal citizens lost their lives to a planetary assault
    orchestrated by the Serpentis Corporation.\n\nConsisting of a trio of Marshal-class
    battleships, the patrol made its way across Genesis into Federal space, stopping
    in Luminaire and Algogille before crossing into the Caldari Border Zone system
    of Kassigainen. After returning and making contact with Federal Tripwire personnel,
    the DED vessels then carried on to Stacmon before finally coming to rest in Dodixie,
    the largest trade hub in the Federation, where they were met with verbal hostility
    from capsuleers.\n\nAccording to several reports, no in-space aggression was committed
    against DED forces, and that the three battleships returned to Genesis this morning
    unmolested after an overnight stay with Federation Navy hospitality. A statement
    this morning from Director Vesren officially confirmed last night's patrol, and
    cited the reason for its presence within Federal space as \"a part of the ongoing
    investigation into the reasoning behind several severe breaches in Federal border
    security in recent months.\" Director Versren finished her statement with the
    assurance that \"as a result of this investigation, a full report is being prepared
    for the Federal Intelligence Office that includes recommendations for improvements
    to Federal border security in Placid, Essence and Verge Vendor.\"\n\nThoun Gaterau,
    Lead Field Agent for the prestigious Villore Division of the Federal Intelligence
    office this afternoon also released a statement claiming that \"the Federation
    Navy and Federal Intelligence Office were happy to host the Director Vesren and
    her wingmen for the evening, and will continue to co-operate fully with any reasonable
    requests that The CONCORD Assembly should have throughout the course of their
    investigation.\" When questioned by the press regarding the status of the Federation
    Navy Tripwire program and discussions between DED and Federal Military personnel,
    Agent Gaterau declined to comment further."
