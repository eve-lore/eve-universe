    has announced that it will be selling transcranial microcontrollers to interested
    Holders at \"bulk rates\".  \n  \n\"Ishukone is opening its arms to the Empire
    with this unprecedented offer,\" read the press release from the megacorp. \"With
    the recent debate in the Empire, knowledge and acceptance of Transcranial Microcontrollers
    will only grow. By offering to keep prices low and affordable, many holders may
    now benefit from their numerous applications as a method of workforce control.\"
    \ \n  \nThe press release urges interested holders to \"contact their nearest
    Ishukone representative for pricing and order size details.\" It is unknown how
    many holders will take up the offer, though Ishukone predicts the numbers will
    be \"significant.\"  \n  \nSome have claimed that the offer is meaningless, pointing
    to the declining popularity of the Caldari-made devices in a hostile Gallente
    Federation, the reduced production cost of technology several years old, as well
    as the availability of a number of similar devices on the market. \"Essentially,
    Ishukone is offering to cut out the 'brand name' price markup for holders,\" stated
    one analyst."
