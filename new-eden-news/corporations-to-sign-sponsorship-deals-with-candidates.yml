- body: "In the true spirit of lobbyism, the prolific pilot corporations can now sign
    up as supporters for one of the candidates competing for the presidency of the
    Federation. This will open up a formal path for them to follow later on, where
    the pilot corporations will compete amongst each other to become official sponsors
    of their chosen candidate. Apart from the rewards reaped for this, the victorious
    corporations will get to nominate one of their own to become an Emissary for the
    candidate in one of the six Federation regions. The eighteen Emissaries will then
    promote their candidate\u2019s cause, culminating on Election Day, when pilots
    get to vote their favorite Emissary.   \n  \nThe sign up phase will last for several
    weeks and is open to all pilot corporations interested in participating in the
    democratic procedures of the Federation. Once sign up is complete, the participating
    corporations start competing against each other with the aid of agents working
    for the candidates."
