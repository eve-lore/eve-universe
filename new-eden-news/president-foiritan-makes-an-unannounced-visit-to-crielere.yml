- body: "President Foiritan of the Gallente Federation recently made an unexpected
    visit to the Crielere research labs. Touring the facility the President learnt
    of the recent theft of blueprints and prototype equipment and was absolutely livid
    at the news. Foiritan was far from happy with how the Crielere command responded
    to the theft and felt is smacked of a cover-up. He demanded that an independent
    investigation team be formed and given complete access to the labs, brushing aside
    the feeble protests of the chief researchers.   \n  \nThe independent inquiry
    into the theft is now underway, working quickly to have a report ready in a few
    short days. Many are waiting anxiously for what might be found and it is believed
    that several high-ranking personnel of the facility have already handed in their
    resignation and gone into hiding."
