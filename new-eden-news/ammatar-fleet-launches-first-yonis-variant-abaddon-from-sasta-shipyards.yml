    - The Ammatar Fleet has launched its first 'Yonis variant' Abaddon-class battleship
    from a military shipyard in Sasta, the Fleet HQ system. The launch is the first
    of an unspecified number of Abaddon-class battleships from the Ardishapur house
    fleet that are being refitted for duties with the Ammatar Fleet.\n\nDesigned for
    extended 'prestige patrol' duties on the Minmatar border, the 'Yonis variant,'
    named after Royal Heir Yonis Ardishapur, is understood to have modified energy
    plants and does not carry the energy-hungry and crew-intensive tachyon beam batteries
    often seen on Imperial Navy Abaddon variants. The decision of the Ammatar Fleet
    to deploy the formidable Abaddon-class on the border with the Minmatar Republic
    is regarded by observers as yet another signal from Royal Heir Yonis Ardishapur
    that he considers it vital that the Mandate be a major contributor to the strategic
    goals of the Amarr Empire."
