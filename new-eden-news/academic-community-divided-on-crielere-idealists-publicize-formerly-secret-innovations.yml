    another assault by Guristas pirates, academics throughout the universe of EVE
    are divided in whether they support the somewhat stubborn idealism of Crielere
    founders Henric Touvolle and Taromi Umailen of refusing to bow to politics and
    free market pressure. In recent days, a trend has risen amongst engineers working
    for various corporations and races, to publicize formerly confidential blueprints,
    and have placed them on the open market for anyone to buy. Both nationalists and
    military officials ranging from the Amarr Empire to Gallante Federation are criticizing
    this venture claiming that introducing new combat modules to the market simply
    escalates the lawlessness that abounds these days and invites more terror by giving
    criminal elements easy access to advanced technology.  \n  \nAn engineer whose
    corporation has recently put a new blueprint on the market insisted that criminals
    already have this technology and it was the common man that gains from this, who
    until now was not able to defend himself properly."
