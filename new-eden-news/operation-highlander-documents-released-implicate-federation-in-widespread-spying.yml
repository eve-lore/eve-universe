- body: '_Orvolle - _[The Scope](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The Scope) has
    obtained and released a portion of the [Senate](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Senate)
    report on Operation Highlander. According to the dossier, the [Federation](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente)
    has had operatives infiltrating the [Caldari State](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari)
    since the outbreak of the Empyrean War in YC110. This includes numerous operatives
    engaged in long-term, deep-cover operations within all eight Caldari megacorporations.


    The released information claims several high-level megacorp executives had been
    compromised by intelligence operatives, contributing to the destabilization of
    the [Heth](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tibus Heth) regime prior to the
    attack on [Caldari Prime](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Prime). The
    names of the executives are absent from the document, but it claims none are still
    considered active assets for the Federation following the downfall of Heth. It
    does refer to several "less valuable assets" that remain within the megacorps,
    [Caldari Navy](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Navy), and [State Protectorate](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/State
    Protectorate).


    Citing whistleblower and freedom of information laws in its decision to release
    the information, the Scope has claimed the release of the document is legal. Despite
    this, [Black Eagles](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Black Eagles) operatives
    were seen raiding several of the Scope''s offices throughout the Federation.'
