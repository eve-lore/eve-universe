- body: Just when people thought he had disappeared forever, the Jovian renegade Ouria
    rears his ugly head yet again. Reliable sources indicate that Ouria, his gang
    and unidentified allies are on the move close to the Stain region and will be
    in the border zones adjacent to it at 17:00 GMT. CONCORD has already issued a
    general warning to all travelers in the area to take extra caution. Speculations
    are ripe that Ouria intends to block all access to the Stain region by setting
    up base in the border areas outside it.
