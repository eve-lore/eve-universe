- body: "ORVOLLE - The Scope has learned this morning that the navies of the Empire,
    Federation, State and Republic have begun to request specific components from
    sleeper vessels in order to determine the source of the recent spike in sleeper
    activity in recent weeks.\n\nSpeaking from Federation Navy headquarters in Algogille,
    Admiral Auver Bauvon of Tripwire Intelligence and Command expanded on the rumors,
    saying \"the Federation Navy believes that this change in Sleeper activity presents
    an enormous opportunity for deeper research into their technology, which will
    hopefully yield more fruitful results than previous avenues of testing.\"\n\nEchoing
    the sentiments of Admiral Bauvon, Valklear General Heder Elislar of the Republic
    Fleet also stressed the importance of the change in activity, stating that \"the
    Republic Fleet and Republic Security Services well be working around the clock
    with our best engineers and scientists to determine the best course of action
    to take advantage of this new data. This is very much a case of striking while
    the iron is hot, and ensuring we gather as much data as possible.\"\n\nShortly
    after the statement issued by the Republic Fleet, representatives from the Imperial
    Navy and Caldari Navy stepped forward to further reinforce the viewpoint.\n\nWhile
    at this time there still seems to be confusion over what this change in Sleeper
    activity could mean for the cluster, all four navies are requesting that capsuleers
    donate any spare salvage they may have to assist with research.\n\nAt present,
    the navies are looking to acquire the following:\n\n  * Neural Network Analyzer\n
    \ * Sleeper Data Library\n\n\n\nThis hardware can be delivered to the following
    navy representatives:\n\n  * Federation Navy - Auvier Bauvon\n  * Caldari Navy
    - Hikemi Korrado\n  * Republic Fleet - Heder Elislar\n  * Imperial Navy - Ren
