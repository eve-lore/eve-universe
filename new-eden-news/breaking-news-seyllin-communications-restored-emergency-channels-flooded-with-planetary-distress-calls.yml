- body: 'SEYLLIN 0936 - Fluid router traffic restored with Seyllin I has opened to
    a flood of distress signals originating from all four primary cities of the Federation
    planet. It is believed that the communications system was restarted autonomously
    following a self-imposed shutdown to protect itself from an external threat. Emergency
    channels have since been overwhelmed with distress calls, many with specific requests
    for an evacuation from the planet itself. There is no official word on the cause
    of this calamity or the extent of damage incurred. CONCORD and Federation vessels
    are reported to be scrambling towards the planet at this time.


    This is a breaking news story. More information will be provided when available.'
