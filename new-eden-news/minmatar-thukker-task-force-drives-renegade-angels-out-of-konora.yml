    - After fierce fighting in Konora, first reports are that the breakaway Angels
    have been driven from the Konora system in disarray, with most of their ships
    destroyed by a combined Minmatar-Thukker fleet and renegade ground forces overwhelmed
    by Minmatar Republic shock troops. Thukker Tribe forces are confirmed to have
    been present at the engagement, with the allied fleet outnumbering the renegade
    Angels by at least two-to-one.\n\nDespite intelligence indicating a massed force
    of renegade ships was ready to respond to any incursion by the rapidly-assembled
    Republic Fleet task force, a decision to assault as quickly as possible was taken
    at the highest level. The presence of a substantial Thukker force, able to simultaneously
    attack from out of the Great Wildlands, gave Republic commanders confidence that
    a lightning strike would not be as risky as other situational factors appeared
    to indicate.\n\nReports from the relieved colonies have the total death toll among
    local citizens approaching 200. Some of the dead are thought to have been collaborators
    summarily executed by citizenry resistance. Meanwhile, few renegade prisoners
    have been taken. The fate of Commander Origen, the splinter faction's erstwhile
    spokesman, is unknown. Republic and Thukker forces have been universally welcomed
    by the tens of thousands of surviving colonists."
