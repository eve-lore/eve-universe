- body: 'VILLORE - Vessels belonging to the Federation Navy and the Black Eagles have
    been seen arriving at the headquarters of the Gallente Senate this morning, amidst
    a flurry of activity in preparation for the Inauguration of President Jacus Roden
    on Thursday.


    The Scope has learned that security efforts aboard the station have been heightened
    due to recent events, with extra cordons in place and the denial of access by
    press to the Senate chamber until Thursday, while preparation for the ceremony
    is underway.


    In addition to security forces this morning, a Megathron Federate issue bearing
    the seal of the President of the Gallente Federation and a Senate call sign was
    seen arriving unannounced under a combined Federation Navy and Directive Enforcement
    Department escort shortly after noon today, which would indicate that President
    Roden has arrived in Villore and will remain until after the ceremony on Thursday.


    With preparation now in full swing for Thursday''s ceremony, the Roden administration
    has already come under criticism regarding Federal security after the uncloaking
    of unidentified structures within Federal borders, and several breaches of the
    Tripwire border control system by the vessels accompanying them.


    It is expected that the Federation Navy will remain on high alert until the ceremony
    is concluded and President Roden is re-inaugurated for his second term.'
