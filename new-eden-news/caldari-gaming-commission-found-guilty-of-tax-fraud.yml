- body: "The committee investigating the alleged tax fraud presented its findings
    to the Chief Executive Panel earlier today. The committee concluded that 'the
    Caldari Gaming Commission (CGC) is guilty of tax evasion for trying to hide 3.4
    billion isk from the State.' \n\nThe CEP has announced that they will abide by
    the decision of the committee, lead by Prof. Sari Hazel, and will act on the recommendations
    given. \n\n'We (the CEP) have reached an agreement to accept the conclusion stated
    in the report. We unanimously decided that the best course of action, for all
    parties involved, is for the CGC to pay back the evaded revenue with an additional
    penalty of 1.5 billion', stated Jukkizaras Aboraala, Principal Clerk of the Chief
    Executive Panel, in a press conference. \n\nDabel Kaelikohani responded to the
    verdict in a companywide e-mail, declaring it an 'unjust, biased decision influenced
    by greed' while expressing his doubts on the future of the CGC."
