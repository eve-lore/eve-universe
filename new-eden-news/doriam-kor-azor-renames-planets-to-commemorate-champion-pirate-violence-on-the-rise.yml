- body: "Amarr Emperor Doriam Kor-Azor has issued a decree stating that planet IV
    in the Kor-Azor system shall be known as Eclipticum. Its moons will now be named
    \"Black Viperia\", \"Griklaeum\" and \"Kileakum\". These name changes are to commemorate
    the champion whose combat skills earned Doriam the throne.   \n  \nImperial chamberlain
    Dasham Nestorik was quoted saying \"the heroes of our empire are never forgotten,
    never ignored. Our beloved Emperor wanted to give his champion his place among
    the stars\u201D.   \n  \nCritics claim that Kor-Azor is trying to divert the public\u2019s
    attention from increased pirate activity in the outer regions that has resulted
    in a spate of apparently senseless killings in the past days. Although the problem
    is not solely focused on Amarr space, Kor-Azor has made it his personal agenda
    to address this issue as quickly and decisively as possible.   \n  \nEmperor Kor-Azor
    has been meeting with his security advisors and is believed to be working on a
    strategy to counter this deterioration in stability. \u201CThere are always those
    who envy us of our glory, our power and our purity of purpose. They will hunt
    our weaker brothers and ambush our undeserving traders. The Emperor does not and
    will never accept this\u201D, Nestorik said."
