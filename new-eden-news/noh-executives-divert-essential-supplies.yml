- body: 'Josameto - Nugoeihuvi Corporation (NOH) has been diverting essential supplies
    from their usual routes within the Caldari State, greatly risking commercial stability
    for their own profit by purchasing freight contracts at preferential rates from
    shipping agents, sources within the Caldari Business Tribunal (CBT) alleged yesterday.
    According to the statement, Nugoeihuvi CEO Morimo Yagala has taken a personal
    lead in persuading shippers to relinquish their contracts, funnelling the redirected
    shipments into more lucrative markets that include undisclosed destinations within
    the State.


    Although these supply diversions are not illegal, CBT sources have indicated that
    an investigation has been requested by the CEO of another State megacorporation.
    While sources suggest that the CBT investigation team - whose research was to
    remain confidential to protect commercial interests and State security - has been
    blocked from pursuing certain lines of inquiry, independent researchers have been
    able to analyze the pattern of diverted shipments. Their analysis suggests the
    corporations who have been most adversely affected by the consequent lack of supplies
    are those specializing in deep-space research and development of long-range communication
    and transport technologies.


    It has not yet been possible to confirm or discount the reports that these diversions
    have caused shortages for specific corporations, leading to worker ration cuts
    and temporary suspension of operations at some facilities. CBT investigators are
    valuing the diverted shipments at over 100 billion ISK for the purposes of export.
    NOH executives were unavailable for comment.'
