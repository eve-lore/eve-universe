- body: "LUMINAIRE \u2013 Last weeks daring theft of a Federation Navy mothership
    by Admiral Siral of the Serpentis Corporation resulted in not only the loss of
    the stolen ship, but the destruction of four CONCORD Special Operations vessels.
    The stolen Federation Nyx was destroyed in the PFP-GU system of the Syndicate
    by a combined fleet of Goonswarm and 3rd Front Alliance vessels. However the CONCORD
    losses occurred in Stacmon where they were the victims of an unruly gang of capsule
    pilots that had been originally formed to help eradicate the Serpentis Admiral.
    \n\nCONCORD Inspector Ronier was one of the first to respond to the report of
    the stolen Federation Nyx in the Luminaire system. After he had confirmed the
    reported crime he quickly called on the local capsule pilot community for assistance.
    Although he assured all pilots in the system that CONCORD would not engage them
    if they attacked the Nyx, many were hesitant to open fire on the mothership. This
    hesitation provided the Serpentis Admiral with the opportunity to jump the capital
    ship to the PFP-GU system and escape. \n\nCONCORD ships then moved to the Stacmon
    system and used it as a rallying point for pilots who wished to help in the attack
    against Siral in PFP-GU. While pilots where assembling in Stacmon in answer to
    CONCORD\u2019s call to arms, an unknown pilot was attacked by the stolen mothership
    in PFP-GU and sent a message via an alliance FTL channel informing 3rd Front Alliance
    and Goonswarm of the threat. \n\n3rd Front was the first to engage Admiral Siral
    in PFP-GU and were quickly joined by Goonswarm. 3FA pilot Shade Gallowglass recalled
    \u201CHer shields and armor were taking a beating and still [the mothership] fired
    on and on. The fighters seemed endless.\u201D The combined fleet of 3rd Front
    and Goonswarm was enough to destroy the stolen mothership. \n\nThose pilots in
    Stacmon that were hastily recruited to help CONCORD pursue the renegade Admiral
    did not take kindly to the news that the vessel had been destroyed. Although all
    pilots that joined the FTL channel created by CONCORD for the operation were informed
    that \u2018A combined bounty of 750million ISK has been queued for those involved
    in the destruction of the stolen mothership piloted by Admiral Siral.\u2019 Many
    of those assembled in Stacmon had only seen Inspector Ronier\u2019s statement
    that, \u201COur rally point is Stacmon, Come quickly and you will be rewarded.\u201D
    \n\nWith the stolen ship destroyed and no reward forthcoming for the pilots that
    had gathered in the Stacmon system the situation became intense. Capsuleer Syris
    Anu provoked hostilities in the CONCORD channel shouting \u201CGet him! He led
    us astray!\u201D which prompted the assembled fleet to attack the Concord pilots.
    Inspector Ronier and Sergeants Judra, Alfotada, and Tomon lost their vessels during
    the retaliation. Sergeant Judra\u2019s capsule was also confirmed destroyed though
    the sergeant is believed to be recovering at a Concord cloning facility after
    a successful clone activation. \n\nInspector Navikila did issue this after action
    statement \u201CWe find the actions of the pilots in question to be on par with
    general pod pilot activity. On a daily basis we see the best and worst of human
    nature, so while this incident saddens us, it does not surprise us.\u201D When
    asked if the Pod Pilots involved in the attack on CONCORD would be punished, Navikila
    declined to comment. \n\nAll subsequent inquiries into the incident and possible
    penalties for pilots involved have been referred to Assistant Commissioner Aldun.
    Who stated \"CONCORD has no public statement at this time.\""
