- body: '_Luminaire - _The [Federation Navy](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Federation
    Navy) today released a statement detailing Operation Highlander, the code-name
    for the offensive on [Caldari Prime](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari
    Prime) that ended with the destruction of the Shiigeru. The statement declared
    the operation an "overall success", while noting that certain details did not
    go as planned.


    In particular, the Federation Navy expressed dismay at the crashing of the Shiigeru
    into Caldari Prime and the damage caused, though it noted that a much larger disaster
    was prevented by the destruction of the ship''s engines while it was still in
    orbit. Additionally, the release put to question the belief that the [Federation](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente)
    had overall supremacy which would have enabled its ground forces to oust the Caldari
    defense planetside. "Despite orbital superiority, the [Caldari ](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari)forces
    remaining on the planet had control of enough orbital defenses to make supply
    drops unfeasible. It is believed any offenses to secure these defense batteries
    would have been too costly to attempt."


    The statement went on to say that the Navy fully agreed with the [Senate''s](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Senate)
    decision to turn Caldari Prime into a demilitarized zone and was already pulling
    out its forces. "Despite the destruction and chaos on the ground, the Federal
    Navy understands that leaving its own armed forces on the ground would only cause
    needless tension which might reignite fighting. That is why we, along with the
    Caldari ground forces, are withdrawing and turning over security of the planet
    to [Mordu''s Legion](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Mordu''s Legion)."


    The knowledge that Mordu''s Legion is taking over security for the planet had
    not previously been released by any party, though representatives for the Senate,
    [Chief Executive Panel](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Chief Executive Panel),
    and Mordu''s Legion have all independently confirmed its truth.


    Citizens across the Federation have been heavily positive about the press release
    and the knowledge it contained. "We had to get rid of that [Titan](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Titans),"
    said a citizen of Gallente Prime. "They were holding people on Caldari Prime hostage.
    And imagine what could have happened if they decided to warp it over to Gallente
    Prime. I can sleep more soundly at night with it gone."


    Another said, "It''s sad that so many people had to die. But that''s what war
    is. The good thing is we can limit to only necessary deaths. If we kept fighting
    for the planet, more and more people would be killed. And if the Navy is right,
    and the Federation might not even have taken it... Well, it was the Caldari''s
    planet in the first place. They deserve to live there in peace just as much as
    anyone else."'
