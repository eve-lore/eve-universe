    Over a month has passed since a team of 16 Amarr slaves took part in the successful
    rescue of 176 trapped Caldari miners before being subsequently released. Each
    of the freed slaves indicates that they are content in their new lives. According
    to Ducia Foundry, seven of them have returned to their previous owner, The Ducia
    Foundry, as employees, while the rest have moved on to careers with other astro-surveying
    teams throughout New Eden.\n\nReporters caught up with Foitien Stourli, one of
    the former slaves, hard at work in the depths of yet another asteroid. When asked
    about his new life, he said, \"It's taking some time for me to process. I can't
    express how grateful I am to Aszhar Freimala and everyone involved. I have great
    food, shorter hours, and simple comforts. The only thing is that I don't know
    what to do with all my free time. I'm hoping the Lord will bless me with some
    purpose out here.\"\n\nIn related news, the former Annaro police commander Garr
    Diymir was sentenced to two months of house arrest and fined 1,000 ISK for illegally
    diverting police resources to allow the Ducia Foundry slaves to enter Caldari
    space and perform the rescue. Unofficial surveys indicate the majority of Caldari
    citizens support his decision. Diymir cannot legally return to the Annaro police
    corporation, but he has been offered a position with Spacelane Patrol, CBD Corporation's
    corporate security force, upon his release from house arrest."
