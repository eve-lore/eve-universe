- body: "Yulai, Genesis - CONCORD has confirmed that it has begun major operations
    to counter the threats apparently posed by Triglavian \"stellar observation and
    manipulation efforts\" in multiple systems across New Eden. The primary co-ordinator
    of planetary and orbital defense against Triglavian invasions, Provost Marshal
    Kasiha Valkanir said, \"I can confirm that CONCORD is co-ordinating closely with
    member states in a broad effort to thwart Triglavian attempts to manipulate star
    system environments across New Eden.\"\n\nThe Scope has established that flashpoints
    between Triglavian forces and CONCORD/local empire forces are scenes of fierce
    space combat in at least half a dozen star systems. Capsuleers have reported Triglavian
    stellar platforms and CONCORD observatories are the focus of fighting in Aedald,
    Agal, Furskeshin, Kihtaled, Oberen and Skarkon systems. Triglavian invasion forces
    are present in a number of systems surrounding the flashpoints.\n\nMost disturbing
    of all are [reports ](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/arc-breaking-triglavian-battle-escalates-in-amarr-space/202835)that
    capsuleers are fighting on the side of both CONCORD and Triglavian forces. The
    Scope has also learned that the Triglavian Collective has apparently aimed a [message](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/Triglavian/rani9921.mp4)
    that may be a direct appeal for capsuleers to join their forces. Experts in Triglavian
    communication protocols have translated the \"DIRECTIVE KYBERNAUT\" message as
    follows:\n\nGLORIFICATION AWAITS THOSE FIT TO JOIN THE FLOW OF VYRAJ  \nLIMINAL
    POTENTIAL IS DIVINED AMONG AUGMENTED NARODNYA  \nPROVING OF KYBERNAUTS IN THE
    ANCIENT DOMAINS IS INVOKED  \nGUIDE AND GROUND THE FLOW AND BE FIT FOR GLORIFICATION
    \ \nOBSTRUCT AND MORTIFY THE FLOW AND YOU WILL BE EXTIRPATED\n\nAnalysts believe
    the Triglavian term \"Kybernaut\" refers specifically to capsuleers based on intercepts
    of Collective communications apparently discussing augmented pilot corpses recovered
    from the remains of \"singleton command nucleus vessels\".\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/CONCORD_Observatory_Battle.jpeg)

    Marshal Valkanir also commented on these reports:  \"CONCORD's Directive Intelligence
    Agency believes the Triglavians are attempting to entice independent capsuleers
    into renegade actions that would suit the interests of the invaders. The Triglavians
    pose an existential threat to all of New Eden. We trust that capsuleers will continue
    their efforts to combat the Triglavian menace and work with local defense forces
    to this end.\"\n\nQuestioned on the consequences of siding with the Triglavians,
    the head of AEGIS replied, \"Any capsuleer siding with the Triglavian invaders
    is a traitor to civilization on a level with the dupes of Sansha's Nation and
    the murderous followers of the Blood Raiders. We condemn them utterly and warn
    them that they are playing with the very future and survival of New Eden.\"\n\nCONCORD
    and core empire forces are co-operating broadly on many fronts with major investment
    in planetary defense, star system monitoring and invasion response fleets flowing
    from the New Eden Defense Fund. Large numbers of CONCORD personnel are also in
    combat daily with Triglavian forces and their drone auxiliaries. Provost Marshal
    Valkanir was able to confirm that SARO commandos had successfully boarded a Triglavian
    defense pylon recently \"at great risk to their lives, preventing its self-destruct
    protocols from triggering and allowing us to analyze its technology.\"\n\n \n\n**In
