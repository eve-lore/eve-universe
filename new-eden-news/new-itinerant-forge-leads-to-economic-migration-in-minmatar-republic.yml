    New \"Itinerant Forge\" Leads to Economic Migration in Minmatar Republic\n\nPator,
    Heimatar \u2013 In a rare joint announcement, Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor, Sebiestor
    Tribal Chief Acassa Midular, and Vherokior Tribal Chief Isardsund Urbrald have
    unveiled to interstellar markets the Minmatar Republic\u2019s new \u201CItinerant
    Forge\u201C project. \n\nChief Midular explained, \u201CThe Itinerant Forge is
    a new industrial doctrine using modular machinery that can be quickly assembled
    and disassembled, allowing us to deploy our best technologies to any colony.\u201D
    According to Chief Urbrald, \u201COur tribes have worked together to create a
    traveling infrastructure. Caravans of industrial ships will move from planet to
    planet, ensuring we can build whatever we need wherever we need it.\u201D Sanmatar
    Shakor praised this new development as a \u201Cboon for the entire Republic. By
    stepping outside the rigid mindsets of other nations the Itinerant Forge project
    will unlock a better and brighter future for all Minmatar.\u201D\n\nRecruitment
    drives on Republic planets have already signed up millions of citizens to crew
    the new project\u2019s caravans, indicating significant economic migration to
    come across the Republic. Chief Midular, a noted advocate for greater tribal autonomy,
    celebrated the project's popularity amongst Minmatar citizens of all backgrounds,
    \u201CI have no doubt that our Republic must allow its tribes the independence
    they need to thrive, but that does not mean our tribes should not cooperate with
    one another. The Itinereant Forge will help independent communities of all tribes
    to thrive, including the clans of Sebiestor.\u201D\n\nNot all agree that the project
    will have a positive impact on smaller communities. Many of those joining Itinerant
    Forge caravans come from smaller clans with limited employment opportunities.
    This has led clan chieftains from across the Republic to accuse the project of
    being \u201Cmobile centralization\u201D, fearing that their clans will struggle
    to survive with a reduced labor pool. \n\n\u201CMany have already left to enlist
    in the Republic Fleet,\u201D said Chief Klaes Gyrri, the leader of a small Krusual
    clan holding in the low sec system of Odebeinn. \u201CHow will we survive if all
    our young people leave to join this traveling industrial circus?\u201D Gyrri\u2019s
    clan has a long history of harvesting and refining Luminous Kermite. Only this
    year, she fears they may lack the people needed to run their clan's refinery or
    protect their mining fleet from attacks. When asked if she had reached out to
    the Republic for support Gyrri responded, \u201CWhat cares the mountain for the
    wolf\u2019s cries?\u201D quoting \u201CFrom the Flames\u201D, an anthology by
    Turnur survivor and outspoken critic of the Republic, Kam\xED D\xEDa. As for whether
    her words will ring true for Chief Gyrri\u2019s clan, only time will tell.\n\n![gallente

    Aguard's \"United Response Act\" Begins in Divided Senate\n\nVillore, Essence
    \u2013 President Celes Aguard's new legislative program moves forward today, as
    the Federal Senate debates the controversial bill for a \"United Response Act\"
    proposed by the Progressive Union and supported by other allies of the President's
    administration.\n\nThe United Response legislation has rapidly become controversial
    as its proposals for greater federal oversight of industry, transportation, and
    taxation at the district level have become more widely known. Proposed with the
    strong backing of President Aguard, the bill has been crafted by a coalition of
    senators centered on the Progressive Union party in order to \"support the urgent
    need to reconfigure the economy of the Federation to meet the needs of increased
    security requirements and threats to our way of life.\"\n\nOpponents of the bill
    have characterized it as a \"power grab\", and it has attracted the ire of voices
    from across the political spectrum. Left-leaning Federalist-Liberals such as Senator
    Suvio Bellaron have found some measure of common cause with even the right-wing
    of the Labor-Populists as exemplified by Senator Thibauld Tailler.\n\nPresident
    Aguard has apparently chosen to press ahead with the measures given the support
    of her Progressive Union backers, and allies such as Senator Faron Shu representing
    Lirsautton's Jin-Mei interests. Senator Shu has long been a hawkish figure in
    Federation politics, and while strongly opposed to interference in Jin-Mei culture,
    has often been happy to back President Aguard on the basis of carve outs protecting
    member states and nations from interference in social matters. It is also believed
    that in reorienting her legislative focus towards the military and industrial
    sectors, President Aguard has also been able to convert New Sociocrat politicians
    such as Senator Filidor Cassiete of Eustron district to her cause.\n\n![fednav

    Autonomists Form New Intaki Assembly Administration with Social Co-operative Party\n\nIntaki,
    Placid \u2013 Following an agreement on a coalition with the Social Co-operative
    Party, Intaki Autonomist leader Jonas Ivestara has taken up his post as Chief
    Councillor of the Intaki Assembly, and head of government for Intaki Prime and
    the wider system.\n\nDespite falling short of gaining a majority of the 547 seats,
    the Intaki Autonomists' tally of 202 was the largest number of a single party,
    given the previous ruling moderate faction led by Vera en Sullacio was itself
    a coalition of the Federalist-Liberal, Labor-Populist, and Social Co-operative
    parties. Having fallen to a total of 234 elected members the moderates were unable
    to build a majority given the implacable opposition of the Autonomists or the
    Intaki Lamkatka party. \n\nThe key breakthrough came when the Social Co-operative
    Party agreed it could work with the Autonomists and added their 63 seats to the
    bloc being built by Jonas Ivestara. As the Autonomists had already managed to
    come to terms with a loose grouping of 12 local and independent politicians, the
    agreement with the Social Co-op assembly members pushed the new bloc over the
    line for a total of 277 seats.\n\nDespite the agreement, managing the thin majority
    and potentially fragile Autonomist-Social bloc is sure to be a considerable balancing
    act for Chief Councillor Ivestara. The challenge posed by the radical nationalists
    of the Intaki Lamkatka group is also notable, with their 83 elected members constituting
    a significant group that may sway  votes where the governing bloc is at odds with
    itself.\n\nThe agreement is a considerable blow to Vera en Sullacio, with the
    moderate faction that had long dominated Intaki politics collapsing in large part
    due to the militarization of the Intaki system by Federation forces and the consequent
    social and political aftershocks. Her own Federalist-Liberal party remains the
    second largest with 115 elected members, while their Labor-Populist allies have
    fallen to only 56 seats in the Assembly\n\n![dcm 4 4 moon elevator](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/67uQbXCOp13PO9aRGBuyFI/c59789c0d32dfb9c1b640038e3436e9f/dcm_4_4_moon_elevator.png)
