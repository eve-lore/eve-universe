- body: "God's Righteousness Conclave, an Amarrian fundamentalist group, released
    a follow-up statement moments ago. \"We warned of the dangers of associating with
    heretics, and yet thousands responded to help.  \n  \nGod's warning against iniquity
    and sin was not heeded, and the consequences shall now be paid. While we mourn
    any loss of life, those lost in the Seyllin system shall serve as a stark reminder
    to both the glory and power of God. It is through that sole path of purity that
    heresy and its support are punished.\"  \n  \nAmarr government officials would
    not comment directly on the group's statement, directing reporters to Empress
    Jamyl's previous statements regarding the situation in Seyllin."
