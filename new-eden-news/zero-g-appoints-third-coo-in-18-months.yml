    The Zero-G Research Firm board voted today to replace the company's COO for the
    second time in a year and a half after the company posted multi-billion ISK losses
    for the fourth quarter in a row. The Kaalakiota subsidiary has been dogged by
    production problems over the last year, despite a promising showing at last fall's
    Black Rise Development Conference.\n\nThe next-generation habitat presented at
    that conference, initially expected to go into production this summer, has been
    pushed off until at least early YC 113 due to continuing delays at component factories.\n\nMany
    business analysts expected the change, citing not only Zero-G's business troubles
    but also rumors that outgoing COO Ishuhara Kappunen was regularly butting heads
    with Zero-G's suppliers and business partners. \"Zero-G's stock has taken a pummeling
    since the announcement of the production delays,\" said Taimo Poraila, an analyst
    at Modern Finances, on today's \"Games of State.\" \"The board had to do something
    to reassure investors, and Kappunen was an obvious target.\"\n\nBoth Kappunen
    and his predecessor, Hetsen Appas, were previously high-ranking members of the
    Caldari Providence Directorate prior to being appointed COO, and Zero-G CEO Nanata
    Yansen is a prominent ally of Tibus Heth. This relationship has given some ammunition
    to the Directorate's critics, who have pointed to the problems at Zero-G as a
    case for Provist mismanagement. So far, however, the general public seems to be
    taking this as an isolated case, and confidence in Directorate leadership remains
    high."
