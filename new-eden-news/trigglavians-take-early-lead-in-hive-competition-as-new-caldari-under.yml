    New Caldari Under Crisis\nThe Caldari State capital system of New Caldari is experiencing
    a Drifter Crisis. The State military is scrambling to respond as Drifter forces
    have begun attacking megacorporation infrastructure within the system. The Chief
    Executive Panel has put out a joint announcement calling for all Capsuleers loyal
    to the State to help fight off this new threat. The statement was delivered by
    Chairman Akimaka Saraki beside the Landfall monument. The Chairman refused to
    join his staff in a bunker beneath the city despite his security team's requests.\n\n\u201CToday
    our enemy comes to the heart of our State without care or caution. They believe
    that they are strong, and that we are no more than their playthings. They are
    wrong.\n\n\u201CThey would see us suffer, but suffering is the fire that hardens
    our resolve. They would terrorize us, but we are without fear. They fight without
    honor, but it is our honor and our sense of duty that are our greatest strengths.\n\n\u201CTo
    all who fly and would call themselves Caldari, now is the time to prove who we
    are. Let us send these cowards back through the wormhole they crawled out of.
    Then, we follow them, and teach them the true meaning of regret.\u201D\n\n###
    The Race Begins\n\nTen factions have begun researching new means of access Drifter
    wormholes with the help of capsuleers. Only five factions will be able to lay
    claim to a Drifter wormhole system. So far the Triglavians are leading the way
    by a landslide, with over 45% of all the progress made in these early hours of
    the competition.\n\n![Race For The Hives Contribution Share 1](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/4FZAEdH6EfmcGPlgjevwZg/1ceb7e7594032f34952dfeb376cd4cc2/Factiongraph.png)\n###
    Results in Full\nThis graph, and the information below, show each participating
    faction's share of the total contributions received up to this point:\n\n- Triglavian
    - 46.3%\n- Amarr - 14.0%\n- Angel - 8.3%\n- Gallente - 8.2%\n- Caldari - 6.6%\n-
    Minmatar - 5.6%\n- EDENCOM - 4.6%\n- EverMore\t- 3.0%\n- Upwell - 2.7%\n- SOCT
    - 0.8%\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe Triglavians have been in conflict with the Drifters
    since their first encounter. Some academics have even theorized that this is the
    latest leg of an even more ancient conflict. The Scope reached out to the Triglavian
    forces inside Pochven for comment on their advancement. All we received in return
    was this anonymous statement:\n\nThe struggle is all-time istina. Kybernauts seek
    glorification by surpassing followers of the poshlost. Dedication grants proving
    of direction in the flow. Advanced-time extirpation of the Ancient Enemy Azdajza
    approaches.\n\nOf the four major factions, the Amarr Empire is leading so far
    in contributions, taking second place overall. The Amarr lost their previous Empress
    to a Drifter fleet. They have often held the lead in crisis completions and it
    is no surprise to see faithful capsuleers offering their Empire early support.
    Empress Catiz I called this \u201Ca righteous sign of our people's dedication.
    Once again we rise on every front to claim our rightful place among the stars.\u201D\n\nThe
    Angel Cartel has made a surprisingly strong showing in these first hours, claiming
    third place so far. This shadowy criminal organization is believed to be primarily
    interested in access to Drifter tech and protecting its existing clandestine operations
    from disruption. The Angel Cartel is shrouded in secrets, and fired upon the Scopes
    shuttle when it approached them for comment.\n\nFilling out the top-five are the
    Gallente and Caldari. These long-term rivals have both managed to beat out the
    Minmatar Republic in the early days of the competition. The Caldari have been
    one of the Crisis' top performers, while the Gallente initially failed to mount
    a strong opposition. Both must now summon greater support if they wish to secure
    their positions.\n\nThe Society of Conscious Thought is so far ranking a distant
    last of all participants, raising questions over how the public has perceived
    their recent activities. The Society came under scrutiny following accusations
    that they had attempted to infiltrate Thukker clans via education programs. The
    Society dismissed these claims as fabrications, but some question what the true
    motives of this ancient organization are.\n\nThe impact of the Harmonics recovered
    in Tabbetzur last week has yet to be measured in these results. Recipients are
    likely racing to decipher what they can from these items before the Deathless
    Circle is able to disable them. Market manipulators initially attempted to block
    intended recipients from receiving these items using buy orders disguised as legitimate
    interest, but factions were able to circumvent this problem using their LP stores
    to process the items instead. \n\nThese results are only from the first few hours
    of the attempt, and with many days of research ahead of these factions, the prize
    is still anyone\u2019s to claim.\n"
