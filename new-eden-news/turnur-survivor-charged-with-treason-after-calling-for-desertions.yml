    of Turnur I*\n### Turnur Survivor Charged with Treason After Calling for Desertions\n\nPator,
    Heimatar \u2013 The writer and Turnur survivor, Kam\xED D\xEDa, has released a
    holoreel calling for Republic troops to abandon their posts. The holoreel has
    been covertly distributed by D\xEDa\u2019s supporters throughout the Republic\u2019s
    military. It contains a recording of her condemning the Republic for its failure
    to protect smaller clan holdings from a recent rise in criminal activity and pirate
    attacks. According to D\xEDa these attacks are the result of the Republic\u2019s
    desire to embrace new technologies such as its new \"Itinerant Forge\" project.
    \n\nHer ire is particularly aimed at the Republic\u2019s investigations into Stellar
    Harvester technology, the same technology responsible for the Turnur event which
    wiped out her own clan. According to D\xEDa, \u201CFar from the front, your people
    are burning. Listen now to the crackling flames, for they call you home. When
    the fire came for my people, the Republic could not hold it back. Will you trust
    them to save yours?\u201D\n\nKam\xED D\xEDa is a survivor of the Turnur I disaster,
    and the author of the bestselling \u201CFrom the Flames\u201D, a collection of
    her lost clan's songs and legends. It also contains poems and philosophical essays
    written by D\xEDa herself. The collection is critical of the Republic and its
    interest in Trigvlavian technologies. These criticisms have struck a chord with
    many among the smaller clans who feel abandoned by the Republic, earning D\xEDa
    a dedicated following. \n\nIn her own writings, D\xEDa refers to the Republic
    as an \u201Cunworthy echo of Old Matar\u2019s glory\u201D. Old Matar is the name
    she gives to Minmatar society prior to the Amarr occupation. While historians
    and archaeologists claim that the tribes of the Minmatar united millennia prior
    to their expansion into space, D\xEDa believes that this is a misrepresentation
    of the true spirit of the Matari people. \n\nAccording to Kam\xED D\xEDa, their
    ancestors were more focused on their own clans and a spirit of individuality than
    the tribes or unification: \u201CThe Republic demands control while pleading for
    unity. The true Matari heart burns with a yearning for independence.\u201D She
    holds that this independence would often be characterized by acts of violence
    and dominance, with displays of force being preferable to attempts at diplomacy.\n\n![rep

    *Above: Republic Fleet military facilities in Amo system*\n\n### Republic Military
    and Security Forces React to Threat of Sedition\n\nAmo, Metropolis \u2013 Hetman
    General Kanth Filmir has condemned the holoreel as an \u201Cinexcusable act of
    sedition\u201D. A warrant has been issued for Kam\xED D\xEDa\u2019s arrest on
    charges of treason by the Republic Justice Department, but as of yet her location
    is unknown. \n\nGeneral Filmir said: \u201CD\xEDa is clearly troubled and driven
    to instability by an unimaginable tragedy. However, this in no way excuses her
    actions. Turnur was a catastrophe of Amarr's creation and to claim the Republic
    did not do its best to save lives is unequivocally false. Kam\xED D\xEDa herself
    escaped the fate of the rest of her clan aboard a Republic evacuation ship. The
    war we fight now we fight on the behalf of those who were not so fortunate. We
    must be united against our true enemy, the Amarr, not descend into petty squabbles.\u201D
    \n\nWhen pressed on the truth of D\xEDa\u2019s claims regarding recent criminal
    and pirate activity General Filmir responded that, \u201CRepublic Fleet forces
    are dedicated to the defense of our people first and foremost. Kam\xED D\xEDa
    has no interest in defending those people, only in living out a twisted warrior
    mythos entirely divorced from the truth of Minmatar history.\u201D\n\nDespite
    the General\u2019s warning, a number of military service members have gone absent
    without leave since the holoreel began to circulate, and there are reports of
    a number of Republic Fleet vessels disappearing. The Scope has received reports
    of Minmatar ships attacking Republic units investigating abyssal phenomena or
    performing research into Triglavian technologies. These forces identify themselves
    as the \u201CAshes of Turnur\u201D, in a reference to an essay in \u201CFrom the
    Flames\u201D in which Kam\xED D\xEDa uses ash as a metaphor for a culture born
    out of great destruction saying, \u201CAsh cannot be bound, it is not consumed
    by the flames but flourishes in their aftermath\u201D. \n\n![rep fleet capitals
