    Seyllin I, in which President Foiritan implores the people of Metal City and Loadcore
    to \"not wait where you are to be rescued\" and to \"use the magrail system to
    move yourself to safety.\" Both cities were on the day side of the planet when
    the solar radiological pulse struck, and neither is approachable by dropship.
    \  \n  \nAccording to Federation Navy officials, the rescue effort is \"going
    as well as can be expected\" given the constraint of having limited landing sites.
    An estimated quarter-million people have been evacuated thus far.  \n  \nFederation
    census officials have stated that the total population of Seyllin I is estimated
    to be over half a billion people."
