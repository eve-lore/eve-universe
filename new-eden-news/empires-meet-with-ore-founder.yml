- body: Representatives from the four empires yesterday met with Orion Mashel, founder
    of the ORE Syndicate, along with key ORE administrative personnel at an undisclosed
    location somewhere in the Outer Ring region. The subject of their meeting was
    ORE's recent announcement that come November 17th, they would commence SCC-market
    retail of starbase components and moon mining tools previously available only
    to empire governments and megacorporations.  According to reliable reports, empire
    representatives were adamant in stating that the proposed retailing of these items
    would serve to give even more power to an already disproportionately powerful
    segment of the population, and would furthermore hamper financial empire interests
    by denying them sole rights to the technology such as they have enjoyed up to
    this point.  ORE administration representatives were equally adamant, however,
    in stating that the move to retail these items was a significant step forward
    for the interstellar community, countering the empire representatives' concerns
    with their stated belief that these items would lead to a mass migration of capsuleers
    from empire-controlled territories, leaving the empires' economies safe from the
    massive condensation of wealth - and subsequent economic troubles -- commonly
    found where prolific capsuleers set up camp.  The meeting ended with no discernible
    conclusion, but according to an inside source the consensus among empire representatives
    was that if the Syndicate would put its own financial interests above the general
    welfare of the interstellar community, other measures would have to be taken.  More
    on this as it develops.
