- body: 'BREAKING NEWS - Caldari Navy vessels have made a return to Tamo this evening,
    after claims from Propel Dynamics that their security has been breached. It is
    believed that a number of prototypes and their blueprints have been stolen in
    a raid that saw security checkpoints flooded with non-lethal nerve gas and scientists
    incapacitated.


    The station affected, which is still believed to be holding [SPC] Seeadler, the
    Serpentis Corporation vessel that was impounded by the Caldari Navy twenty four
    days ago, remains on partial lockdown whilst the Caldari Navy and State Marines
    assess the situation.


    The Scope has however learned from sources within Propel Dynamics that the missing
    equipment and blueprints may be related to hardware reverse engineered from the
    Serpentis Corporation vessel, with most of the labs surrounding the hangar in
    which the vessel is believed to be stored having been ransacked.


    An initial statement, released directly from the office of Propel Dynamics CEO
    Ienashi Hurtoken, describes the incident as "deliberate corporate espionage, specifically
    targeting a new prototype technology that Propel Dynamics was preparing to demonstrate
    publicly for the first time in the coming days".


    Both the Caldari Navy and Propel Dynamics have refused to comment further on the
    incident, and while the station''s public hangars remain open to capsuleer and
    trade traffic, Propel Dynamics corporate decks remain in a state of full lockdown.'
