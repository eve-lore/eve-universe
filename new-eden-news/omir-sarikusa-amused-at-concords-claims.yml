    claims of having identified Doriam II\u2019s assassins with scorn, \u201CI find
    it hard to believe that the notoriously incompetent DED investigators managed
    to solve this \u2018mystery\u2019 in such a short time\u201D he said during a
    short subspace transmission.   \n  \nSarikusa continued, \u201CThis shows yet
    again the false ways of the Empire. They\u2019re obviously losing control. Fearing
    upheaval at the lack of news on the matter, the Council decided to broadcast this
    blatant lie to maintain its meagre power.\u201D   \n  \nProbed about the recent
    Blood Raider retreat in Delve space, he commented, \u201CIt was part of a reorganization
    plan we put in motion long ago. From here we\u2019ll be able to plan even more
    devastating attacks on our enemies. With the Empire headless, as it is now, there
    will be no more obstacles on our path.\u201D   \n  \nDED officials tried to trace
    the source of the transmission, but all their efforts came to a halt just outside
    Khanid Space. Amarr Navy officials dismissed Sarikusa\u2019s claims as \u201CMeaningless
    threats after their utter defeat in Sahtogas, the citizens of our glorious Empire
    need not to worry anymore about them\u201D."
