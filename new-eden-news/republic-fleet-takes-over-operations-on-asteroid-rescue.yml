- body: 'Aset - The Republic Fleet has signaled that is has taken operational control
    over rescue operations at the asteroid mine in Aset today and it''s first act
    was to enact a full blackout of communications leaving the site.


    The Fleet already had a strong presence at the site, providing security and specialist
    teams to assist in the rescue.  The Tribal Liberation Force, the Republics capsuleer
    militia, had also been requested to provide additional system security during
    rescue operations.


    The last communication from the site was a report filed by Khalial Vik, stating
    that his team thought they had found the source of the equipment disruption and
    that it seemed to be emanating from the asteroid core itself.   Attempts were
    underway to see if they could nullify the effects and determine their cause.


    The Fleet has yet to give an explanation for this move.'
