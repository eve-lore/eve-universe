- body: 'YULAI - The Directive Enforcement Department has recently completed initial
    investigations into the Sleeper drones designated as "Circadian Seekers" and concluded
    that they are in the process of adapting to perceived threats. We believe this
    process is well advanced and are issuing an emergency advisory under the provisions
    of the Yulai Convention.


    We especially urge capsuleers not to become alarmed by changes in the behavior
    of these drones. We recommend that all pilots exercise caution when approaching
    Circadian Seekers and are sufficiently prepared for retaliation.


    Please report any unusual activity to the lawful authorities or your local DED
    liaison office.'
