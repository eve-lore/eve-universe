- body: 'Rens, Heimatar - At a joint security conference today between officers of
    the Republic Fleet and caravan masters of the Thukker Tribe, it was announced
    that some of the newly-established trade routes between the Great Wildlands and
    Republic space are under increasing threat from pirate activity. Concern has been
    heightened by intelligence that suggests these pirates are mainly ''breakaway''
    elements of the Angel Cartel.


    ''It is clear that pirates and criminals in general wish to take advantage of
    the opportunities they see as afforded by the renewed ties and flow of commerce
    between the Republic and our Thukker brothers,'' said Talon Commander Wylf Orshakor
    of Republic Fleet Naval Intelligence. ''Inevitably, the Angel Cartel plays a large
    role in this criminal and terrorist activity. However, it has become known to
    us that a significant number of Angel raiders have broken away from the main Cartel
    organization. We believe the Cartel''s retreat from Skarkon is in part responsible
    for this split.''


    ''Whatever the reason may be, it is a dispute between thugs and criminals. Our
    only concern is that this splinter faction may behave even more violently and
    senselessly than the Cartel itself. We urge all independent traders and travellers
    to take additional steps to improve their security arrangements on the outlying
    trade routes. Those using transports provided by our Thukker brothers are assured
    that security is a priority.''


    Other sources suggest there is more to the breakaway raiders than mere disagreement
    with the Angel Cartel. An underworld figure calling himself ''Burned Wing'' has
    revealed that ''the splinter factions are Angels who wanted to return to the Minmatar
    people after the Elders revealed themselves. The Reppies turned them away and
    the Thukker shot down some of their ships. The Cartel weren''t going to take them
    back. So now they raid against everyone.'''
