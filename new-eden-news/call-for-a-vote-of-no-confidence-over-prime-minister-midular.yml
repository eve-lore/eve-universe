    of Minmatar freedom fighters who have been fighting and dying for the cause for
    years now. \n\nTo them, the slave farms run by their own countrymen are even worse
    than Amarr slavery. A betrayal of this magnitude serves to eliminate all that
    they have worked for. \n\n\"Prime minister Karan Midular no longer represents
    our people.\" said **Makkar** , veteran warrior of the Oracle tribe, earlier today
    during a rare interview. \n\n\"We would have a stronger leader in the tribal halls.
    One who will stand up for what the vast majority of Minmatar strive for - The
    final emancipation of all Minmatar and indeed all slaves of any race. That she
    has apparently made no reported comment on the finding of these slave farms right
    on our doorstep, so to speak, is absolutely unforgivable.\" \n\nWhen asked to
    what lengths they would to to unseat the PM, he responded simply: \"Should the
    vote fail, or be ignored by the government, I would advocate a more direct approach
    to resolving the issue. However, I would fall well short of anything that might
    plunge the republic into civil war.\" \n\nThe PM has yet to respond to these news,
    but a spokesperson from the PM's office said that such a vote would be taken very
    seriously, no matter whether it actually went through or not."
