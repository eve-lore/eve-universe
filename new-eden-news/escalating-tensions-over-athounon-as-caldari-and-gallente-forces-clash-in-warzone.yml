    naval and militia forces have clashed in Athounon and nearby systems in Placid
    following extraordinary calls for action issued by military authorities of the
    two interstellar powers. Mobilization of navy forces, together with specific orders
    and rules of engagement, appear aimed at contesting control of the Athounon system
    as the highest priority for each empire in the Caldari-Gallente militia warzone.\n\n![CalNavOrder1](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/5xvagsbLpF808mCXvJJV3m/9e368dead030c64713468af4dcb9122c/CalNavOrder1.png)\n*Above:
    Orders to State Protectorate militia from Caldari Navy General*\n\nTwo days ago,
    the Caldari Chief Executive Panel issued a general order to the State Protectorate
    miltia forces putting a priority on holding the Athounon system and the surrounding
    Serthoulde constellation. After an emergency meeting of the Federal Security Council,
    President Celes Aguard, in her capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Gallente
    Federation's military, authorized a response that ordered the Federal Defense
    Union militia to mount a counter-offensive on Caldari-occupied Athounon as a priority
    target.\n\nThese extraordinary developments followed the discovery of a secret
    EDENCOM station orbiting the storm planet of Athounon V, apparently revealed due
    to a failing cloaking device. The most recent reports from Athounon V indicate
    the station's cloaking device has now completely failed. Caldari Navy forces have
    been maintaining a constant guard over the facility, with patrol forces sighted
    moving from planet to planet across the system.\n\n![FedNavOrder1](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/3IUkUfOxhONXzdDZls27DW/64991131e3b8d0f41824651ce1aaccc6/FedNavOrder1.png)\n*Above:
    Orders to Federal Defense Union militia from Gallente Navy Admiral*\n\nSince yesterday's
    Gallente response, reports of Federation Navy scout units clashing with the Caldari
    Navy in Athounon have mounted. The presence of the Triglavian Collective in some
    force has been noted as a complicating factor with some alarm by observers and
    commentators across New Eden. EDENCOM's Provost Marshal Kasiha Valkanir has reportedly
    been summoned to a meeting with CONCORD's military leadership, recalling the EDENCOM
    supreme commander from a tour of fortress systems in the Amarr Empire and Ammatar
    Mandate.\n\n![Athounon V EDENCOM Station](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/edencom_stn_athounon_v.png)\n*Above:
    Reported EDENCOM station in orbit of Athounon V*\n\n### Triglavian Activity in
    Athounon\n\nIt was [reported some months ago](44enyS5kNLZOK6ngvw2GCM#news-in-brief)
    that Triglavian forces had been encountered on the surface of the temperate planet
    Athounon VI by Federal Marines units garrisoned there as part of the planetary
    defense forces.\n\n[Further reports](5EUF95wGl86L5mUo7Jrmmh) since then indicated
    that Federal Marines had engaged Triglavian units identified as Veles Clade \"raiding
    in force\" on Athounon VI. The Scope has learned from Federation military experts
    that this Veles raid was repelled and further units of Federal Marines sent to
    bolster the planetary garrison.\n\n[Subsequent developments](1srMmrT28MHHge9xXzZ0I0)
    indicated that a Triglavian presence had been detected on the surface of the two
    storm planets of Athounon \u2014 planets IV and V \u2014 and that this was believed
    likely to be a Veles Clade occupation of some kind. EDENCOM's AEGIS deployment
    to Athounon refused to comment on the matter and it appears the organization was
    involved in establishing the hidden outpost in orbit of Athounon V.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/yulai_concord_hq.png)
    \ \n_Above: CONCORD HQ, Yulai System_\n\n### Diplomatic Tensions at CONCORD\n\nTriglavian
    forces routinely raid into so-called \"Minor Victory\" systems where their forces
    prevailed but did not initiate stellar harvesting activity. The \"Big 4\" empires,
    CONCORD, and the EDENCOM military alliance have often been at odds as to the best
    way to proceed in the face of uncertainty over Triglavian capabilities combined
    with their demonstrable technological lead in a number of fields. Sources within
    EDENCOM and CONCORD have spoken of serious disputes between different branches
    of the organizations, while diplomatic and intelligence chatter has suggested
    that all empires have made some form of overture to one or other of the Triglavian
    clades.\n\nThe aftermath of the Triglavian Invasion, together with a serious of
    border conflicts, diplomatic crises, and technology thefts, has ratcheted tensions
    between the four great powers to perhaps their greatest levels since the formation
    of the militia warzones in YC110. Certainly, CONCORD conflict monitors and a number
    of experts on interstellar law have been alarmed by the willingness of both the
    Caldari State and the Gallente Federation to suspend aspects of the Yulai Accords
    and Convention in the Athounon system.\n\nCONCORD Inner Circle President Seri
    Okonaya is reported to be contemplating recourse to an emergency meeting of the
    full CONCORD Assembly amidst an apparent logjam at the interstellar organization's
    executive council. One source has indicated to the Scope that all empire delegates
    have returned to their respective governments and the Inner Circle's CONCORD members
    are experiencing \"difficulties in establishing a framework for further discussion
    with national governments.\"\n\n### News in Brief\n\n- Federation Navy Vice Admiral
