- body: "Although mere conjecture until recent hours, numerous credible yet confidential
    sources have confirmed that diplomatic ties between the ORE and the Mordus Legion
    have deteriorated to a breaking point.   \n  \nThe relationship between the two
    powers over recent months has proven to be strained with a commonly held view
    that the source of the friction has arisen from disputes between the two faction
    leaders. Both Orion Mashel, founder of the Outer Ring Excavations Company, and
    Muryia Mordu, the leader of Mordu's Legion Mercenary Corporation, have had a history
    of public personal conflict, a factor that may prove to be the source of the recent
    sudden drop in mutual co-operation.   \n  \nThe source of the hostilities remains
    a mystery with no official comment regarding either groups standing to the other,
    but it is believed to be due to feelings within the Legion regarding apparent
    stagnation at the hands of continued service to ORE.   \n  \nAlready reports have
    been issued by members of the pod pilot community regarding the amassing of Mordus
    Legion in critical ORE locations upon the Eastern flank of ORE systems. Although
    not outwardly aggressive the movement of Mordus Legion personnel and assets to
    central locations has sparked a deep-rooted concern within the local populace.
    \  \n  \nWe shall bring you more information as the situation develops."
