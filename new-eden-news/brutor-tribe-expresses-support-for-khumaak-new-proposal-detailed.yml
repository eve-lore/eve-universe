- body: "At a Tribal Council session yesterday afternoon Wkumi Pol, head of the Brutor
    Tribe, announced that after much deliberation the tribe has decided to put all
    their weight behind supporting the Khumaak\u2019s cause. Citing in his statement
    \u201Cour devoted brethren\u2019s tireless advocacy of the traditions so dear
    to us and the callous response their commitment has garnered from members of the
    ruling class\u201D as the main reasons for the decision, Pol then went on to detail
    a proposal for compromise, a fifteen-page document that has reportedly had top
    Brutor officials working day and night for the last week to formulate and finalize.
    \  \n  \nThe Brutor proposal calls for the Khumaak to be kept on the official
    list of sanctioned Minmatar state, military and fleet apparel while detailing
    an exhaustive list of exceptional circumstances in which the weapon can not be
    openly displayed, including among other things official Amarr diplomatic gatherings
    and trans-empire summits. Many have pointed out that the proposal\u2019s wording
    never explicitly states that the weapon must be absent from said gatherings --
    merely that it must not be openly displayed. This has prompted voices of criticism
    from within both the Sebiestor and Krusual tribes; according to Sebiestor council
    member Atuor Turvan, the proposal is \u201Ctoo mealy-mouthed to be taken seriously
    by any legislative body.\u201D   \n  \nTurvan\u2019s outspokenness on the issue
    does not, however, seem to be shared by many of his tribe\u2019s leaders. Most
    notably, PM Karin Midular, Sebiestor\u2019s tribal head, has opted to remain virtually
    silent on the issue until a thorough evaluation of the proposal at hand has been
    completed. Analysts are interpreting this as a watershed moment in the debate;
    for the first time since the initial ban motion was put forth, both sides have
    ceased screaming at each other long enough to take stock of the current situation,
    and hopes are high that the Brutors\u2019 increased involvement is the first step
    towards a possible amicable solution in what has been one of the most fiery debates
    in Minmatar political history."
