    into the wormhole, following CreoDron's discovery of civilization in that area
    of space.   \n  \nAccording to reports, the SSoE discovered a wormhole in an unidentified

    of these wormholes, then it is imperative that we approach with even more caution
    than before,\" said a SSoE spokesperson. \"We do not know if these structures
    are inhabited or abandoned, nor do we know the disposition of the civilization
    that built them.\"  \n  \nThe Sisters are taking several top diplomats, linguists,
    and scientists in an effort to make peaceful contact with any possible inhabitants
    in the wormhole space. In addition to the scientific vessels, Mordu's Legion escort
    ships will accompany the expedition in the event that the structures are inhabited
    by hostile entities. \"We are taking every effort to protect our people. We will
    go in with an open heart, but ready arms.\"  \n  \nThe Sisters expect to launch
    the expedition within the next few days, and they will provide updates as they
    come."
