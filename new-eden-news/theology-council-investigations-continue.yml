- body: "Acol Yarwema, Chief Operative of the Theology Council, issued a statement
    yesterday regarding the recent attacks on Theology Council assets. He announced
    that the Council's ongoing investigation into the attacks, including the interrogation
    of two recently apprehended pilots, has confirmed earlier suspicions regarding
    the identity and intentions of those responsible. The statement did not name the
    suspected attackers. \n\nAcol continued, \"It is certain the capture of these
    suspects, aided by capsuleers loyal to our great Empire, will advance our investigations
    considerably. No doubt the true instigators of these attacks are working through
    third parties in an attempt to hide their involvement.\" \n\nAshmod Chieh, spokesperson
    of the Kor-Azor family, released a press statement where the family condemned
    the attacks upon the Theology Council, judging them to be ''immoral and cowardly.''
    The press release further stated that the Kor-Azor family would be willing to
    help in the investigation or send general aid if the Council required it. The
    Theology Council has politely declined the aid of Kor-Azor at this time. \n\nThe
    statement of Kor-Azor comes at a time when the family has been widely criticized
    for the situation within its borders. Reports have filtered through of excessive
    brutality by Kor-Azor police forces. Adding to problems are several proclamations
    by Aritcio Kor-Azor that have been met with increasing disbelief. The most recent
    proclamation stated that any slaver found outside at the same time as Gaius (Aritcio's
    own slaver dog) would have its owner tortured to death, before its eyes, and would
    then be forced to eat the remains of said owner."
