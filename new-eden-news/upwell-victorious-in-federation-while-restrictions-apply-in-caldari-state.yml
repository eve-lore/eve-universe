    Labor-Populists Besmirched as Upwell Transfer Bill Sails Through Senate\n\nVillore,
    Essence - The Gallente Federation Senate has passed a bill allowing Upwell workforce
    transfers within the Federation. The bill was passed by an overwhelming majority
    thanks to support from both Progressive Union and Federalist Liberals. President
    Aguard, a vocal proponent of the new transfers, welcomed the results as \u201Ca
    victory for the public good.\u201D\n\nThe Labor-Populists opposed Upwell\u2019s
    workforce contracts but were unable to secure cross-party support for their position.
    The New Sociocrats and Intaki Autonomists both abstained from the vote despite
    initial signs of opposition to the transfers. Villore insiders have informed the
    Scope that the two parties were keen to distance themselves from the Labor-Populists
    following their recent controversy.\n\nOver the last few weeks, Labor-Populists
    have come under fire for their past associations with Thibauld Tailler, the outspoken
    leader of the Gallentia Primacy. The Primacy has been in the news recently following
    a failed attack on Intaki Prime. A former senator and Labor-Populist party member,
    Tailler, was removed from the party for his Ultranationalist views. The party
    has denounced Tailler and condemned the Primacy, but this has been undercut by
    recently circulated holoreels of party members endorsing Tailler for the senate.
    The endorsements predate the FIO\u2019s discovery of Tallier\u2019s terrorist
    connections but have damaged the party\u2019s reputation nonetheless.\n\nHow the
    recent embarrassments and Senate defeat will impact the long-term future of the
    party remains to be seen. Whatever the outcome, today marks a significant victory
    for the Progressive Union and Upwell.\n\n![Executive Panel](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/6HRs34xEkr8n5628fysWGA/98c3e400b5f0e703b8828ac9dcd06998/executive_panel.png)\n\n###
    Chief Executive Panel Allows Restricted Upwell Transfers\n\nNew Caldari, The Forge
    - The Chief Executive Panel has voted 5 to 3 in favor of allowing Upwell transfers,
    albeit under strict conditions. The megacorporations voted along faction lines,
    with the Forest Faction voting in favor and the Ocean Faction voting against.
    The vote was passed thanks to a last-minute decision by the Mountain Faction to
    support the transfers. \n\nThe Mountain Faction, which consists of the Sukuuvestaa
    and Kaalakiota megacorporations, has long been associated with security and stability
    within the State. Following a meeting between Sukuuvestaa and Upwell executives
    last week, the faction presented the Panel with an amended proposal. The new proposal
    included additional restrictions on transfers granting greater control to Caldari
    corporations and the State. \n\nThe amended proposal includes the right to deny
    transfers on the basis of active corporation interests or State reservation requirements.
    This gives a transfer applicant's current corporation the right to block a workforce
    transfer if they deem the individual necessary to their operations. It also allows
    the State to deny the transfer of individuals it considers important to State
    interests, and to limit transfers to ensure a sufficient pool of reserves is available
    for future services to the State.\n\nThe decision has been regarded by economic
    analysts as a loss for the Ocean Faction but only a pyrrhic victory for the Forest
    Faction. Akimaka Saraki, Chairman of the Chief Executive Panel, told the press
    at an announcement on New Caldari that \u201Cstability is achieved when two sides
    apply equal pressure, and compromise is won when neither side can claim a true
    victory.\u201D\n\n### News In Brief\n- EDENCOM reports suspicious redeployment
