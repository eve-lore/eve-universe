- body: Earlier today the Inner Circle of CONCORD was in session, anxiously waiting
    for a rare visit from the Amarr Emperor. Heideran VII was intended to make a speech
    at the meeting, outlining his plans for maintaining the current status quo of
    peace and harmony. Thus it came as a great surprise when it was Imperial Chamberlain
    Karsoth that took the podium in place of the emperor. His speech was dry and dense,
    with little in the way of new information being relayed. No explanation was given
    to why the emperor failed to show up and the Amarrian delegation quickly left
    CONCORD headquarters as soon as the session was over.
