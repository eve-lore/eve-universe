- body: "Following the retreat of Caldari and Gallente forces from the Crielere system,
    security in the system is at an all time low. A distress call was received from
    the skeleton crew still at the station, claiming that Guristas pirate ships were
    circling the compound. The scientists at Crielere fear that pirate forces may
    choose to storm the facilities, as they are left defenseless in the eye of the
    political storm that has spun from the research lab.   \n  \nNeither Caldari nor
    Gallente military officials agreed to comment on whether they would come to the
    aid of top scientists Henric Touvolle and Taromi Umailen. Military ships could
    be spotted leaving the system, silently ignoring the distress calls of this former
    jewel of cross-racial scientific achievement. Several passers-by engaged the Guristas
    ships and seemed to be successful in eliminating most of the threat for now, but
    more pirate ships are expected.   \n  \nThe scientific community in both Caldari
    space and Gallente space is thought to be preparing requests for official military
    intervention and the safe return of the scientists to their home. If their respective
    militaries would agree to such a plan, it is still unknown whether Touvolle and
    Umailen would agree to leave their beloved research lab, as it is certain it would
    come to complete ruin once totally unmanned."
