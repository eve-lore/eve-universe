- body: "Luminaire \u2013 Stating that \"all other options have failed\", President
    Foiritan declared a state of martial law on Caldari Prime. The order sets an enforceable
    curfew on all Caldari expatriates, requiring them to stay in their homes within
    established \"expatriate zones\". Reports from the surface indicate that Federation
    municipal police have resorted to deadly force in \"numerous\" incidents already,
    with casualty numbers estimated to be \"in the hundreds\". Police are also actively
    blockading Caldari neighborhoods in the metropolis cities of Tovil and Arcurio,
    surrounding them with barriers and effectively isolating the entire Caldari population
    of the planet into segregated pockets. \n\n\"We have exhausted all other means
    of quelling the violence,\" President Foiritan stated. \"Martial law is a last
    resort to protect those who want nothing to do with the bigotry plaguing our nations.
    But it appears there are some individuals who are determined to spread as much
    mayhem as possible, and I hold Tibus Heth directly responsible for inciting it.
    We have repeatedly stated that the Malkalen disaster was a rogue act. And though
    we may never know the reasons for Admiral Noir\u2019s actions, what we do now
    will define how our nations move forward. I implore all of you on Caldari Prime,
    and indeed everywhere in both nations, to reconsider any acts of aggression. Our
    wounds will heal, but it is going to take time.\""
