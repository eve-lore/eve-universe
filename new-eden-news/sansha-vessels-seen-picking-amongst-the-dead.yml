- body: "Domain - Numerous reports from fleeing merchant vessels have reported seeing
    unusual activity from local Sansha raiders, commonly seen attacking targets of
    opportunity throughout many of the southern regions of the Empire.\n\nReports
    of Sansha raiding vessels picking amongst the shattered hulls of both Amarr and
    Matari hulls has prompted Amarr Navy command to dispatch a handful of Navy vessels
    to deter the Sansha threat, although a significant proportion of Navy assets has
    remained to eliminate both the Minmatar attackers and the slave uprising. \n\nSpeculation
    from a variety of sources has led to the widely held belief that the bounty of
    freshly fallen crew members has attracted the attention of the usually incoherent
    and mindless drones of the once great Sansha\u2019s fleet."
