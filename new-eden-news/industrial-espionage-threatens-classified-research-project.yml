- body: "CRIELERE \u2013 Concord police vessels quickly destroyed a Kestrel-class
    frigate that forced its way out of the Crielere Research Lab despite a station
    security lockdown. There are unconfirmed reports of gunfire and at least one explosion
    onboard the station immediately prior to the Kestrel\u2019s departure from the
    docking bay. Although the area currently remains off limits to non-essential personnel
    pending the completion of the police investigation, reports are leaking through
    about a botched attempt to steal some of the hyper-secret technology currently
    being developed there. A Concord investigator who did not want to be identified
    stated that the busted heist was both \u201Celaborate in scheme\u201D and \u201Cpositively
    corporation-funded\u201D. He refused to divulge the name of the suspected corporation
    for \u201Creasons that ought to be obvious\u201D and warned not to \u201Cjump
    to conclusions just because the destroyed vessel was of Caldari design.\u201D
    \  \n  \nOften labeled a \u201Cresource drain\u201D by local politicians, the
    joint Caldari-Gallente research project(s) taking place in Crielere have been
    shrouded in a veil of secrecy ever since the much-heralded completion of the lab
    several weeks ago. The complete lack of public access to any of the projects currently
    underway there has been the source of circulating rumors that a military project
    of considerable significance is underway at the facility. It is unknown if this
    latest development will be the cause of any setbacks to the research."
