- body: "Last night, after over a month in hiding, renegade scientists Albert Vance
    and Vic Stats resurfaced in Caldari space to gather supplies and equipment necessary
    to the reconstruction and further development of their failed mind control device.
    \n\nThe fugitive pair appeared in the Isaziwa system of the Imurukka constellation,
    The Citadel region, where they were spotted in open communications channels by
    local pod pilots. Vance began broadcasting over the systems local channel, claiming
    that he knew why the previous device failed during its initial testing sequence
    \u2013 a failure that was clearly responsible for the much diminished state of
    Stats. Vic Stats now appeared to be little more than a drooling idiot, barely
    capable of acting in the capacity of a simple servant. Vance then made a general
    request to all local pilots to supply his work with roughly 5000 units of electronic
    parts, a common interstellar trade item, in order to repair and modify the mind
    control device for further testing. Despite a number of refusals, mainly due to
    pilots aversions to both the man and his work, a few enterprising individuals
    began to ship in electronic parts at a steady rate. \n\nThis, however, was nearly
    undone when members of the CAIN Corporation, noted for their opposition to Vance
    and the mind control program and stationed in the Isaziwa system, attempted to
    stop the freelancing pilots from supplying the scientists. Fortunately for Vance,
    they were not able to do so. After a relatively short amount of time the pair
    were able to move on to an unknown destination, along with their freshly acquired
    supplies, unmolested by authorities.\n\nQuestions now linger over how Vance and
    Stats were so easily able to enter Caldari space, and exit it again with an amount
    of supplies that InterBus is not equipped to carry. Pete Sance \u2013 the Caldari
    Agent and his team, who had been pursuing the scientists across several regions
    of space with warrants for their arrest, has not been seen or heard from in some
    time. Caldari State authorities have refused to provide any comments on either
    question."
