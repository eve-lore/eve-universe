- body: "Hatakani \u2013 Tragedy struck the the Sukuuvestaa station in orbit around
    Hatakani VII-18 today when a storage tank of industrial solvent ruptured in the
    middle of a shift change, killing 57 people and injuring at least 1200 people.
    Industrial facilities on the station have been shut down temporarily while investigators
    assess the damage and hazardous waste teams attempt to deal with the toxic spill,
    and a number of residential areas near the solvent leak have been evacuated as
    a precaution. \n\nThe leak was first detected shortly after noon while the second
    shift was arriving on the job, but according to workers in the facility, it was
    dismissed as a buggy monitor for nearly half an hour. \u201CThe last three days,
    we've been having air quality warnings every thirty minutes. It's been nuts. When
    it started, we all just figured it was another false alarm,\u201D said Juuri Vodruki,
    a smelter operator. \u201CThen a couple people passed out, and the whole tank
    just burst open. Everyone scrambled for the pressure doors, but it was too late
    for a lot of guys.\u201D \n\nFleeing workers reported that some victims were simply
    dissolved completely, and suggested that the number of dead was probably far higher
    than official reports. \u201CI'm not saying the company is lying, but I saw five
    guys not more than twenty meters away from me get covered head to toe in that
    junk, and it was like something out of a horror reel. That was a big tank, and
    I'm pretty sure there's a lot more people who were much closer to it than I was,\u201D
    said a worker who asked not to be identified. \n\nIndustrial facilities at the
    station, which perform a variety of tasks for thirteen different SuVee subsidiaries,
    including Citadel Electronics, Penumbra Aerospace, and Sunny Side Farms, have
    been shut down while Sukuuvestaa investigators pore over the scene and hazmat
    teams deal with the mess. \u201CInitial findings are pointing towards an improper
    mixture within the solvent itself,\u201D said Terese Oriita, the SuVee spokeswoman
    at the station. \u201CThis weakened the inner seal of the containment vessel and
    caused the leak. We have already begun the process of tracing back the supplier
    of the solvent.\u201D \n\nAccording to several of the local dockworkers, however,
    that process may not be as straightforward as SuVee may hope. Traffic is extremely
    heavy in the Hatakani system, which is a major stop along trade routes from the
    Caldari State's core systems to those of the Federation, and the day of the accident
    was an unusually busy one even so. \u201CWe had almost two hundred different freighters,
    industrials, and transports docking here during the hour they're looking at,\u201D
    said assistant dockmaster Tcheky Sumisen. \u201CIt's going to be a complete mess
    tracing that back.\u201D \n\n\u201CA problem like this should never have happened,\u201D
    said Ichiro Kemisaisen, professor of chemical engineering at the School of Applied
    Knowledge. \u201CChemical transport systems are carefully keyed to prevent exactly
    this problem, and they are double-checked both at loading and unloading. The only
    way this could have happened is through a failure of those safeties, something
    that is almost impossible under normal circumstances.\u201D When asked he was
    suggesting this accident was due to sabotage, he told us that \u201Cthere's no
    way to be sure, but that does seem to be the likeliest possibility.\u201D"
