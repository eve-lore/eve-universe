    Confirmation that the Ducia Foundry team deployed to Annaro system included slave
    workers emerged last night, sparking controversy and overshadowing the successful
    rescue of 176 miners from the collapsed CBD Corporation asteroid mine. The Caldari
    Business Tribunal is reported to have been alerted by individuals within the Annaro
    police; they are investigating allegations that corporate and civil codes were
    broken by the local police corporation.\n\nAccording to reports, the rescue team
    included 16 slaves, who carried out dangerous work on the surface of the asteroid.
    Those slaves have since been purchased and released by Amarr Holder Aszhar Freimala,
    in accordance with an agreement between Freimala, Ducia Foundry, and Annaro police
    commander Garr Diymir. Despite this agreement, the venture was still illegal under
    Caldari law, as the individuals in question were slaves during the rescue operation.\n\nSources
    within the Annaro police force have alleged that Commander Diymir gave his authority
    for the illegal venture to proceed and ordered several police patrols to change
    course away from the Amarr team's ships and the asteroid. Tribunal investigators
    are interviewing senior officers in the Annaro police corporation. Commander Diymir
    is reported to have been suspended from duty, though he is cooperating with investigators.
    With the investigation appearing to be aimed at prosecuting Garr Diymir, local
    miners have begun a fund to help pay for his legal costs."
