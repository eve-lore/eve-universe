- body: "Only minutes ago with the Elder-led taskforce in full retreat, camera drones
    on scene in the system fed live footage as elements of the fleet pulled away from
    the task force and positioned themselves around the stargate while the rest of
    the taskforce continued its rapid retreat. \n\nLed by ships with the markings
    of the rebel Minmatar faction known as the Defiants, the holding force immediately
    began to engage the lead elements of the pursuing Imperial fleet as they arrived
    through the Stargate in force. \n\nAs the Defiant forces began to engage in a
    bitter close-range firefight, cynosural fields flared, marking the entrance of
    a Hel Mothership to the field flanked by dual Carrier escorts. Footage was briefly
    suspended as the electromagnetic resonance from the fields interfered with the
    camera drones. \n\nWhen the stream was re-established less than a minute, the
    screen was filled with the startling images of one Nidhoggur carrier slowly breaking
    in half under the fire of countless laser beams as fast moving attack ships swirled
    around it in brutal firefights with their Imperial counterparts. The chaotic pictures
    were set against the backdrop of multiple Imperial cynosural fields opening, swiftly
    followed by the arrival of an entire Capital squadron including two Aeon-class
    Motherships. \n\nWith even more cynosural fields opening the way for further reinforcements,
    the few camera drones stationed around the stargate began to malfunction. The
    last, heavily-distorted images of the stream depict the Hel Mothership with multiple
    hull breaches and major fires spreading across its decks as it came under concentrated
    fire from the entire capital squadron. As the surviving Defiant ships sped past
    in support, the Hel painfully realigned itself on a vector towards the heart of
    the Imperial Capital formation. \n\nThe entire scene lasted not more than 2 minutes
    before transmission was finally terminated. Imperial forces are once again reported
    to be moving in full pursuit of the main Minmatar force. No trace of surviving
    Defiant forces has been reported. \n\n_Posted 16:53 GMT_"
