- body: "After it was revealed that Crielere was missing important blueprints, rumors
    about their whereabouts have been spreading like wildfire. Who could have taken
    them? Who has them?   \n  \nSpeculation that they might have been stolen by a
    low ranking researcher, only to be sold to a discreet agent of one of the big
    corporations, has been voiced - in particular by those who have been running the
    errands of said agents.   \n  \nIn particular, this news should be interesting
    to the smaller corporations, who have little or no chance to compete with the
    likes of Ishukone. Entire new product lines might appear out of seemingly nowhere
    if said blueprints find their ways into the hands of a capable researcher - and
    that would surely invigorate the market, which all experts agree is in a slump.
    \  \n  \nExciting times ahead, indeed."
