    \"Read the previous article.\"), the Caldari scientist Hilen Tukoss appeared to
    have defected to the Minmatar Republic along with hundreds of his research staff.
    Speculation about his intentions was put to an end a short while ago, when Tukoss
    formally joined with Eifyr & Co. He spoke with The Scope only a few hours before
    joining Eifyr to explain why he had left the Caldari State.\n\n \n\n_Feature article
    by Juralen Kaala_ __\n\nIt's after 9pm when I arrive at my destination in Metropolis.
    I'm surprised to have found a direct shuttle out to Eram so late, but the captain
    tells me all of the crews with Eifyr & Co. docking licenses are pulling extra
    hours. Business has picked up, he says.\n\nThis would be because only a short
    while ago, one of Zainou's scientists, a man by the name of Hilen Tukoss, decided
    to load up a Charon freighter with a lifetime's worth of research and disappear
    to the other side of the State-Republic border with it. Tukoss' freighter (he
    calls it the Arek'jaalan) had more than just scientific documents and materials,
    however. Also aboard was his entire research team.\n\nThis much The Scope has
    learned from other reports, and although they remain unconfirmed, I quickly learn
    that the rumors are true when I arrive at his personal quarters.\n\nInside I am
    met by Tukoss and at least ten other people; a Deteis, some Civire and Achura.
    They smile as I enter, but then quickly return to the work laid out before them
    on dozens of monitors that fill the room. Each screen shows the view of a Charon
    from a different angle.\n\nWithout a word, Tukoss walks me past the monitors to
    the hangar balcony. Staring out I can start to see the whole picture. A Charon
    is being slowly and carefully gutted, and then rebuilt from the inside out. Hundreds
    of people are crawling over the hull like insects as they weave in and out of
    view. Working calmly and yet with a great sense of purpose, I can see them directing
    teams of M-TACs, and overseeing countless nanoassembly arrays as they tear something
    down, or build something new.\n\nOne might expect to see a Zainou scientist installing
    research facilities and reconfiguring the majestic grey expanse before me into
    some kind of scientific forward operating base. I certainly expect to see as much.\n\nInstead,
    however, I see a lake being slowly filled with water. Soil and plants being laid.
    Homes, distinctly Caldari, slowly taking form in a ring around the water. It all
    looks like a small Caldari suburb, except it's inside a Charon.\n\nNot a word
    has been said, but Tukoss seems to have already answered a few of the lingering
    questions. He's come here with others, clearly, and from the way they are building
    homes as if they have been planning it all their lives, they intend to stay.\n\nWalking
    back into the quarters, we take a seat to begin the interview. Tukoss speaks freely
    the whole time, despite any number of individuals coming and going through the
    area. It seems anything Tukoss has to say to me, he is comfortable sharing with
    whoever else has chosen to follow him. Perhaps it is an intentional divorce from
    the management style he left behind, but then, there are more important questions
    to ask. I begin with the obvious.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\n\"I came here due to
    a disagreement,\" Tukoss begins to explain. \"Zainou's research efforts in certain
    areas have become exclusively focused on applied science.\"\n\nI ask Tukoss why
    he has such a disregard for applied science. I can tell from the way everyone
    present in the room turns to watch for his answer that it's one of those questions
    you never ask the boss, if Tukoss can even be called that.\n\n\"Because it's a
    meaningless term. To understand why, you have to take a wider perspective. Applied
    science? All science can be applied, eventually.\"\n\nMore important, he adds,
    is that the increasing focus on \"commodification and weaponization\" constitutes
    a threat to \"the sense of discovery that lies at the core of science.\"\n\nReluctant
    to focus on anything specific in his railings against a vaguely-defined \"scientific
    community,\" Tukoss almost seems unsure himself why he came here, or at least
    unwilling to revisit the issue. Perhaps he is just waiting for the right tactical
    moment to spill the sordid details, but from the way the subject strains the atmosphere,
    it feels closer to a victim's reluctance to revisit the trauma.\n\nIt is hard
    to tell exactly where the Deteis scientist is going. Perhaps he is even playing
    it all as it comes, but then his next steps seem as carefully organized as the
    procession of scientists behind us.\n\n\"First, we have to lay foundations,\"
    he says, gesturing back over to the Charon. \"Then we have to reach out to the
    capsuleer community.\n\n\"What I see, in my research, is a conspiracy of apathy
    towards true investigative science. When it comes to the study of wormhole space,
    the capsuleers are the only ones really achieving anything.\"\n\nSo this is about
    wormhole space and the Sleepers? The Deteis just nods this time. I leave him plenty
    of room to add to the answer, but he won't be drawn.\n\nWe move on to Eifyr &
    Co. - the Krusual-backed biotech company that invites just as much speculation
    and rumor as its Caldari counterpart. Tukoss' choice to leave one infamous workplace
    for another suggests that he still intends to continue research at the cutting
    edge.\n\n\"Eifyr has long held my respect,\" Tukoss admits. \"Their approach to
    research is very different to ours. The best way I've heard it put to me is that
    they'll find answers first, and then start looking - very broadly - for problems
    they can fix with them. So they might say, for example: We think this material
    has many valuable properties, so we intend to research it. When they discover
    something new about it, they will then start thinking about what applications
    it could have, if any, and then return to discover anything else they can. It's
    a wholly different approach.\n\n\"It's kind of like that old stereotype about
    Minmatar ships being held together by duct tape. There's a kernel of truth to
    every stereotype, and here it would be that Minmatar scientists and engineers
    are very good at finding a hundred uses for the same thing. So for them, applied
    science is less important. They can often get more out of one discovery than we
    can get out of a dozen.\"\n\nEffusive in his praise for his new hosts, it's hard
    not to notice the similarities between Tukoss' enthusiasm and that of Minmatar
    refugees beginning their new life in the Federation and Republic. He gives the
    impression of someone who has come home, a scientist who has been set free. When
    he talks about the past, it's mostly in the context of how much better he thinks
    the future can be.\n\nOur time is running low, so before things end I decide to
    let him know what's coming with that capsuleer outreach idea of his. They are
    going to want to know more, I explain; about his research, about his old life
    in the State, and about the Sleepers. Is he ready to open those floodgates?\n\n\"I
    doubt anyone could be,\" he says. \"I suspect though, that I will lean more on
    them than the other way around. As for the questions they'll ask, it's a difficult
    situation at times, yes. What do you say when a known Sansha loyalist asks about
    your research? If you turn him away, how do you know he won't just send someone
    less obvious to get the information? Trust in the capsuleer world is a dangerous
    thing, but also essential.\"\n\nWith that, Tukoss rises, extending his hand. \"More
    work remains,\" he offers apologetically. On our way out, he stops me at the door,
    and takes his turn to ask a question, but this one is obviously rhetorical.\n\n\"Do
    you know what our problem is? We can measure success and failure, but we can never
    measure lost opportunity.\"\n\nTukoss offers a genuine smile as the door closes
    between us. I make my way back into the station lobby, past the throng of reporters,
    hecklers and well-wishers, and back on to one of the many shuttles that brought
    them here."
