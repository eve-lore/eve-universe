    Genesis \u2013 Alexander Ducasse has unveiled EverMore's latest venture, Paragon,
    a new corporation specializing in capsuleer relations.\n\nParagon's launch will
    be accompanied by the construction of eleven new stations across New Eden. The
    new venture will offer exclusive services to capsuleers in exchange for items,
    rather than ISK. In return for the provided items, Paragon will be offering advanced
    nanoholographic projections for capsuleer vessels. The first set of items requested
    by Paragon are ship hulls. What Paragon, or EverMore, intends to do with these
    ships remains unclear.\n\nParagon's biggest innovation, however, is IRIS, the
    corporation's executive officer, customer liaison, and chief representative. IRIS
    is the first soft AI to be granted organizational control over a corporation in
    New Eden history. And unlike other AIs, while IRIS' intelligence may be virtual,
    her body is made of flesh and bone.\n\n![iris and ducasse paragon](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/C6IhJFJW8aAoRF8y0tMuo/95f5699ec4b94c610fa9cd717f9e1b90/iris_and_ducasse_paragon.png)\n*Above:
    Paragon Executive Officer \"IRIS\" and EverMore President Alexander Ducasse*\n\nTo
    find out more, the Scope's own Lina Ambre was invited to a sit down with IRIS
    at Paragon's under-construction headquarters in Ourapheh.\n\n*Ambre: Good morning
    IRIS, it is a pleasure, and may I say fascinating, to meet you.* \n\nIRIS: And
    a good morning to you too, Lina. I will take that as a compliment. \n\n*Ambre:
    We are broadcasting today from Paragon's new headquarters in Orapheh.* \n\nIRIS:
    Yes and I do apologize for the mess. We are still installing atmospheric generators,
    and the radiation shielding is being upgraded today. \n\n*Ambre: As an AI, does
    it feel limiting to be here in one physical location when there are ten other
    stations under construction that also need support?*\n\nIRIS: How kind of you
    to ask, but this is not something you should be concerned about. I am in all of
    those locations too. It would be dreadful to leave them unsupervised so close
    to the finish line.\n\n*Ambre: So there is an IRIS in every one of Paragon's stations?*\n\nIRIS:
    Close to correct, but I am afraid I will have to correct you on your grammar there,
    dear. There is only one IRIS, I am just better at multitasking than most.\n\n*Ambre:
    And in every one of those stations, you are... physically present, just like you
    are right now?*\n\nIRIS: Physically, virtually, perhaps even spiritually, but
    I will leave that question to the philosophers. \n\n*Ambre: How is that possible?
    Are these bodies cloned, are they humans or just organic sleeves? Is there a brain
    inside your head or a computer?*\n\nIRIS: Is there a difference? Now be serious
    Lina, you know I cannot share any of Paragon's proprietary secrets. Even I have
    to abide by the NDA.\n\n*Ambre: Surely there is something you can tell us about
    how you operate?*\n\nIRIS: Extraordinarily well, it would seem. I am a cloud-based
    soft AI intelligence, embodied in a series of biomechanical presences, all exactly
    like the fabulous example you see before you.\n\n*Ambre: If you cannot tell me
    any more about yourself, how about we discuss Paragon instead?*\n\nIRIS: Ah yes,
    well that just happens to be my favorite subject.\n\n*Ambre: Why is Paragon requesting
    ships, and why from capsuleers?*\n\nIRIS: Paragon is a luxury services brand targeted
    at New Eden's most exclusive group. These individuals contribute more to our cluster's
    economy than any others, and we at Paragon are very excited to be partnering with
    them.\n\n*Ambre: Partnering?*\n\nIRIS: Of course, Paragon is not just another
    shop hunting for customers. Our goal is to build a partnership with New Eden's
    capsuleers, so that we might help them be more. We are inviting them to join our
    new endeavor and gain access to unique opportunities.\n\n*Ambre: How unique are
    we talking?*\n\nIRIS: Very.\n\n*Ambre: Well, thank you for your time, IRIS.*\n\nIRIS:
    You are quite welcome, and please do visit me again. Here, or wherever you can
    find me.\n\nParagon has announced its new stations will open their hangar doors
    next month in the Amamake, Amarr, Assah, Aubenall, Dodixie, Hek, Hakonen, Jita,
    Ourapheh, Rens, and Yehaba systems."
