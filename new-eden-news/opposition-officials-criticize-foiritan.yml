- body: "Villore - In the uneasy calm following CONCORD's call for a cessation of
    hostilities, there are already criticisms being levelled at Gallente President
    Souro Foiritan. \n\nGiven emergency powers by the Gallente Senate as a result
    of that body's declaration of war on the Caldari State, President Foiritan was
    charged with the daunting task of providing leadership to the Federation's military
    forces, still reeling from the surprise Caldari attack. Though many lauded a calm
    and restraint that brought the worst of the fighting to a close quickly, others
    were quick to criticise his actions. \n\n\"Had I known he was going to roll over
    like a cur and concede a planet in our home system to the enemy, I'd never have
    approved giving him emergency powers,\" was the scathing comment made by Matilde
    Chuong-Gennier, a Senator representing a largely Jin-Mei constituency. \n\nSenator
    Chuong-Gennier was perhaps the most vocal, but certainly not alone among Foiritan's
    opponents to make such statements. \"The fact that the Caldari were able to so
    easily bypass our border defenses and develop overwhelming force in Luminaire
    demonstrates a severe intelligence gap and egregious underfunding of key areas,\"
    said Carmen Duvolle, a senior Senate aide. She continued, adding, \"Really, this
    whole debacle demonstrates a failure at all levels of the current administration.\"
    \n\nSenator Mentas Blaque, Foiritan's long-time political opponent, has so far
    remained silent on the issue, and no one on his personal staff was willing to
    publicly comment on the President's decision. \n\nPresident Foiritan is not without
    his supporters, however. Gaven Blalonde, a public policy analyst for Legal Matters
    Incorporated said, \"What would any of these other so-called 'leaders' have done
    differently in his position? Stubborly resisted and allowed Gallente Prime to
    be bombarded to rubble? This kind of criticism is partisan politics at its worst,
    and it comes at a time when we need unity the most.\" \n\nPresident Foiritan is
    scheduled to address the nation shortly."
