    Division at 5ZXX-K officially confirmed what until now was rumor only: Serpentis
    operatives are being actively hunted by Mordu\u2019s forces in the Placid region.
    \  \n  \nNews arrived a few days ago about Serpentis battleships being destroyed
    in conjunction with freelance pod-pilot forces yet no Mordu\u2019s official had
    commented until today.   \n  \n\"A Serpentis Megathron was tracked down to the
    Moclinamaud system by a three man Mordu\u2019s squad under the command of Lt.
    Amlerik Raun,\" confirmed Cmdr. Mayer. \"Lt Raun opted for a careful approach
    to the situation. Retreating to Orvolle he managed to enroll six freelance pilots,
    who were deemed more than enough for the task at hand.\"   \n  \nUpon returning
    to Moclinamaud, all stargates were secured as per standard procedure and the system
    scanned; the available firepower easily disposed the hostile Battleships as soon
    as it was found.\u201D   \n  \nMayer refused to comment on the notorious decrease
    of Mordu\u2019s presence on the Outer Ring sector and/or its effect on Serpentis
    activity in the region; no other Mordu official was available for comment."
