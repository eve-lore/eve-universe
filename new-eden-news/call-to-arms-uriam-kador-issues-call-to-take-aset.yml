    crusader for our faith, a follower of God's righteous cause and the hallowed way
    of the Empress.\"\n\n\"Many of you have heard of the disaster the Minmatar had
    in Aset, but I have been vigilant and have discovered some disturbing information
    and all is not as it seems.\"\n\n\"The disaster in Aset was caused by an Ancient
    artefact that the miners uncovered.  My most worthy military scholars have anaylsed
    the information at hand and believe that this artefact has significant strategic
    value.  We cannot allow it to fall into the Minmatars hands.\"\n\n \n\n\"Therefore
    I am issuing a crusade edict to take the system of Aset and hold it while my forces
    retrieve the device for the good of the Empire.  Aset is deep within enemy held
    space and the task will not be easy, but I have faith, for we are the chosen of
    God and nothing is beyond our reach.\n\nFor the God and the Empress!  \""
