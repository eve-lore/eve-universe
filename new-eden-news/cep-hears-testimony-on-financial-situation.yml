    - Representatives from the House of Records and Caldari Funds Unlimited testified
    before a Chief Executive Panel investigatory committee today, painting a bleak
    picture of future Caldari development in the occupied territories. House of Records
    analyst Noki Ban led with the most sobering assessment, saying that, \"The situation
    emerging is that many investors were not prepared for the speed and ferocity of
    the Federation counterattack.\"\n\nAccording to Ban's economic models, many corporations
    may have over-leveraged themselves and did not take adequate precautions before
    beginning operations in the occupied territories. \"If the current trends continue,\"
    said Ban, 'we can expect bankruptcies and loan defaults all throughout the economic
    spectrum. Another credit crisis, similar to what we experienced last year, is
    not impossible.\"\n\nCaldari Funds Unlimited provided much of the financing for
    new corporate ventures in the occupied territories. Its CEO, Jaan Omura, seemed
    less pessimistic than Ban. \"So far, while we have seen a number of defaults by
    smaller, independent corporations, we have yet to see serious issues with any
    loans made to megacorporate subsidiaries,\" she told the committee. \"While we
    have re-evaluated our lending policies in the wake of this counteroffensive, we
    believe any economic setbacks will be temporary and most investment will be recovered.\"\n\nResponse
    to the testimony was mixed, though all committee members expressed surprise at
    the House of Records' dire assessment. Sukuuvestaa and Wiyrkomi called for further
    investigation, proposing a combined Caldari Business Tribunal and House of Records
    audit of the disputed territories."
