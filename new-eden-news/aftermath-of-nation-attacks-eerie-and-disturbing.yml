    750.000 Federation citizens were abducted from the Ation system by Sansha's Nation
    in a recent raid. Much like in previous raids the Nation left the attacked sites
    nearly devoid of human life, carrying off everyone from the newly born to the
    elderly.  \n  \nEstigone, a settlement of nearly 200.000, was one of the main
    sites of the Sansha attack. Before the attack it was a bustling industrial community
    in growth, centered around several factories belonging to Aliastra. Now it lies
    deserted, with nearly every one of its citizens taken during the Nation raid.
    \ \n  \nAcross the settlement, evidence of its previous inhabitants is easy to
    come by. Half-eaten dinners sit rotting on tables. Holoplayers loop their reels
    unceasingly. Computer screens display incomplete messages. Unfiled reports sit
    on office desks. Family pets claw at cages and gnaw at restraints.  \n  \nPerhaps
    most baffling is the lack of evidence for any resistance. Though Estigone had
    an organized and armed police force, there is little indication that they mustered
    any opposition to the Nation's raiders. Weapons remain unfired in their lockers,
    the safeties still on. While there are some small signs of conflict, such as blaster
    holes and scattered debris from small explosions, much of the city is undamaged.
    \ \n  \n\"It's almost as if everyone just got up and peacefully walked into the
    Sansha dropships,\" said Therion Niemann, a representative of the Sisters of EVE
    who was dispatched to search for survivors. \"I've seen some disturbing battle
    sites before, but nothing has been quite so eerie as this.\""
