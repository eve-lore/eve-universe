    Capsuleer-assembled Fortizar Citadels have arrived in New Eden, and with them,
    a whole new round of conflict and controversy.\n\nThe title of first onlined Fortizar
    Citadel goes to [Hard Knocks Inc.](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/Hard_Knocks_Inc.)
    for onlining the Hard Knocks Rental Office on May 5th located in the wormhole
    with the signature [J115405](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/J115405), codenamed
    \"RAGE\".\n\nThe _Fortizar_ is Upwell 's large Citadel. Unlike its medium sized
    counterpart, [the Astrahus](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/interstellar-correspondents/first-capsuleer-citadels-cause-turmoil-across-new-eden/),
    the Fortizar model is capable of housing full Capital-sized vessels and is designed
    to be a primary base of operations for a medium to large alliance.\n\n[![](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/70284/1/Fortizar_in_RAGE550.jpg)](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/70284/1/Fortizar_in_RAGE.jpg)

    Citadels have caused fewer conflicts overall than the smaller Astrahus Citadels,
    Pandemic Horde's newly-onlined \"Pillow Fortizar\" was hotly contested but successfully
    onlined against Imperium forces and Interceptor fleets.\n\n[The first ever Fortizar-class
    Citadel getting destroyed](https://zkillboard.com/kill/53914509/#comments) fell
    victim to Hard Knocks Inc. in the wormhole system of [J104859](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/J104859),
    on 11 May.\n\nMeanwhile, [Capsuleer controversy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4iuspx/upwell_consortium_shady_as_hell/)
    has begun circling the Upwell Consortium as concerns about their nonchalant and
    arguably opportunist attitude in regards to the Citadels - in spite of the thousands
    of colonists killed in the conflicts - has begun to disturb even some of the immortal
    Capsuleers.\n\n \n\n**Links:**\n\nEVE-Guides ' [Guide to Citadels](http://eve-guides.fr/index.php?article=132)
