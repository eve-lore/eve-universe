    - In an announcement that further signals Royal Heir Yonis Ardishapur's determination
    that the Ammatar Mandate be a major contributor to the strategic goals of the
    Amarr Empire, the Ammatar Fleet has declared five major shipyards in and around
    the Sasta system as once more fully operational, ready to supply and refit the
    ships of the combined Ammatar and Ardishapur fleet forces.\n\nIn remarks transmitted
    from Fleet HQ in Sasta, Grand Admiral Hastar Jibril of the Ammatar Fleet expressed
    his \"deep satisfaction that the reconstruction of these essential shipyards has
    been carried out on time thanks to the unstinting work of the Ammatar people.\"
    Since his appointment, Grand Admiral Jibril has been overseeing the integration
    of the Ammatar Fleet and those units of the Ardishapur forces assigned to his
    command. The reconstruction of these shipyards, all heavily damaged by Minmatar-Thukker
    strike forces during the Elder Invasion, was a major priority for the Grand Admiral
    as they will allow the necessary refitting and retasking of the Fleet's disparate
    units to proceed quickly.\n\nIn a related development, the Ammatar Fleet has announced
    that it intends to refit a line of 'Yonis variant' Abaddons for use on extended
    patrols of the Minmatar border. Usually reserved for important garrisons or major
    taskforces, the Abaddon-class has not been favoured by Amarr commanders as a patrol
    vessel due to its high energy requirements and large crew complement. It is speculated
    by naval architecture experts that the 'Yonis variant' will feature additional
    power plants and possibly reduced crew and firepower requirements to make it practical
    for prestige patrol duties."
