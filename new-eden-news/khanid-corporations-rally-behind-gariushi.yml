- body: "Parses \u2013 Representatives of several Khanid corporations have today shown
    a united front in applauding Ishukone Corporation CEO Otro Gariushi's recent address.
    The consensus at Khanid Trans-stellar Opportunities \u2013 a tradeshow that remains
    a regular calendar feature for many corporations in the Kingdom \u2013 seems to
    be that disruptions in the State, while not presenting a major threat to Khanid
    industry, are bad for business. \n\nSpeaking outside the main hall, Royal Amalgamated
    marketing manager Safia Rostrimy stated that \"we do extensive business with the
    State and were saddened to see some of our Caldari cousins behaving little better
    than unenlightened Minmatar\". Amalgamated, a subsidiary of Khanid Transport,
    has shown solid performance over the past couple of years, deriving much of its
    business from deals with other Empires, and its stock price, like those of most
    Khanid corporations, has remained steady in spite of recent events. \n\nLobbyist
    Madarun Tomaler, speaking on behalf of industry group \"Opportunity In Action\",
    echoed Rostrimy's position, explaining \"Ishukone has always served as a role
    model for our corporations \u2013 Gariushi's benevolence and foresight has inspired
    many managers to ensure that their employees are properly valued and supported
    in the workplace, by monitoring working conditions carefully and more efficiently
    leveraging biological assets to lower workloads for employees\". OiA has been
    using the event as an opportunity to promote its \"Business Partners\" programme,
    encouraging Khanid corporations to work with their Caldari counterparts as part
    of a concerted effort to help stabilize the State's volatile economy. \n\nThe
    office of the King has released a statement expressing regret at the recent losses
    of Caldari life and property, but decrying those who seek to meddle in the political
    affairs of sovereign entities. Further requests for comment have been denied."
