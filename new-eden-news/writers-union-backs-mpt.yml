    Matari Writers Association, a union representing writers of theatre and holovid
    pieces, today backed the MPT's decision to produce the highly controversial play
    \ 'Plantation.' \"While we do not normally condone the adaptation of works outside
    of their intended millieu, we also do not condone repression of freedom of any
    kind. We find the actions of those upset with the MPT's decision to stage this
    play to be reprehensible,\" said Koto Rydd, the group's spokesman. \n\nThe play,
    written 600 years ago by Ammatar author Dekkameron, explores the issues of power
    among the powerless. Set on an Ammarian plantation, the play focuses not on the
    cruelty of slavery but the cruelty amongst slaves. The Ammarian slave holders,
    rather than being the antagonists, are portrayed as benign individuals whose good
    intentions are abused by those slaves who seek power over their own kind. Rydd
    explained \"The play is not about slavery, it is about power. The juxtaposition
    between slave and slaveholder, which shows the latter to be basically powerless
    against a small group of slaves that effectively run the plantation, is a brilliant
    literary device that Dekkameron uses to great effect.\""
