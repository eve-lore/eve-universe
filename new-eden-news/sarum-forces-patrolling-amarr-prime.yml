- body: "AMARR: A strange sight meets those who fly through Amarr prime these days
    - police vessels. Actually, what makes them strange is that they all bear the
    markings of \"Sarum surveilance\". \n\nNearly all police and military vessels
    met there belong to the Sarum navy. Even more alarming, this fact hasn't been
    publicly advertised in any way, so many Amarr citizens just assume that the ships
    belong to the Amarr navy, or perhaps the security forces of the old emperor. And
    why would they think otherwise? Not everybody takes a close look at police vessels,
    which are such a common sight this deep in empire space. \n\nYet in light of recent
    events, their presence there causes extreme worry in some circles. Why isn't the
    Amarr administration making sure that neutral forces patrol Amarr prime - at least
    until the new emperor is crowned?"
