- body: "Yulai, Genesis - CONCORD's military leadership submitted proposals for the
    establishment of a \"New Eden Defense Fund\" at this morning's meeting of the
    Inner Circle's War Council. The DED's Star Marshal Kjersidur Elladall and AEGIS
    Provost Marshal Kasiha Valkanir jointly advocated the measure in response to mounting
    losses of personnel, materiel, and installations vital to the fight against the
    Triglavian invasion and other emergent threats to New Eden.\n\nAccording to the
    plan outlined by Marshals Elladall and Valkanir, the New Eden Defense Fund would:
    pay for essential works to improve planetary and station defenses; provide resources
    for CONCORD defense fleet repairs, replacements and expansion; and fund research
    into anti-Triglavian and anti-Drifter countermeasures. Key elements of the plan
    also focus on recruitment drives to make up losses in personnel, a program of
    enhanced training and augmentation of troops, and funding for personal survival
    equipment - including highly expensive backup personality recording systems.\n\nInner
    Circle delegates received the DED proposals \"in grim but attentive silence\"
    according to one aide that spoke to the Scope. Just prior to the defense fund
    presentation, the meeting had reviewed a digest of losses incurred by CONCORD
    and core empire forces while fighting Triglavian invasion forces, as well as repelling
    Drifter, Sansha's Nation and Blood Raider attacks, over the last month.\n\nCONCORD
    military and security budgets are additionally under great strain due to the costs
    of supporting capsuleer efforts to repel the Triglavian invasion with loyalty
    programs and training uptake support using SoCT technology. Star Marshal Elladall
    is said to have been persuaded of the importance of backing capsuleer defense
    operations by Provost Marshal Valkanir.\n\nThe Inner Circle subsequently voted
    unanimously to recommend the proposal to the full CONCORD Assembly, with a request
    that legislation be implemented to fully fund the measures. The CONCORD Assembly
    is set to begin a special session tonight, and remain in session over the weekend,
    to debate the options for funding the huge expansion in military spending advocated
    by the Inner Circle, DED and AEGIS.\n\n**In Other News**\n\n  * Lai Dai Protection
