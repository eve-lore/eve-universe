- body: "Yulai - At a CONCORD press conference held earlier today, the official nomenclature
    of the recently opened regions - commonly called \"the drone regions\" by the
    general capsuleer populace - was announced. Speculation had been rife regarding
    the delays in announcing the names following the landmark decision by CONCORD
    to solicit the capsuleer community in the naming process. \n\nCommander Nakuyama,
    the official in charge of the naming committee, used the conference as an opportunity
    to apologize for the delay. \"As you know, CONCORD has stringent regulations regarding
    the demarcation and labeling of geographical space. All proposed names must be
    checked against our sanctioned database for suitability and uniqueness. In this
    case, the procedures took considerably longer than originally anticipated, as
    a few last minute changes were necessary to meet the requirements.\" \n\nThe commander
    went on to admit that CONCORD has been both surprised and impressed by the professional
    conduct of the capsuleers now resident in the region. \"We look forward to instituting
    new programs with capsuleers,\" he commented in relation to CONCORD's often-criticized
    relationship with capsuleers, whose influence has been growing greatly as its
    population expands. \n\nThe press conference ended with the announcement of the
    new region names, which are as follows: \n\nH3J8-U - Cobalt Edge  \n6HL8-L - Outer
    Passage  \nVU-WU2 - The Spire  \n7-KXBJ - Etherium Reach  \n87-1CW - Kalevala
    Expanse  \nLQ-OQN - Malpais  \nS-I6VU - Perrigen Falls  \nG5KW-3 - Oasa"
