    \ \n_Above: Federation Senate Station in Villore Engulfed by Volatile Ice Storm_\n\n**Volatile
    Ice Storms Sweep Across New Eden as Yoiul Festival Season Begins**\n\nYulai, Genesis
    -- CONCORD has issued general advisory notices warning of the hazards of a large
    number of vast \"volatile ice storms\" that are sweeping across New Eden. The
    SCC is recommending civilian cargo and transport traffic take alternative routes
    where possible. The Directive Enforcement Department has also noted the presence
    of Sansha's Nation forces seeking to exploit the resources that can be discovered
    in volatile ice deposits occuring in this form of metaliminal storm.\n\nFor its
    part, ORE's Frostline Laboratories division has taken the opportunity to further
    test its latest filament transport technology prototypes by making them available
    to capsuleers. In recent years, Frostline's research and development has focused
    on filament technology with a view to its potential uses in resource exploitation.
    A recently-filed financial report indicated Frostline is researching filament
    guidance using the space-time anomalies that metaliminal storms are believed to
    form around.\n\nSince their emergence in August YC122, most research into metaliminal
    storms has indicated they are associated with changes to the local cluster's space-time
    topology caused by Triglavian stellar manipulation. Certain storms appear to represent
    a \"leakage\" of Abyssal Deadspace environmental radiation and particles into
    normal space. However, Frostline's theorists are suggesting the ice storms may
    represent a localized reduction in thermal energy, potentially caused by energy
    \"draining\" into Abyssal Deadspace through quadrillions of microscopic wormholes.\n\nThe
    DED is supporting the elimination of the Sansha's Nation \"Wightstorm Fleet\"
    by capsuleers, with its own patrol forces overstretched by the increase in space
    traffic as Yoiul Festival season begins. EDENCOM's planetary fortification programs
    continue to enhance the security of population centers and AEGIS forces are on
    alert for possible Sansha's Nation planetary raids.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/industrial_sectors_4_4_jita.png)
    \ \n_Above: Jita 4-4 Trading Hub Contributes Significantly to High Traffic During
    Yoiul Festival Season_\n\n**InterBus Launches Yoiul Festival Spaceship Safety
    Campaign as Passenge Traffic Increases**\n\nJita, The Forge -- InterBus has launched
    a spaceship safety campaign with passenger transport traffic set to experience
    its usual increase during the Yoiul Festival season. As the largest civilian passenger
    transportation operation in New Eden, InterBus has a special concern to increase
    passenger and crew awareness of typical hazards aboard spaceships large and small.\n\nThe
    InterBus safety campaign has taken a light-hearted approach to the topic of safety,
    with the spaceship safety displays it has distributed using spacer legends of
    clone blanks coming to life and wreaking havoc aboard ship. The \"Yoiul Clones\"
    campaign is intended to be eye-catching and highlights the serious subject of
    ship safety in this unusual manner so as to overcome \"warning fatigue\" experienced
    by many in the relatively hazardous space-industrial sectors.\n\nIn related news,
    CONCORD's Project Discovery has reported preliminary successes in its efforts
    to identify and develop treatments for novel coronaviruses that first broke out
    in space stations and asteroid colonies during the Triglavian Invasions. Believed
    to be a consequence of increased movement of military personnel and fortification
    workers during the invasions, the spread of various novel diseases has been tracked
    by Project Discovery for many months. CONCORD officials have expressed cautious
    satisfaction with the results from Project Discovery so far.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/dcm_4_4_moon_elevator.png)
    \ \n_Above: DCM Jita 4-4 Moon Mining Colony and Moon-Space Elevator_\n\n**Unrest
    at Jita 4-4 Moon Mining Colony as Protests Over Extended Working and Transit Costs
    Flare Up**\n\nJita, The Forge -- Unrest has broken out at the Jita 4-4 Moon Mining
    Colony as extended working hours and high transit costs for workers have led to
    protests and isolated riots. Although tempers were already frayed at the Deep
    Core Mining operated colony, due to invasion-related protests and high-intensity
    working around the completion of the Caldari Navy Jita 4-4 station's core trading
    hub, many felt the coming festival season would provide some respite. Consequently,
    the announced extended hours and travel costs caused an explosion of unrest among
    workers in the moon colony.\n\nThe CBD megacorporation's Spacelane Patrol has
    been deployed in force to support its DCM subsidiary's overstretched colony security
    forces. Caldari Navy forces have deployed to both ends of the DCM moon-space elevator
    to ensure the security of this vital link between the moon mining colony and the
    Jita 4-4 station complex.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/rkn_forces_neda_iii.png)
    \ \n_Above: Royal Khanid Navy Forces Deploy Over Neda III_\n\n**Khanid Kingdom
    Deploys Troops to Neda System to \"Quell Uprisings and Piratical Opportunists\"**\n\nNeda,
    Khanid -- Following Blood Raider attacks and reported slave rebellions, Royal
    Khanid Navy vessels have taken part in operations in Neda system, deploying RKN
    marines and units of the 8th and 19th Royal Uhlans to Neda III and Neda V. The
    RKN's Neda relief force is under the direct command of Sardar Admiral Mirza Ul-Chakaid,
    Military Governor of the Homroon constellation. Khanid Kingdom authorities have
    declared that \"slave rebellion is not excused by the chaos caused by blood cultist
    raids and piratical opportunism by capsuleers affiliated with other Royal Houses.\"\n\nHouse
    Khanid is currently locked in a political struggle with House Ardishapur over
    the fate of the Khanid warlord and religious figure Duke Alar Chakaid. The Theology
    Council continues to hear evidence in a case on the Duke Chakaid matter, with
    the latest development being a motion for Theology Council paladins to take custody
    of Alar Chakaid from the Order of St. Tetrimon, and move him from Tanoo to a \"neutral
    location in the heart of the Empire of Holy Amarr.\"\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/triglavians_skarkon_ii.png)
    \ \n_Above: Svarog Clade Forces Carry Out Combat Operations in Skarkon II Orbit_\n\n**Minmatar
    Tribal Council Reasserts Tribal Sovereignty Over Skarkon; Repudiates \"Pro-Triglavian\"
    Capsuleer and Warclone Claims**\n\nMatar, Pator System -- The Minmatar Tribal
    Council has reasserted the \"enduring and total sovereignty of the Seven Tribes
    of Matar\" over the system of Skarkon, conquered by the Triglavians and made a
    Svarog Clade-controlled system within the newly-created Pochven region. The declaration,
    also covering the system of Krirald, comes as various Republic loyalist and \"Pro-Triglavian\"
    warclone and capsuleer groups make claims and counter-claims over the status of
    Skarkon and territories within it.\n\nFollowing a meeting of the Tribal Council,
    Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor said, \"It is plain enough to anyone who is actually loyal
    to the Matari people that the lands of Skarkon II are tribal lands in perpetuity.
    No claims based on spurious Amarr-style arguments merit a moment's consideration.
    Outsiders and fallen kin may try to cook up a pretty meal of persuasion, by finely
    chopping words and logic, but all Matari know that there is no true moot feast
    for any tribe and clan to be found in such dressed up pap.\"\n\nThe Minmatar Republic
    considers all territories of Skarkon system to now fall under the direct jurisdiction
    of the Skarkon Tribal Resistance Army, commanded by Valklear General Kril Efrit,
    as \"the sole lawful authority representing the Council of the Seven Tribes of
    Matar.\" The Thukker Tribe has also confirmed that various territorial leases
    of its tribal lands on Skarkon II were \"automatically terminated when acts of
    terror and war were made against the lawful government of Skarkon II.\"\n\nThe
    Skarkon Tribal Resistance Army continues to defy the Triglavian invaders on Skarkon
    II, with a number of missile strikes carried out against Svarog Clade and pro-Triglavian
    warclone positions in recent weeks. Additionally, STRA numbers have been bolstered
    by reinforcements of volunteers from the Republic armed forces and Minmatar paramilitary
    groups. Depite the resistance efforts, reports from EDENCOM briefings indicate
    Svarog forces continue to hold the population centers of Skarkon II and are slowly
    expanding their zones of control across the planet.\n\n**In Other News**\n\n  *
