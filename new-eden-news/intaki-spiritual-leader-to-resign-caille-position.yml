- body: "SINQ LAISON. Intaki spiritual leader Vremaja Idama has resigned from his
    lecturing position at the [University of Caille](http://www.eve-online.com/corporations/c_1000115.asp)
    in the schools of History, Philosophy and Politics. \n\nThe resignation, coming
    just a few weeks after his hiring [last March](http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=1110&tid=5),
    was reportedly closely related to Mr. Vremaja's displeasure with the Federation
    government's lack of support for Intaki culture and citizens. In his own words,
    \"as an Idama [Intaki for \"Most Holy\"], I made a vow to be an example to my
    people. I can no longer in good conscience allow myself to be associated with
    an administration which knowingly neglects a significant portion of its citizens.
    The [Federation's] Government is there to serve its people, not the other way
    around.\" Mr. Vremaja made no comment about his future, although a return to Intaki
    Prime is rumoured by the majority of the University's Intaki students. \n\nCarbircelle
    Hatiniestan, Caille's CEO, confessed to being dumbstruck by the news. \"Although
    I tend to agree with [Mr. Vremaja's] perception that the Federation's government
    could, and indeed should, take more proactive measures towards protecting minority
    cultures, to my knowledge nothing has changed during the last month regarding
    the Fed's position towards Intaki culture, population or Homeworld. I would be
    at a loss to mention what, exactly, made Mr. Vremaja resign from a post he accepted
    not two months ago. It is a great loss to our University, and I wholeheartedly
    hope he will return to our faculty at a future date.\" \n\nIntaki students applauded
    what most of them consider a portent of the Idama's return to Intaki Prime and
    expect Mr. Vremaja to lead a pro-Intaki demonstration in the near future, citing
    a perceived increase in Gallente xenophobia as evidenced by presidential candidate
    Sen. Mentas Blaque's latest speeches as the major cause of Mr. Vremaja's resignation.
    Quite a few Deteis students agree with the above, considering Mr. Vremaja's recent
    marriage to Ms. Vika Kuvakei, a Deteis closely linked to Lai Dai, to be a potential
    source of Gallente pressure against him. Ms. Hatiniestan labelled these rumours
    as \"nonsense.\"\n\n\"Few places in the cluster can rival our University's multiracial
    environment, where both our professors and students come from literally every
    corner of the galaxy,\" she said. \n\nNo official comment has been made by any
    Federation government officials."
