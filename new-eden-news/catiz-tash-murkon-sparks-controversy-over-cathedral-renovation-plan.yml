- body: "Harsh words have been exchanged between the Kador family and the Tash-Murkon
    family regarding the latter\u2019s plans to turn a religious site into a tourist
    attraction. Catiz Tash-Murkon recently bought the now infamous cathedral on Eclipticum,
    the site of the sordid incident involving Articio Kor-Azor. The cathedral has
    been closed since the incident and in need of repairs and renovations. None has
    been willing to take up this burden until Catiz stepped in.   \n  \nCatiz plans
    to fund the extensive repairs needed by allowing tourists, for the first time,
    to visit the holy site - dedicated to the saint Tal-Romon, the first Udorian to
    reach sainthood.   \n  \nThis has sparked a hot debate amongst the Amarrians,
    and been especially fiercely criticized by the Kador and Ardishapur families,
    which are outraged that commoners will be allowed to walk the hallow grounds around
    the esteemed cathedral. But Catiz is adamant she will continue with the plan \u2018in
    honor of St. Tal-Romon, which was a guiding light in his time and should continue
    to be so in our time.\u2019"
