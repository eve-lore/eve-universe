- body: "The Minmatar Republic is currently alive with debate over whether the Sebiestor
    tribe's motion to place a ban on the Khumaak, a ceremonial weapon worn by statesmen
    and senior officers of the armed forces, should be passed into law. Tribal Council
    meetings in the days since the proposal have been filled with vitriol, both sides
    making increasingly strongly-worded statements on what has now been termed both
    a \"glowing testament to the Minmatar race's indomitable spirit\" and a \"harmful
    symbol of hate and barbarism.\" A few of the Council debates are reported to have
    escalated into shouted oratory and personal attacks.   \n  \nThe Minmatar people,
    meanwhile, are showing their support in other ways. The day after the motion was
    announced, sales of Khumaak replicas shot through the roof on worlds throughout
    the Republic. Many people have taken to wearing the replicas in public, and organized
    protests by opponents of the ban have necessitated police intervention in at least
    five different cities so far.   \n  \nUnder the Tribal Traditions Preservation
    Act of 23285, Minmatar starship captains and other RFSC-approved vessel pilots
    are legally allowed to purchase genuine Khumaaks from the Republic Justice Department's
    Ministry of Ceremony. Through the widespread public debate of the past days this
    fact has now become common knowledge, prompting intense market demand for the
    item. Public debate forums are rife with supporters, many of whom are vocal about
    their ownership -- and proud display -- of a genuine Khumaak.   \n  \nHoloreel
    director Jarol Brint's twelve-year old reel _The Fire of a Nation_ , a fictional
    account of the events on Ezzara VI during the rebellion, has enjoyed a tremendous
    resurgence in popularity. In response to public demand, entertainment networks
    and theaters alike have taken up repeated showings of the reel.   \n  \n\"Yeah,
    they've really taken to it,\" said an unidentified theater manager. \"My revenues
    are up 200% from the day before yesterday. I don't know, it's almost like people
    have been waiting for something like this to happen.\""
