- body: "A startling new development surrounding the 500 Sebiestor slaves awarded
    to the CVA halted the auction of those slaves as the Cross of the Sacred Throne
    Order, awarded to Golan Trevize by the Emperor himself, was stolen.   \n  \nThe
    Admiral's Estates are notoriously well guarded. Rivaling the level of security
    surrounding the Amarr Navy's most prominent generals, Admiral Trevize's estates
    is guarded by ravenous packs of slavers, trained to hunt and brutalize any individual
    they do not recognize. Well-trained and equipped guards regularly patrol the outer
    perimeter, scent-keyed to the Slavers to allow them to pass unmolested by the
    murderous beasts. The outer walls are guarded by automated laser turrets that
    fire upon any unauthorized individual. Although the outer defenses are well documented,
    surprisingly little information is available about the inner core. Even though
    what really lies within the grand halls of the Trevize Estates, breaking in was
    said to be impossible until now.   \n  \nI was able to interview one of the guards
    assigned to Admiral Trevize's estates, asking him about the circumstances of the
    theft.   \n  \n\"We don't know who took it. It's impossible for anyone to pass
    the Slavers unmolested, impossible to breach the inner sanctums, let alone the
    5 meter thick Morphite infused vaults.   \n  \nWhoever it was, he must have either
    been planning this for months, or be absurdly good at what he does.\"   \n  \nThe
    guard in question is currently scheduled for execution later this day.   \n  \nI
    can't help but wonder what this means to the CVA and their efforts. The Cross
    represents the admiration and support lent to the CVA forces by the Amarr Empire.
    Its theft is an embarrassment to the CVA and as such, I expect them to stop at
    nothing to retrieve it."
