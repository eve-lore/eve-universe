    - Officials of the Amarr Trade Registry monitoring the Ammatar Mandate have declared
    that food production within the Derelik region has returned to pre-invasion levels
    with a consequent reduction in food imports from other regions of the Amarr Empire.
    Since the Elder Invasion, the Mandate has been highly dependent on food imports
    and has barely managed to stave off famine in some areas.\n\nThe Elder Invasion
    of YC110 caused widespread damage to many agricultural plantations within the
    Ammatar Mandate, despite the invasion forces limiting their strikes to military
    infrastructure and strategic installations which posed a threat to their primary
    goal of recovering slaves. As slaves were seized by the Minmatar-Thukker forces,
    the holdings on which they worked were often heavily damaged during the initial
    assaults. Further incidental damage, up to and including the burning of some plantations,
    is associated with rioting and sporadic clashes with Amarr troops during the invasion
    and in its immediate aftermath.\n\nAdreyi Ezion, the Chief Financial Officer of
    the Ardishapur Family and the architect of much of the Mandate's reconstruction,
    welcomed the assessement of the Amarr Trade Registry and stated that the ultimate
    goal of the Ardishapur administration was to make the Ammatar Mandate self-sufficient
    in food staples and, eventually, an export partner with the rest of the Amarr
    Empire."
