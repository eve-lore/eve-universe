    [all districts](https://fiction.eveonline.com/new-eden/lore/gallente-federal-districts)
    at 00:00 8th May New Eden time. Outgoing President Jacus Roden has ordered the
    highest level of civilian and military security at vital infrastructure across
    New Eden, vowing that there will be \"no repeat of the [February Election Attacks](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/federation-under-election-eve-comms-network-attack-as-terrorists-target-presidential-candidates/).\"\n\nWhile
    all eyes are on the race for the Presidency of the Federated Union of Gallente
    Prime, a fifth of the 903 Federal Senate seats are up for election in this year's
    cycle, with 181 sub-districts also voting for their Senate representatives. Early
    indications are that voting participation numbers are very high, with Federal
    elections and communications authorities reporting high usage of secure voting
    channels in all sub-districts.\n\n**Polling Indications**\n\nFollowing latest
    pre-election polling, The Scope's Election HQ team has assessed the race for the
    Presidency as a contest between two strong runners: Mies Governor Celes Aguard
    and former Arcurio Mayor Shaileen Ramnev. Senator Suvio Bellaron of Intaki may
    still have a path to victory but his chances are hurt by weakness outside the
    Placid and Essence regions. Ramnev's reconciliation message has resonated with
    many voters but the popularity of Aguard's \"unity, security, diversity\" message
    has proved enduring. Aguard's pledge to link Solitude directly to the main Federation
    gate network has particularly energized voters in that region.\n\nMentas Blaque,
    former Senate Head and Chief of the Federal Intelligence Office, has performed
    relatively poorly in polling despite his aggressive attempts to project himself
    as the face of Gallente \"prosperity with security.\" Our analysis team suggest
    much of his appeal has been undercut by the strong security record of Governor
    Aguard and the insurgent campaign of Federal Defense Union General Julianus Soter.
    While the latter is trailing among the most prominent candidates, voters inclined
    to back hawkish views have been split across three campaigns with Blaque's spotted
    record as FIO head hurting him.\n\nSenator Kelen Ontbad of Colelie has seen his
    presidential hopes collapse as polls over the last month have indicated clearly
    his appeal amongst dovish and reconciliation-minded voters has drained away in
    favor of Shaileen Ramnev's campaign. Ramnev's campaign has been boosted significantly
    by a number of endorsements from senators of the Labor-Populist Alliance and other
    key figures in the \"Doves\" bloc. Analysts speculate that aggressive anti-reconciliation
    campaigning against Ramnev served mainly to highlight her as the leading champion
    of such positions.\n\n**Political and Ethnic Attitudes**\n\nThe role of political
    parties and ethnic groups has been felt keenly in the Senate races but has also
    had significant influence over the Presidential campaign. Suvio Bellaron has strong
    support among backers of the Federalist-Liberal Party, but equally is opposed
    by many among the Jin-Mei and Mannar communities for his central-interventionist
    views. Observers have also noted that Mannar voters have swung decisively behind
    Governor Celes Aguard since fellow candidate and Mannar Councillor Wayaki Kayara
    ended his campaign in favor of the governor's. Kelen Ontbad's hopes were perhaps
    most heavily hit by the defection of many among the Matari diaspora to the cause
    of Shaileen Ramnev.\n\nThe issue of Senator Bellaron's capital punishment abolition
    bill, passed by the Senate and awaiting approval or veto by the next president,
    has also been polarizing across political party and ethnic lines. Both the New
    Sociocrats, largely backing Mentas Blaque, and the Progressive Union, strong supporters
    of Celes Aguard, have outright condemned the bill and called for it to be vetoed
    by the next president. The Jin-Mei bloc continues to rail against the measure,
    while the Intaki diaspora strongly supports it.\n\nGallente supporters of the
    Labor-Populists and Federalist-Liberals have tended to back a ban on capital punishment.
    Analysts believe the Soter campaign's backing for a capital punishment ban, despite
    his overall hawkish positions, has reduced further his somewhat limited appeal
    outside Gallente and Intaki communities.\n\n**Weekend Polling Ends Sunday**\n\nFor
    his part, two-term President Jacus Roden has stayed above the political fray,
    notably declining to endorse former political ally Mentas Blaque, and has indicated
    he intends to be a \"neutral guarantor of the peaceful transfer of government
    according to the democratic will of the peoples of the Federated Union\". The
    election weekend polling will end at midnight New Eden time on Sunday, with final
    results expected to be declared late on Monday. The inauguration of the next President
    of the Federated Union of Gallente Prime is scheduled for Friday 15th May.\n\n**The
