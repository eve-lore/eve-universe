- body: "The Kaalakiota Corporation\u2019s office of public relations released a statement
    this morning wherein they proclaim the situation at Truiisu Station on Kassigainen
    IV to be \u201Cfully under control.\u201D The statement comes in the wake of steadily-crescendoing
    voices of condemnation from various international parties over the past week.
    \  \n  \n\u201CThe insurgent force has been neutralized as peacefully as was possible
    under the circumstances,\u201D the statement reads. \u201CA majority of the people
    on the colony have been transported to safer havens, and the station\u2019s facilities
    have survived mostly intact. We estimate that repair operations and work force
    replacement will take a period of three to four weeks, after which Truiisu Station
    will be up and running at full efficiency.\u201D   \n  \nThe statement has been
    met with widespread scepticism. Senator Mentas Blaque of the Gallente Federation,
    in a short interview with the Scope this morning, called it \u201Ca blanket of
    lies, incompetently woven by rank amateurs to cover up the fact they don\u2019t
    care one whit for the well-being of their people.\u201D He furthermore claimed
    he had data from reliable sources which showed the \u201Cso-called peaceful neutralization
    of the insurgents was anything but.\u201D Pressed for details, the senator refused
    to comment further.   \n  \nOthers have moved to cast aspersions on Kaalakiota\u2019s
    statement, variously questioning the considerably drawn-out time frame of the
    operation, the hush-hush nature of the corporation\u2019s methodology and the
    sparse wording of the release itself.   \n  \n\u201CIt [the statement] doesn\u2019t
    really answer the questions most people have, such as why there have been Home
    Guard and Caldari Navy dropships stationed in orbit around Kassigainen IV for
    the past week, with not an aid vessel in sight,\u201D said Touvelas Sarkin, senior
    professor of political science at the University of Caille.   \n  \nSarkin said
    the efforts made by Kaalakiota to salvage the situation showcased more of a desire
    to sweep the symptoms under the carpet rather than make any moves towards fixing
    the underlying problem.   \n  \n\u201CThey just want to stamp it out and pretend
    it didn\u2019t happen instead of actually looking at what they can do to make
    sure it doesn\u2019t repeat itself. With the way things are now \u2013 salary
    and benefit cuts, mass layoffs, diminished worker rights - I\u2019d say we\u2019re
    sure to see that happen soon, possibly even on a larger scale,\u201D he said."
