- body: '_Luminaire - _Gerne Broteau, the convicted mass-shooter responsible for the
    death of [Karin Midular](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Karin Midular), was
    remanded into [Minmatar Republic](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Minmatar)
    custody today. A fleet of [Republic Security Services](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Republic
    Security Services) ships arrived at the [Federal Intelligence Office](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Federal
    Intelligence Office) station in Oursulaert, where Broteau had been held awaiting
    transfer, shortly after noon, and accepted the handover.


    Broteau was then escorted back into Minmatar space, where he is expected to face
    a full trial before the [Sebiestor tribe](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sebiestor
    Tribe) for the massacre, which included the deaths of many non-Sebiestor and several
    Gallente Federation citizens. Broteau has already been sentenced to 14 consecutive
    life sentences in the [Federation](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente)
    for the attack. The trial is expected to begin immediately.


    The decision to transfer him to Republic custody has been harshly criticized by
    several elements of the Federation, including several senators belonging to the
    Sociocrats party, who have called the move "a violation of Federal law in order
    to appease a belligerent foreign power." One senator said, "Broteau deserves to
    be punished for his heinous crimes. But it should be done in the Federation, where
    the crime occurred and of whom the majority of the victims were citizens. We now
    risk setting a dangerous precedent where the Minmatar can clog our justice system
    with extradition requests for any crime committed against a Minmatar inside the
    Federation, even if they are Federation citizens."


    Even those who have supported the move acknowledge that it is largely conciliatory,
    saying, "Broteau was facing a prison sentence from which he would never exit.
    Once the Republic has meted out their punishment, he will be returned to the Federation
    to serve his sentence."'
