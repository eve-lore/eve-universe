- body: "This morning Muryia Mordu arrived at his headquarters with the bulk of his
    task force. Despite harassment from the Guardian Angels and one major confrontation
    only a handful of ships were lost. Mordu wasted no time upon his arrival, he called
    the leaders of the Legion to an emergency meeting and then proceeded to deploy
    his forces around the Outer Region in case the Guardian Angels send in a retaliation
    force.   \n  \nSpeculations have been ripe over what Mordu\u2019s mission in Serpentis
    space was, as it was obviously neither a raid nor an all out attack. The strange
    devices used by Mordu\u2019s flagship point to ORE, being a company with deep
    pockets and steeped in secrecy it has always been an easy scapegoat for conspiracy
    theorist when it comes to strange occurrences in the Outer Region area. Whether
    this was a reconnaissance or espionage mission of some sort, as the most popular
    conspiracy theories declare, is impossible to tell at the moment. But anything
    that makes Orion Mashel and the usually conservative Muryia Mordu stick their
    necks out in such a fashion is surely nothing trivial in nature."
