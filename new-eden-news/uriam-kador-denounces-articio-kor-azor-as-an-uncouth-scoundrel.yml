- body: "Uriam Kador, head of the respected Kador royal family, has officially denounced
    his fellow heir Articio Kor-Azor and accused him of bringing dishonor to the Amarr
    Empire with his 'idiotic behavior', referring to the infamous 'incident' that
    Articio was involved in a few days ago. Uriam even went so far as to suggest that
    Articio was not fit to be an heir. Although it is common for rival heirs to vie
    for political control behind the scenes it is very unusual for an heir to make
    such a venomous public attack on another heir.  \n  \nArticio made a quick respond
    to Uriam. Far from being apologetic or defensive about his behavior Articio went
    on the attack himself and accused Uriam of being a Federation lackey, hinting
    at the persisting rumors that Uriam has a Gallentean lover of high standing. Articio
    stated that he would rather take advice 'from a pet slave than a weak-minded crony
    of inferior people like Uriam.'  \n  \nArticio's outburst seems to have hit a
    nerve as Uriam quickly withdrew from the debate and has gone to his spring retreat
    in Aridia, where he can't be reached for comments. As for Aritcio, he celebrated
    his ninety-ninth birthday yesterday in customary high style. In the few weeks
    since becoming heir Aritcio has already spent more money on festivities and parties
    than his father did in all his years as an heir."
