- body: "Yesterday saw an astonishing display of firepower as a top-ranking Gurista
    official jumped into Obe with a task force specifically designed to take out a
    star base owned by the Takamatsu Trading Exchange. The official, known only by
    his ID number \u2013 0003 \u2013 was piloting a Phoenix-class dreadnought. Escorted
    by a fleet of Rattlesnake-class battleships and a single Cerberus, the Phoenix
    jumped into the Obe system from the P3EN-E system and immediately began the siege
    of the star base. \n\nWhile details are still unclear, it seems that the star
    base was sabotaged from the inside. Civilian transport vessels were spotted near
    the star base late into the evening, and coded transmissions have been intercepted
    which may have been hackers attempting to gain the access codes of the force field.
    We do know that within 30 minutes the Guristas fleet was destroying the star base
    structures surrounding the control tower. \n\nAs the siege was ongoing, isolated
    skirmishes with pod pilots continued. Just minutes after the force field fell,
    a fleet comprised of NBSI, Forsaken Empire, Phoenix Alliance, and the Mercenary
    Coalition ambushed and attacked the Guristas. Within minutes the two fleets were
    engaged. The Guristas soon found themselves outmatched and retreated to the planets
    of Obe, while the Dreadnought moved to a new location for a counter-attack. \n\nAs
    this reporter watched in horror, the allied fleet began to bicker over the salvageable
    loot from the few Rattlesnakes that had been destroyed. The tension threatened
    to escalate to violence when the Guristas task force re-entered the fray. The
    Phoenix dreadnought and her Rattlesnake escorts opened fire on the remaining ships
    at the star base, and the situation quickly escalated into a full battle. At one
    time over 40 ships were firing on the Phoenix. After ten tense minutes the Phoenix
    began to lose the fight, eventually succumbing to superior numbers. \n\nWhy did
    the Guristas stake so much on such a small operation? A political analyst from
    the University of Caille suggests that the situation is evidence of a superiority
    complex among the Guristas outlaws. \u201CAs they continue to fight with pod pilots
    in their home systems, they rely increasingly on superior technology and have
    the arrogance to match it. These groups cannot lose face and make increasingly
    daring strikes into empire space to prove their strength.\u201D Yesterday\u2019s
    debacle may be evidence of a Gurista commander proving that he could still strike
    fear in fringe systems. \n\nA high ranking official in the Caldari Navy Command
    disagrees with the superiority complex. \u201CI think this was to prove a point,\u201D
    he says, \u201Cto show the Caldari Navy that with their increasing capital ship
    production they could afford to lose a ship like a dreadnought in a relatively
    minor incursion.\u201D \n\nVelio Fumigata, a member of the Takamatsu Trading Exchange,
    has another reason for the attack. \u201CEspionage!\u201D he says, \u201CPlain
    and simple. Our competitors or the Obe natives complained and put out a contract
    on our star base. The Guristas thought they could waltz in and take it down. Fortunately,
    they weren\u2019t allowed to leave the system, but now our star base is ruined!\u201D
    \n\nRumours of the Guristas building several more dreadnoughts and other capital
    ships have yet to be substantiated, but with this latest attack, it seems that
    soon we will see fighting in a scale unheard of before."
