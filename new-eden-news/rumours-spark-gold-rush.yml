- body: "A mysterious explorer has sparked an influx of prospectors into Pegasus as
    they seek their fortune from a reportedly untouched gas cloud. \n\nResidents of
    the area had been bemused by the sudden surge in the local population until rumours
    of the gas formation began to leak out. \n\nWith most other such spacial anomalies
    already harvested, the opportunity to enter or maintain a position in the lucrative
    booster market has been the main thrust behind the prospecting. \n\nOf course
    such a high concentration of mainly non-combatants has seen a smattering of pirate
    activity in the region and as more and more ships head deep into frontier territory,
    so the opportunity for increased conflict grows. \n\nThe recent improvements in
    ship sensor technology has seen many more pod-pilots rush to join the elite pioneers
    that scour the galaxy for its secrets. \n\nEven if the most recent rumours turn
    out to be untrue, such is the potential profit that many corporations in the industry
    cannot afford not to go. Another reason for joining in the 'gold rush' is simply
    safety in numbers. \n\n\"Residents and local pirates will not take kindly to this
    invasion of what they see as their sovereign territory\" said Commander Apira
    of CONCORD. \n\n\"The mad rush by profiteering corporations at least affords them
    some safety as there may simply be too many of them for the locals to deal with,\"
    he added. \n\nThere is at this time no confirmation that any large gas cloud formations
    have been found, and no word of any casualties among the prospectors."
