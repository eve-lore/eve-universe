- body: 'LUMINAIRE 0909 - The FTL communications link between Seyllin I and the Federation
    is located several kilometers beneath the surface of the barren mining world,
    stated engineers familiar with the planet. Four main subterranean cities linked
    by underground magrails hold the bulk of the planet''s population, whose residents
    mostly support mining operations. Access points to the surface are limited due
    to extreme daytime surface temperatures, but robust thermal shielding methods
    allow for spaceport access and limited space elevator operations. Most of the
    power generation for the planet is conducted through geothermal or aneutronic
    fusion means, as some excavation sites have reached depths of more than 100 kilometers
    below the surface.


    The economic value of Seyllin to the Federation is significant, accounting for
    a quarter of all raw ore production in the Thoulde Constellation, and making up
    a significant fraction of the Federation''s supply of key heavy metals. It is
    unknown if the communications outage is associated with the earlier reported loss
    of the planet''s Cassandra weather monitoring system.'
