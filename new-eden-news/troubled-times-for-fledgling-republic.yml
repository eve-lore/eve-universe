- body: "Sebiestor tribal head Karin Midular at a press conference yesterday expressed
    disapproval on the Republic\u2019s behalf towards the People\u2019s Republic of
    Minmatar, an alliance of paramilitary groups which last Wednesday officially seceded
    from the Republic, proclaiming independence under a new constitution and claiming
    the constellation of Tartatven in the Molden Heath region as their sovereign territory.
    \  \n  \nClaiming \u201Cdisappointment at the impertinence displayed by our brethren,\u201D
    Midular then went on to state that the Minmatar Republic officially did not recognize
    the PRM\u2019s claim to sovereignty over the Tartatven constellation.   \n  \nIn
    response, PRM High Council Member Bl3ach leveled harsh criticism at the current
    Republic administration, claiming Midular\u2019s reaction had been expected from
    an administration known for its policy of \u201Chiding one\u2019s head in the
    sand and pretending that a third of our people are not still in the vile clutches
    of the Amarrians, degraded and treated as commodities.\u201D The councilman added
    that the PRM had laid its claim upon Tartatven \u201Cso that the principles and
    ideologies of our people, which seem sorely absent from the bureaucracy of the
    old Republic, may be enforced.\u201D   \n  \nDiplomatic rows aren\u2019t the only
    battles the PRM is fighting these days. The day before yesterday saw an incursion
    of ships from Amarr fundamentalist paramilitary organization CVA (Curatores Veritatis
    Alliance), on what appeared initially to have been a scouting patrol, but which
    escalated into a skirmish resulting in CVA forces retreating from Tartatven.   \n
    \ \nQuestioned for comment, CVA Grand Inquisitor Gaius Kador stated, \u201CThe
    PIE Inquisition Wing entered so-called \u201Cclaimed\u201D space to obtain intel,
    and was successful in doing so before enemy presence forced a tactical retreat.\u201D
    \  \n  \nPropagandists for both the CVA and the PRM have begun a fierce duel of
    words on the GalNet networks, and hostilities are expected to escalate in the
    coming days and weeks.   \n  \nMeanwhile, down on the planets, a shift is taking
    place. Since last week\u2019s declaration of independence, almost twenty thousand
    Matari have moved from planets in the Sveipar constellation and are taking up
    residence on Tartatven\u2019s major centers of commerce and industry, the cities
    of Argrald and New Rixarn (located on Hrober II and Aedald VI, respectively).
    This migration is seen as indicative of the growing feeling, particularly among
    younger generation Matari, that the current Republic is growing soft in its policies.
    \  \n  \nQuestioned at a press conference yesterday as to whether this recent
    trend was cause for worry for the Republic, Head of Parliament Malaetu Shakor
    replied: \u201CThe Republic does as it must, as, I am certain, does the PRM. I
    am not now, nor have I ever been, in a position to judge my fellow brothers and
    sisters for the paths they choose. Our struggle is, after all, a common one.\u201D"
