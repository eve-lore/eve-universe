- body: "Aritcio Kor-Azor, the new head of the Kor-Azor family and son of the recently
    appointed Amarr Emperor, was involved in an unspecified 'incident' at an ancient
    cathedral on his home planet of Eclipticum last week. Aritcio, which has a reputation
    of enjoying the wild side of life, rented the cathedral for himself and a group
    of his friends to engage in some 'religious festivities', as he described it.
    These 'festivities' were abruptly ended when a resident priest accidentally walked
    in on them and witnessed the 'incident'.  \n  \nFollowing this 'incident' the
    cathedral had to be thoroughly cleansed and partly renovated, it has also been
    revealed that several valuable holy artifacts in the possession of the cathedral
    had to be destroyed. Naturally, this has upset the religious community on Eclipticum
    as well as abroad. It is also understood that a foreign exchange student from
    the Gallente Federation was involved in the 'incident', though it is not known
    to what extent or purpose. She has already been shipped back to the Federation
    for medical treatment.  \n  \nThe public relations office of the Kor-Azor family
    has yet to release a statement on the matter, though one is expected in the very
    near future."
