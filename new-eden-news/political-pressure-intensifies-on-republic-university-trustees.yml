    Khuhurit, a prominent Sebiestor MP, added his voice to those questioning a research
    grant awarded to Prof. Velys Gorra by Republic University. Khukurit remarked on
    this issue during an interview with Sebiestor Tribal Broadcasting.\n\n\"There's
    quite clearly a disconnect between the University's charter and this kind of apologist
    nonsense. How is this kind of spending at all in the public interest? Research
    money should be going towards progressing Minmatar achievements, not extolling
    Amarr ones.\"  \n  \nThough he is the first MP to comment on the issue since the
    controversy began last week, several other officials have come out in support
    of his position. Some have threatened to conduct parliamentary hearings on the
    issue.  \n  \nThe Board of Trustees released a statement today, saying that research
    grants were given \"on the recommendation of University administration and faculty
    representatives,\" and claimed that the grant had seen \"almost unanimous\" approval.
    Prof. Lillaka Uithmil, leading the opposition to the grant, called the statement
    a \"dodge.\" \"Research grants should not be based on popularity contests, but
    on the social benefits they provide to the Minmatar Republic,\" she said. \"Clearly
    there was a lack of consideration for the wider impact of such a grant on the
    trustees' part.\""
