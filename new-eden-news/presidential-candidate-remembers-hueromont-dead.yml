- body: "Senator Mentas Blaque, one of two remaining candidates for the presidency
    of the Gallente Federation, yesterday paid a visit to the city of Hueromont on
    Gallente Prime. The visit was undertaken in order to commemorate the roughly fourteen
    thousand Gallente who died when Caldari Admiral Yakia Tovil-Toba flew his carrier
    into the planet\u2019s atmosphere 188 years ago, during the Gallente-Caldari war.
    The senator held a speech at the site of the calamity, after which he was toured
    by the city\u2019s mayor, Emile Touscagne, through the districts hardest hit by
    the attack.   \n  \nDuring his speech, Blaque paid tribute to the dead of Hueromont,
    urging his audience to \u201Cremember the sacrifices given by those who came before\u201D
    and to \u201Cremain alert to the presence of evils that still today lurk just
    beyond the horizon.\u201D He also encouraged Gallente citizens to \u201Ccontinue
    engaging in meaningful dialogue about our Federation and the citizen\u2019s duty
    to safeguard his homeland.\u201D   \n  \nThe senator\u2019s speech, as well as
    the occasion of his visit to Hueromont, has been criticized by liberal parties
    as deliberately inflammatory. \u201CIt seems fairly obvious that the senator\u2019s
    hateful tirade is meant to incite tensions among the good people of Hueromont,\u201D
    stated Senator Audrey Rairix, a long-time opponent of Blaque\u2019s within the
    Senate. \u201CI think it should be apparent to anyone listening that this was
    not a speech about acceptance and reconciliation. It was one of anger, mistrust,
    even vengeance.\u201D   \n  \nAmong the assembled crowd no signs of discontent
    were superficially apparent, though isolated pockets of dissenters within the
    crowd briefly vocalized their contempt before being escorted off the premises
    by guard personnel. During key moments in the speech, applause and cheering carried
    as far as outlying districts as a thousands-strong crowd roared approval at Senator
    Blaque\u2019s words.   \n  \nHueromont is today the ninth largest city in the
    Gallente Federation, with thirty-six million inhabitants in the greater metropolitan
    area. In the nearly two centuries since the Hueromont Incident, it has been generally
    regarded as a sore point for Gallente pride and remains something of a taboo subject
    in international political circles."
