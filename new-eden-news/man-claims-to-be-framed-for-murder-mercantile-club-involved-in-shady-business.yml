    difficulties prohibit her from accessing her news facilities, we hope to solve
    these issues shortly.   \n  \nIn all my years of reporting I have never been privy
    to such a display of arrogant defiance as I saw last night in the Bereye system.
    \  \n  \nFor the past few weeks now I have been following a man called Tinus Janatus,
    believing there was more to his story then met the eye.   \n  \nMr Janatus claims
    to have been framed by the Mercantile Club, for killing Gregory Malubrian nearly
    ten years previous. At first I was wary to believe him at all, but after tonight\u2019s
    events, I am starting to think his story might hold water.   \n  \nI recently
    asked Tinus to meet Mercantile Club on their own grounds. Reluctantly, he agreed.
    Several privateer vessels were asked to assist us and escort us to the Bereye
    system, where several transports were being escorted by the Mercantile Club. Tinus
    moved toward them and I publicly asked for information regarding the death of
    Gregory Malubrian and previous occasions where Raptor pilots threatened the life
    of Mr Janatus.   \n  \nThe Mercantile club refused to comment on these incidents.
    As our conversation was ending, two raptor pilots decloaked and took over the
    conversation that was going on in Bereye, moving towards Tinus as they did.   \n
    \ \nAmos Sommers, Gallent and keepiru were amongst the pilots who aided us by
    watching over Tinus whilst we spoke with the Mercantile Club escort. The idea
    to use private vessels for protection paid off and the Mercantile Club escort
    leaders and raptor pilots even though verbally hostile were not prepared to open
    fire on a group of individuals who had no affiliation to Mr Jantaus.   \n  \nJust
    as the discussion I was having in local was coming to heated peak, Amos Sommers
    asked for Tinus to align for warp in case of weapons fire. Each of them pursued
    him to the chosen gate. I continued to speak with the other representatives, to
    no avail; they were not prepared to speak of the incident a few weeks earlier
    with Tinus being fired at, nor were they prepared to explain exactly why they
    had two raptor class ships following them. Maybe a paranoid escort team, watching
    for Tinus, I don\u2019t know.   \n  \nI consider this and past events surrounding
    the death of Gregory Malubrian, evidence of the Mercantile Club's hostility toward
    Tinus. His claims about being framed for his murder may well now be true. Time
    will tell, as I strive to continue this journey to Tinus, I till hope that we
    may yet come to the bottom of what really happened ten years ago.   \nSilvia Frinor
