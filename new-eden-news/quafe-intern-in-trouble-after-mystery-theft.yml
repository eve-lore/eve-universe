    Quafe recently disappeared from the company\u2019s warehouse in the Allamotte
    system. Dune Mirmueren, a spokesman for the company, has revealed that the disappearance
    was being treated as a theft, with the prime suspect, and also sole witness, being
    a lowly intern. A reporter for the Scope managed to speak to the intern, Hared
    Loudier, before he was whisked away by Quafe officials.   \n  \nAccording to Loudier,
    a small wormhole appeared inside the warehouse, sucking out large quantities of
    Quafe. Loudiers\u2019s tale grows even stranger as he speaks of strange beings,
    most likely human, on the other side of the wormhole. The beings spoke in incoherent
    babble and were fighting amongst themselves, seemingly for the privilege to be
    the first to enter through the wormhole. Their surroundings were sparse, the only
    item of notice a green comfy-chair. \u2018It was a really nice looking chair,\u2019
    Loudier mused just before he was pulled away.   \n  \nDune Mirmueren dismissed
    Loudier\u2019s story as simply ludicrous. He said Loudier was on the ever popular
    enzyme-diet, which is known to induce hallucinations on occasions. \u2018But we
    think Mr. Loudier is spinning this whole story as a cover up to what we believe
    is a pure and simple theft,\u2019 Mirmueren continued. \u2018Men with red hair
    and green comfy chairs, pah! Anyone can see that such tales are just pure fabrication.\u2019
    Mirmueren concluded that Quafe would put every effort into locating the lost stash
    of their treasured soft drink. \u2018We will hunt down the perpetrators, through
    space and time. We will not rest until those responsible are behind bars, where
    they belong.\u2019"
