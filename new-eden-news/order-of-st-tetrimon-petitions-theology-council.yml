- body: "Grand Master Horm of the Order of St. Tetrimon has called upon the Theology
    Council to remove the privileges granted by the Cross of the Sacred Throne Order
    in a [GalNet publicized petition](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=362150),
    openly challenging the Theology Council to act. \n\nThe Grand Master named a particular
    pilot in this petition, Golan Trevize, who currently works for the Mercenary Coalition
    but is a former member of the 1st Praetorian Guard an Amarrian loyalist organisation.
    He was awarded the Cross of the Sacred Throne Order, one of the highest accolades
    in Amarr society for services to the Emperor and the Amarr Empire. This petition
    specifically targets Golan Trevize, claiming that he has turned his back on the
    Empire by putting his personal monetary interests before those of the Empire.
    \n\nThe petition, signed personally by Grand Master Horm calls for the removal
    of the Cross itself from Golan Trevize. This may also open the way for similar
    action against other pilots who have been awarded the Cross and subsequently left
    the Empire. \n\nThe petition was brought before the Theology Council, where it
    stirred heated discussions amongst the various council members and Court Chamberlain.
    Even after a full day of deliberation, the debate continued behind closed doors,
    indicative that there are strong opinions being expressed about this matter. Deacon
    Lorenzo Azir has called for an outright dismissal of the petition due to the public
    manner by which it was delivered to them. \n\nThe Sacred Throne Order was originally
    a secret group of the Emperor's most loyal followers during the moral reforms,
    when the Council of Apostles contested the power of the Emperor. The Cross of
    the Sacred Throne Order honours this old promise to Loyalty, and is only awarded
    to those Amarrian individuals who go above and beyond the call of duty to the
    Amarr Empire. \n\nThe Order of St. Tetrimon may also have ulterior motives in
    delivering this petition to the Theology Council. Political analysts predict that
    by disrupting the operations of the Theology Council with this difficult issue,
    Tetrimon are making an open political move against them which may spur other groups
    opposed to the Theology Council into action. \n\nIt is however unlikely that the
    other parties involved, apart from Tetrimon and Golan Trevize, will seek to publicize
    their actions during this troublesome period."
