- body: "After a temporary lull in fighting, Guristas pirates launched a new wave
    of attacks on the Crielere compound today. The research lab is being defended
    by a brave multinational force summoned by the scientists holding out in the compound.
    Swarms of missiles could be seen closing in on defenders as the final pirate ships
    retreated from the war zone.   \n  \nThe defensive force seems to have driven
    the Guristas into the neighboring system of Rancer. Considerable pirate forces
    have also been spotted in the Miroitem system. The pirates are thought to be consolidating
    their forces and preparing for a final assault on the compound. Military analysts
    have estimated that Guristas will stay out of Crielere \u201Cfor several days\u201D
    while they gather enough strength to take out the brave defenders of Crielere.
    A spokesman for the Gallente Federation Navy was quoted as saying \u201Cthese
    are brave people. The scientists seem to be in good hands. We wish them the best
    of luck\u201D. The Federation Navy has orders to stay out of the conflict and
    Navy ships are nowhere to be seen at this former hub of Gallente innovation.   \n
    \ \nCommunications with the facility has been limited as the resident science
    crew is scrambling to repair damages to the central fission core in order to contain
    the volatile morphite plasma being researched there. There are reports of several
    crew casualties. After hours of pounding by pirate missiles yesterday, a sector
    of the lab lost power and started leaking oxygen. It was hastily sealed but in
    the ensuing chaos several research assistants were forgotten and were left inside
    as the oxygen was transferred to the undamaged parts of the facility. Among them
    was the young Quafe Intellectual Merit awardee Kaiman Gunaris, a mathematical
    genius famous for proving the millennia-old Ki-Pi conjecture.   \n  \nThe Gallentean
    Institute of Practical Mathematics has issued a statement where it regrets this
    \u201Ctotally unnecessary waste of human life\u201D and calls for Crielere lead
    scientists Henric Touvolle and Taromi Umailen to \u201Cgive in to the grim facts
    of life and abandon this failed experiment in academic optimism\u201D. \u201CGunaris
    gave this society so much and could have given more, had it not been for the stubbornness
    and intellectual pride of senior scientists who should have known better\u201D."
