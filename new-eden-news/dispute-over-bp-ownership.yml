- body: A dispute has arisen between the Gallente Federation and the Caldari State
    on one hand and the Jovians on the other. In exchange for Jovian assistance in
    the construction of the massive research facilities in the Crielere system the
    Jovians received a number of blueprints, including an original miner II BP. The
    Federation and the State are furious that some of these blueprints got into circulation
    following the Ouria fiasco and are accusing the Jovians of incompetence, and even
    deliberate sabotage of the research efforts in Crielere. They are demanding that
    the Jovians return the blueprints still in their possession back to Crielere.
    The situation is very volatile at the moment, as accusations have also started
    flying between the Gallenteans and the Caldari. Diplomats from all sides will
    meet in the next few days to try and find a suitable solution to the crisis.
