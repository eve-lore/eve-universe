- body: SYSTEM 35-RK9 - The Intaki Syndicate Bureau station in the 35-RK9 system has
    been struck by a powerful radiological pulse--the third confirmed event of its
    kind today. Impacting at 16 AU's from its sun, the timing of the blast coincides
    with other reported main-sequence anomalies. There are no reported casualties,
    but Syndicate spokesman Rhin Dovaille stated that the pulse was powerful enough
    to temporarily knock out electrical grids. Shielding systems were also brought
    down nearly to zero but held. He added that their distance from the local sun
    was what likely spared their lives.
