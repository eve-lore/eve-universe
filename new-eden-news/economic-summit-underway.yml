- body: "Malkalen - To the enthusiastic applause of all in attendance, including the
    hundreds of reporters and camera drones present, Federation Economic Minister
    Wadis Chene and Ishukone CEO Otro Gariushi began the session with an embrace.
    The emotional welcoming was symbolic of the two nations' efforts to reduce racial
    tensions and strengthen economic ties. Also in attendance were various guests
    from Ishukone, all of whom expressed interest in meeting with Federation delegates
    in advance. \n\nFollowing the handshakes, the summit commenced with a question
    and answer session with Otro Gariushi and Wadis Chene. Both officials expressed
    deep regret at the recent escalations in ethnic violence, conceded mutual blame
    for its origins, and accepted responsibility in taking the necessary steps to
    prevent it from happening again. \n\nWhen asked directly if he was attempting
    to supersede Tibus Heth's aggressive 'power play' entrance into Caldari politics,
    Otro Gariushi answered that he \"wasn't aware of any power contests in this part
    of the State\", drawing a chuckle from the audience that quickly evolved into
    full-blown cheering from the Ishukone crowd. More seriously, he added that he
    planned to hold Tibus at his word to give the peace process a chance. \n\nA gala
    reception began following the session. Formal negotiations will begin tomorrow,
    during which time details about the proposal will be released to media channels."
