- body: "_Reported by HighBirdDeuce_   \n  \nOn the steps leading to the atrium at
    the Playboy Enterprises Offices at the Calle School at Egghelende, the press was
    at a fevered pitch upon the announcement of the Playmate of the Year.   \n  \nAs
    Heff mounted the Podium dressed in his red smoking jacket, slippers surrounded
    by a bevy of beauties, all past winners of the monthly contest, a hush fell over
    the crowd.   \n  \n\u201CI am very pleased to announce this year\u2019s winner
    of the Playmate of the Year goes to Ms. Victoria Madison!\u201D   \n  \nAt that,
    the veiled red stain curtain fell from a gold encrusted easel to reveal Ms. Madison\u2019s
    cover photo for the year end issue. This brings to a close a turbulent year for
    the Playboy after rumors of an internal investigation found charges of embezzlement
    and fraud leveled at some subordinates.   \n  \n\u201CWe have put that matter
    to an end and assure our readership that it was nothing more then an unauthorized
    drill by a few of our accounting staff. Those jokers just don\u2019t know when
    to quit,\u201D Heff stated at the after party.   \n  \n\u201CThe real star attraction
    is Ms. Madison,\u201D said Heff. \u201CShe\u2019ll have bragging rights for the
    whole year.\u201D"
