- body: "Luminaire \u2013 Reports released today by Federal Administration revealed
    a sharp rise in personal and property violence across the Federation in the month
    following the Caldari incursion. \n\nThe most striking numbers in the report are
    those from Luminaire itself. Vandalism and property crimes rose 16% from the previous
    six-month average. Personal crimes (assault, robbery and homicide) have also increased
    \u2013 averaging 6% higher than over the previous half year. \n\nUniversity of
    Caille professor Jules Lechard, author of _Crime \u2013 A Study in Contrasts_
    , attributes the sharp rise to increased stress and uncertainty as to the future
    of the tense stand-off in Luminaire, as well as general anxiety in response to
    the advent of stellar war. \n\n\"It is not at all unusual in times of uncertainty
    for criminal activity to spike,\" said Lechard in a remote interview. \"A certain
    percentage of the population will always jump to the worst case scenario, and
    thus will see no further point in conforming to the norms of society.\" \n\nLechard
    hastened to reassure readers that the chances of an individual Federation citizen
    being a victim of crime remain quite low. \"This does not signal the end of civilization.
    It's important to keep perspective on such things,\" he stated emphatically. \"As
    an average Luminairian, your chance of being killed by someone you do not know
    remains at historically low levels.\" \n\nProfessor Lechard expressed confidence
    that, for better or worse, once the citizens of the Federation adjust to the new
    status quo the crime statistics should return close to normal values. In fact,
    he stated there is a possibility that crime rates could even dip in the face of
    increased national pride."
