- body: "The ethnic violence throughout the Caldari State and Gallente Federation
    is a source of concern for many, and a source of satisfaction to some. Although
    Otro Gariushi's pleas for peace seem to have had some effect, some wonder how
    long it will last. \n\nAnti-Gallente feelings have been building for many years.
    As Malcentis Tal asserted: _\u201CI am utterly appalled by this undermining of
    the Caldari State. This state has kept us safe from our enemies. This state has
    allowed us to prosper and raise families. This state fought for our freedom from
    Gallentean oppression. Now as true patriots fight again against insidious Gallentean
    fifth columnists we will see who stands up to be counted and who lays down before
    our enemies.\u201D_ Malcentis\u2019 feelings are echoed by a pod pilot named Thorradin;
    _\u201CWe Caldari have changed, for the worse, since we began mingling so heavily
    with the Gallente and other races. Heth said of the Gallente what many already
    thought, and the Gallente responded by showing what kind of people they are.\u201D_\n\nMore
    moderate members of the community feel that both parties are to blame for the
    issues at hand. Talaris EveningStar believes that, _\u201CWhile The Gallente may
    have taught us, by proxy, the ideas of corruption on some level, they are not
    to blame. We have only one place to point our finger, and that is at ourselves.
    The corruption is Caldari people, abusing Caldari people. Disgracing and dishonoring
    the very ideals that we left the Federation to defend. This is our disease, and
    we must recover ourselves.\u201D_\n\nWhile many pod pilots sit back and watch
    the events unfolding from afar, some have been touched more intimately and have
    decided to assist in whatever way they can. Silver Night told us about a crewman,
    _\u201Ca drone maintenance officer who is ethnically Intaki although his family
    has lived in the State since the war. They are citizens and patriotic supporters
    of the Caldari way of life. His father - who owns a small shop - was recently
    assaulted and hospitalized by a gang of thugs. This kind of senseless violence
    and hate has to stop.\u201D_ Silver tells us that his crew has collected over
    600 thousand isk for donation to the relief efforts on Caldari Prime. \n\nDex
    Nederland is also rendering assistance; _\u201CThe Heiian Society continues to
    bring relief aid to the Caldari on Caldari Prime from all across the cluster and
    contributed by people from all walks of life. This includes daily runs on my part
    and others to the Federation Station above Caldari Prime.\u201D_\n\nThebro Nobrunder
    has also offered aid, but in a different form: _\u201CI have personally put out
    word that any Gallente in Caldari space whom are afraid and wish escape can contact
    me. I will transport as many as possible to neutral systems.\u201D_\n\nWhile relief
    efforts are under way, military organizations such as The Fourth District are
    in a heightened state of awareness. As Captain Svetlana Scarlet tells us: _\u201CAt
    the moment, thanks to the efforts of the brave men and women of the corporate
    security forces, this unrest appears to be coming to an end. There appears to
    be no need for the Fourth District to step in, and of course we would not do so
    unless the CEP or another official entity asked us to. However, we are maintaining
    a state of readiness should we be called upon... Caldari Prime is sovereign Federation
    territory according to the Iyen-Oursta treaty and therefore it is an internal
    Federation issue. While we urge the Federation to deal with this problem swiftly
    and with as little loss of life as possible, and of course condemn any discrimination
    against Caldari expatriates on the planet, we will not be getting involved in
    the matter unless requested to by State authorities.\u201D_\n\nThe deteriorating
    political situation is likely to hamper relief efforts, but all organizations
    currently providing aid are asked to continue to do so."
