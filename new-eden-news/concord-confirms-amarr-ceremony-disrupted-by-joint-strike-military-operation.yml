- body: "**AMARR** \u2013 CONCORD authorities today confirmed that several military
    Special Forces units \u201Cfrom traditionally opposing factions\u201D converged
    on the Theology Council Tribunal station during the Amarr Championship Award Ceremony
    and engaged in a fierce firefight that left all of the elite tactical units, dozens
    of station security personnel, and 7 high-ranking advisors and military officers
    loyal to Doriam Kor-Azor dead. No survivors were left at the scene, and the identities
    of the attackers are unknown. CONCORD crime scene investigators revealed that
    there were at least three different \u201Ctactical unit teams\u201D involved in
    the fight: Two were exclusively comprised of Amarr elements, and the other was
    exclusively Minmatar.  \n\n\n\u201CThe Amarr teams arrived on separate days sometime
    before the actual day of the awards. One team was posing as engineers, the other
    as priests, of all things,\u201D stated Kedrick Brannon of CONCORD\u2019s Criminal
    Investigations Task Force. \u201CThe third team arrived in a Bestower at about
    1500 GMT the day of the awards as slaves, shackled and processed like normal.
    They had help from the inside, because about 20 minutes after their arrival they
    were loose and armed to the teeth. Someone must have stowed weapons for them somewhere
    in the station ahead of time. The Amarr authorities got a hold of that Bestower
    skipper before we could, by the way. No one\u2019s heard from him since.\u201D
    \ \n\n\nWhen asked what the commando\u2019s objective was, Brannon answered \u201CWell,
    that\u2019s the interesting part. A lot of Kor-Azor brass was aboard for the award
    ceremony, and it seems that the \u2018objective\u2019 had to do with them. Whether
    they intended to interrogate them, force them to access classified information,
    or steal some physical possessions, we just don\u2019t know. The intel guys are
    fairly certain that several of Kor-Azor\u2019s people had \u2018intimate knowledge\u2019
    of Heideran\u2019s \u2018ghost ship\u2019\u2014the battleship coffin that Chamberlain
    Karsoth mentioned during the award ceremony.  \n\n\n\u201CBut what we were shocked
    to find out was that all three teams were there for the same thing, acting on
    the exact same intelligence, planned almost identical tactical missions, yet were
    completely independent of one another. They were all sent by different entities
    that we\u2019re still trying to discover. All of them reached the officer\u2019s
    deck at almost the exact same time. We have camera footage showing the three teams
    pointing their rifles at each other, nervously switching targets back and forth
    between opposite teams, screaming to lower their weapons. Meanwhile, Kor-Azor\u2019s
    people are all face down on the floor with their hands behind their heads\u2026it
    was just a surreal scene.\u201D  \n\n\n\u201CThe astonishing thing is that it
    was one of the Amarr squads that fired first, and at the other Amarr squad, no
    less. The room erupted in gunfire. The camera footage stops abruptly, but not
    before it captured some pretty graphic scenes, too gory to reveal here. Not more
    than two or three minutes after that firefight started, all of the gates leading
    into the Amarr system mysteriously malfunctioned, and ships trying to undock from
    stations within the Amarr system had their camera drones locked down. Then the
    entire ceremony was moved to a closed comms channel, presumably for security reasons.
    Although the Amarrs emphatically deny having anything to do with the gate malfunctions
    and drone lockdown, we\u2019re looking into the matter closely.\u201D  \n\n\nAsked
    why the commandos would choose the day of the award ceremony to launch the attack,
    Brannon answered \u201CWe\u2019re baffled by that decision ourselves. There were
    hundreds of ships parked in orbit around Amarr Prime waiting for the ceremony
    to begin when they attacked. There was a much higher volume of ship traffic than
    usual at all three stations in the system at that time. It\u2019s clear that the
    congregation of Kor-Azor personnel presented such an enticing \u2018target of
    opportunity\u2019 for the commandos that whomever sent them decided it was worth
    the risk.\u201D  \n\n\nOn whether or not there were survivors: \u201CNone whatsoever,
    and all of the Kor-Azor officers\u20147 in all\u2014were killed, some by crossfire,
    some intentionally executed. And make sure the record states that the coroner
    is pulling Amarr bullets from their corpses, not Minmatar ones. The room and adjacent
    hallways were the battle took place is a forensic ballistics nightmare, a total
    war zone. Between the limited camera footage and the analysis of the scene, we\u2019ve
    also determined that one of the Amarr teams and the sole Minmatar team was actually
    working _with_ each other _against_ the second Amarr team, and then finally against
    the station security personnel, who eventually overwhelmed them. We don\u2019t
    know how they planned on escaping, if at all, but it was clear that they had no
    intentions of being taken alive.\u201D  \n\n\nAudio transcripts of the camera
    footage are currently classified \u201Cdue to the extremely volatile nature of
    the situation\u201D and that \u201Canalysis of the audio has brought to light
    some sensitive information that would hurt the current investigation if released
    to the public prematurely\u201D, undoubtedly implying that there are some leads
    as to who is responsible for the attacks."
