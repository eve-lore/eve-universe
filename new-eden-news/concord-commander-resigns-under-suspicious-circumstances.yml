- body: "Over the last couple of days, rumours surrounding the recent departure of
    ex-CONCORD Commander Gispali Rhatal have been spreading throughout the cluster.
    In the last few hours a source close to CONCORD has confirmed that there are several
    inexplicable inconsistencies in Rhatal\u2019s internal file.   \n  \nThe contents
    of the file corroborate the information already circulating about Gispali \u2013
    his term of service, terminated on the 4th of this month, spanned thirty-two years,
    during which period he maintained a relatively undistinguished profile. However,
    there is no information listed on his activities over an extended time period.
    More significantly, rather than being simply classified as is the usual procedure
    for CONCORD operations, the relevant area is simply blank, as is the log of his
    letter of resignation. The unnamed source asserts that the CONCORD personnel division
    nominally responsible for Mr Rhatal has no prior records relating to him, and
    have been unsuccessful in their requests for any additional information to explain
    the situation. CONCORD media contacts and numerous highly-placed officers have
    uniformly failed to respond to solicitations for comment on this issue which has
    only served to fuel speculation surrounding it."
