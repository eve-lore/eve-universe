- body: "Stargate technicians are working overtime tonight in Orvolle, after the automated
    sentry guns failed to stop an attack on a Viator class transport ship.   \n  \nIn
    addition to their failure to engage, logging systems also did not catch the identities
    of the 6 ships which attacked and destroyed the Viator, although eyewitnesses
    say that the party consisted of a Helios, a Raven, a Stabber, a Vigil, another
    unidentified ship and most oddly, an Iteron class V industrial cargo vessel.   \n
    \ \nThe failure of these 2 critical systems points towards sabotage as the cause.
    This however cannot be confirmed until the technicians have completed their analysis.
    The pilot who fell victim to the fatal attack is also being sought for questioning
    but officials are baffled as he disappeared mere moments after the activation
    of his clone.   \n  \nSpeaking in a press conference, the chief of security for
    Orvolle said, \"these people are despicable, nomatter how clever they may have
    been in this instance we will find them. Violence and murder will not be tolerated
    here, nor anywhere else.\""
