- body: Only a few hours ago representatives from two corporations met with a heavily
    armed Jovian delegation in the FDZ4-A system. The identity of the two representatives
    remains hidden, as is the purpose for the meeting. It is speculated that some
    kind of a trade took place, the nature of which is unknown, though speculations
    are ripe. To uphold the secrecy of the meeting the Jovians were unwilling to do
    business until the surrounding area had been cleared of all but those participating
    in the discussion. It quickly became obvious that the Jovians were very serious
    about this, as they fired upon ships that came too close. In one incident, a brave
    Amarr captain defied the Jovians only to be annihilated by the Jovians. The Amarr
    Empire has released a statement where it laments the attack, but will not act
    upon it, though it will monitor all future dealings between Jovians and Amarrians
    very closely. It is believed that CONCORD representatives were also present, but
    whether a statement is to be expected from them remains to be seen.
