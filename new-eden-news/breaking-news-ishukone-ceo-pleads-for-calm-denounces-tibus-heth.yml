    Ishukone, secured nation-wide broadcast rights to make an emotional appeal for
    calm in the Caldari State, renouncing ethnic violence and calling Heth\u2019s
    actions \"unnecessary, selfish, and unspeakably dangerous\". The announcement
    follows escalating racial tensions between the Caldari State and Gallente Federation,
    whose expatriates have both been targets of ethnic violence in recent days. Gariushi\u2019s
    influence seems to have worked, at least on Caldari Prime, where hostilities have
    ceased. \n\nA full transcript of his speech is below: \n\nCaldarians, I have come
    before you to deliver this message: Those of you who are attacking Gallenteans
    right now, you are enemies of this State. I take no pride in having to ask you
    this, but please\u2026stop what you\u2019re doing\u2026 take a step back\u2026
    and remember your humanity. You have anger\u2014so do I. We\u2019ve been reminded
    of our failure, as a nation, to live up to the expectation of the Caldari ideal.
    We\u2019ve made mistakes\u2014ones that we can correct\u2014but this is not the
    way. \n\nOur problems come from within. Not from outside of our borders, and not
    in the past that we\u2019re ashamed of. Tibus Heth showed you the extent of executive
    greed in our system of governance. He demonstrated that the elites of this nation
    have failed to create wealth in a way that benefits those who have labored the
    most to produce it. In the Caldari State, opportunities are created through the
    work of good men and women. Good people. Not animals. Good human beings. Not savages.
    We are people who take responsibility for our actions, and we are people who believe
    that others should be held accountable for theirs. \n\nBut Tibus Heth is wrong.
    He wants a scapegoat. He wants change through hate. He revealed just how fragile
    this\u2026this concept we call \u2018civilization\u2019 is when you test the limits
    of people\u2019s patience. It\u2019s true that some people did some horrible things\u2026evil
    people who purposely sought to insult us right at our core, to strike directly
    into our hearts. But to you on Caldari Prime, or anywhere else in this State,
    don\u2019t let yourself play into the hands of a tyrant. Don\u2019t let him lead
    you down this path, because I promise you, it will lead to disaster. \n\nYou know
    my past. You know I\u2019ve never backed down from a fight. But for the sake of
    this generation, don\u2019t confuse rationality with cowardice. Heth\u2019s appeal
    to hatred is unnecessary, selfish, and unspeakably dangerous. Now, I\u2019m promising
    all of you that we will find those responsible for these malicious acts on Caldari
    Prime and prosecute them to the full extent of the law. And then we\u2019ll find
    those who misled the finances of the mega-corporations for personal gain, and
    they will be held to account for their greed. \n\nFrom the moment I took this
    post, I have governed Ishukone with the interests of its workers ahead of my own.
    I commend Tibus Heth for exposing the flaws of mega-corporate governance. But
    I condemn him for inciting us into anarchy. We are destined for greater things
    than this. Our path should have never led us here. There is a better way. But
    you must step back from what you\u2019re doing now, or else we\u2019ll lose everything
    that we have left of ourselves. \n\nI\u2019m asking each of you\u2014in fact,
    I\u2019m demanding it, in the name of this State\u2014to be calm. Return to work,
    to school, to the tasks that we chose on our own accord. You looked to me for
    guidance once before; now I\u2019m imploring you to trust me again. Follow me.
    Follow the example of Ishukone. We can make this State stronger\u2026we can be
    united in purpose\u2026but we will never, ever be united in hate. \n\n\\---"
