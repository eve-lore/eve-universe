    of Lord Ardishapur's speaking engagements have continued to rise, with events
    now selling out stadium-sized venues and being broadcast to millions system-wide.
    The engagements have not been without some controversy, however, as some claim
    the Heir has overstepped the traditional bounds of his power.\n\nThe claims began
    after an incident in Dantan, where two long-feuding Holders approached the Royal
    Heir for advice to resolve their dispute. According to one of the Holders, they
    \"have been unable to find satisfaction in other public courts.\" Lord Ardishapur
    agreed to hear them and listened as each man listed his grievances with his neighbor.\n\nOnce
    they had finished, the Heir prefaced his opinions by the reminder that, \"Any
    words I say here are merely a suggestion, as it is beyond my power to bind your
    actions. Only Lord Kador, your liege-lord, holds that authority.\" The Royal Heir
    then laid out his understanding of their grievance and offered several suggestions,
    including a complicated, large-scale swap of territory that the Heir claimed \"would
    resolve many of your issues.\"\n\nSeveral high ranking Amarr officials have claimed
    that such an act undermines the authority of Lord Kador and the Theology Council,
    before whom the two Holders have argued many times. The Holders dispute this contention,
    one claiming, \"Had I thought poorly of Lord Ardishapur, I could simply ignore
    his suggestions.\"\n\nLord Ardishapur himself says there was no harm intended
    with his actions. \"These are his subjects alone and I have no hold over them.
    I would never attempt to usurp the rightful power of the Heirs.\"\n\nFor his part,
    Lord Kador appears to be pleased that the dispute has been resolved, claiming,
    \"If only Lord Ardishapur had been here before, hundreds of hours may have not
    been wasted on those two.\""
