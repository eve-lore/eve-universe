- body: "In recent days, word has spread throughout the Caldari corporate community
    that Zainou Biotech, one of the State's leading biotechnology corporations, has
    suffered a massive security breach.   \n  \nAccording to rumours, two leading
    scientists from within the biotech giant's inner circle of research and development
    have gone away without leave, reportedly in possession of a highly classified
    experimental drug taken from the corporation's main laboratories in Isseras. The
    drug, known only as \"Insorum,\" is reportedly a mild euphoric whose short duration
    and lack of immediately apparent side effects make it ideal for black market sale
    in mass quantities. The pair, pharmacologist Ullia Hnolku and his wife, graviton
    physicist Eckarine Mitumi-Hnolku, have neither been seen nor heard from in three
    days.   \n  \nAccording to Chief Executive Panel sources, the CEP Business Bureau
    intends to launch a full-scale investigation into the matter within the next few
    days. No official comment has been made by either the CEP or Zainou Biotech.   \n
    \ \nMeanwhile, the rumour mill has taken its toll. Zainou Biotech stock within
    Caldari markets has in the past two days plummeted by 22 points (the largest drop
    by any Caldari corporation this year so far), and at least three big-name clients
    are known to have submitted void applications to the Caldari Business Tribunal
    with intent to rift their long-standing agreements with the biotech company.   \n
    \ \n\"If they can't be trusted to hold on to their employees, how can we trust
    them to hold to their agreements?\" stated an anonymous source from one of the
    voiding parties.   \n  \nZainou, a subsidiary of the Ishukone Corporation, has
    been at the leading edge of the State's biotech and nanomechanical industries
    for years, and turns over billions of ISK annually. How much this incident will
    affect them remains to be seen."
