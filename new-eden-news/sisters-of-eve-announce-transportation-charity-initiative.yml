    on reports of thousands of emancipated slaves still stranded within the Amarr
    Empire, the Servant Sisters of EVE have announced their intention to provide a
    transportation service to the Minmatar Republic's immigration centres which will
    be free of charge to all formerly enslaved citizens. The service, similar to that
    run by InterBus, will operate from Rens and run on an as-needed basis to any system
    within the Empire.\n\n'We recognize that not all of the released slaves can afford
    the costs of a shuttle flight; many may not even know how to go about arranging
    one,' Sister Nivine Kirolyen said in a statement issued yesterday. 'We ask not
    only for assistance and cooperation in locating groups of former slaves who may
    not be able to leave the Empire, but for charitable donations which will help
    make this transport initiative possible.'\n\nThe Sisters of EVE are a neutral
    aid organization providing humanitarian relief around the cluster."
