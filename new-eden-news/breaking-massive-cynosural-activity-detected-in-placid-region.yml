    Region \u2013 Large-scale cynosural beacon activity has been detected in the Placid
    region, apparently centered on the Intaki system, according to reports confirmed
    by the Scope in the last few moments.\n\nCynosural activity seems to be at its
    most intense in the Intaki system but has been detected in a broad swathe of Placid
    systems bordering the Verge Vendor and Syndicate regions.\n\nIt is unclear at
    this time who or what is the source of this unprecedented massive cynosural activity
    in systems subject to militia warzone fighting between the Federation and State.
    Although these systems are considered Gallente Federation territory by virtue
    of the Yulai Accords and Convention many have been under extended occupation by
    the Caldari State's forces.\n\nThe Scope will continue monitoring this rapidly
    developing situation."
