- body: "Yulai - Minmatar research and development firm, Core Complexion Inc, held
    a press conference today at the CONCORD HQ in Yulai in which they revealed that
    an extended research project for a new class of ship was nearing completion. When
    asked by the attending procession of press for specific details Core Complexion
    declined to release any information on what those ships might be and remained
    tight-lipped. \"The only thing we are willing to disclose at this time is that
    they will revolutionize small-scale, high-mobility engagements.\" \n\nCONCORD
    itself was similarly reluctant to share information, though they did reveal that
    the design documents turned over by Core Complexion were for a \"frigate-sized
    vessel intended to supplement small fleet warfare.\" This unusual amount of secrecy
    surrounding the new ship design has raised the ire of many of Core Complexion's
    competing ship designers in the other empires. \n\nViziam and Carthum Conglomerate
    released a joint statement, raising their collective concerns that \"the refusal
    by Core Complexion and CONCORD to turn over vital ship technology is blatantly
    counter to the treaty signed at Yulai, specifically the article known as Directive
    Alpha Gamma 12. This is most disturbing and unless this action is undone, it will
    set a dangerous precedent that will destroy years of scientific cooperation between
    the four empires, as well as lead to an unbalancing of the peace that exists between
    us.\" \n\nCore Complexions, when faced with the charges, responded, \"Alpha Gamma
    12 does not revoke a company's right to secure its business interests and investments
    into future advances. We will fully comply with the directive once we have fully
    tested the technology, secured the proper patents from CONCORD, and insured that
    our production lines are ready to produce the new ships.\" \n\nCONCORD itself
    guardedly agreed with Core Complexions' stance, saying, \"At present, we do not
    believe the designs presented by Core Complexions reveal a completed technology.
    Once it does, then Directive Alpha Gamma 12 will come into play.\" \n\nDirective
    Alpha Gamma 12 is a much-discussed piece of legislation that was added into the
    Yulai Accords late in the negotiations of the document. Theoretically, the Directive
    forces new technological developments to be shared equally among all four Empires
    as soon as a working model of the technology has been developed. Viziam has, in
    the past, raised objections that, under a strict reading of the directive, CONCORD
    is required to monitor and report technological advances as soon as they are made,
    regardless of the existence of a prototype."
