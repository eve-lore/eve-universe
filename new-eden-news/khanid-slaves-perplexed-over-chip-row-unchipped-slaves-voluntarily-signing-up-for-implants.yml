- body: "The chip deal between the Caldari State and the Khanid Kingdom has sparked
    a fierce debate about slavery in the modern world and thrust the slaves within
    the Kingdom unexpectedly into the limelight. Advocates for implanting slaves with
    the revolutionary chip have emphasized that the slaves become happier and more
    productive as a result of being implanted. While critics of this procedure have
    not been able to thwart this argument they still claim that the implanting is
    inhumane and barbaric. But what does the common slave within the Kingdom think?
    Various news agencies have entered the Kingdom to find out just that. And the
    replies are startling: the vast majority of the implanted slaves interviewed assure
    reporters that they are happy with their lot in life, with the way they\u2019re
    treated and the work they do. Though obviously severely delusional, for instance
    insisting they have a family that is \u2018on a vacation at the moment\u2019 and
    that they\u2019re next in line for a lucrative promotion that is \u2018just around
    the corner\u2019, they are on the whole content and calm. The fact that they\u2019re
    \u2018re-programmed\u2019, wiping the slate clean, every day means they never
    question why their families never return from the vacation, etc. It also invites
    absurd situations, such as witnessed by Anya Dechant, reporter for the Scope,
    as the slaves start each morning greeting each other like they\u2019re meeting
    for the first time. Dechant explains: \u2018It\u2019s eerie watching their behavior,
    because it seems so natural and uninhibited. They laugh and jest with each other,
    work diligently and talk about their families and future like any other free people.
    You only notice it\u2019s artificial when you hear the same jokes, the same discussions
    the next day and the next day. I don\u2019t know, on one hand I pity them for
    this, but I can\u2019t help but envy them a little bit, the joy and camaraderie
    is like I\u2019ve never seen anywhere else.\u2019  \n  \nWhat is even more startling
    is that slaves within the Kingdom are voluntarily lining up to be implanted. Dechant
    talked to Rufur Argotok, a fifth generation Minmatar slave, on why he wanted to
    be implanted: \u2018Many of my friends have already been implanted and I\u2019ve
    seen how happy and content they are. Sure, I know what I\u2019m getting into,
    but I\u2019d much rather be duped into thinking I\u2019m free than live in misery
    where dying young is the best you can hope for. I\u2019m sick and tired of hearing
    the whine of sofa-socialists in the Federation and the Republic about ethics and
    human rights. These people have no idea what\u2019s really going on down here,
    sitting in their Ivory Towers blind to anything else but their own social superiority.
    They\u2019re just as bad as religious fanatics, automatically assuming that their
    way is the right way, they\u2019re ignorance and prejudice makes me sick!\u2019
    Argotok\u2019s feelings are shared by many of his fellow slaves, feelings that
    critics of slavery are not making any worthwhile gestures or suggestions on how
    to better the lot of slaves and that the Transcranial Microcontrollers, while
    not an ideal solution, is far better than any alternatives."
