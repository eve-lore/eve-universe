- body: '3HQC-6 0855 - Fluid router traffic linking a remote ORE expedition in Outer
    Ring with its headquarters in the Heart Constellation has been severed following
    reports of an emergency. Although ORE was unavailable for official comment, SCOPE
    has learned that the mining corporation dispatched a small task force to the Sword
    Constellation to investigate.


    The lost expedition is believed to be prospecting on 3HQC-6 I, the system''s innermost
    planet. Establishing fluid router communications is standard operating procedure
    for any remote mining or surveying operation, and disruption of established links
    is most commonly caused by equipment failures or accidents.


    The expedition is believed to have been performing deep core surveys on the planet''s
    interior when the emergency was sounded.'
