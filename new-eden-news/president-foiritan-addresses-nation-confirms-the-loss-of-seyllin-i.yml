- body: "LUMINAIRE - President Foiritan has just issued an internationally broadcast
    address to New Eden. The transcript is as follows:  \n  \n\"Citizens of the Federation,
    fellow souls of New Eden.  \n  \n\"It is with unspeakable regret and sorrow that
    I must deliver to you the news that we had hoped to never hear. Though we may
    have hoped that we could have prepared ourselves for this moment, I believe I
    speak on behalf of us all in saying that this catastrophe is the realization of
    our worst nightmares.  \n  \n\"By my order, all rescue efforts have been suspended,
    and no recovery efforts will be permitted. It is true that the main-sequence anomaly
    of Seyllin has caused the effective destruction of the planet.   \n  \n\"The decision
    to withhold that information and detain the reporters who sought to deliver such
    news was my own. Given the limited amount of time we had to pull people out, maintaining
    as orderly an evacuation as possible was given the highest priority.   \n  \n\"It
    is a small consolation that we were able to save some people. But it will haunt
    me for the rest of my days that we could not save them all.  \n  \n\"Scientists
    are still struggling to understand exactly what has happened. My instincts tell
    me that any explanation will provide little comfort.  \n  \n\"I would like to
    thank all those who offered their assistance in our time of need.  \n  \n\"As
    we have more information, we will share it. But if you'll please join me in a
    moment of silence for the half billion souls who just perished, I would be most
    grateful.\""
