- body: "High-ranking CONCORD officials have accused several prominent Caldari weapon
    manufacturers of promoting war and violence in many parts of the world. The Caldari
    armament industry has in recent years increasingly turned its eyes outside the
    State to do business, as the domestic market dwindles. Though most of these exports
    go to legitimate sources it is estimated that as much as 20% ends up in the hands
    of the less scrupulous social elements.   \n  \nCONCORD has many times in the
    past issued stern warnings to several Caldari corporations regarding trade with
    unsavory entities, reminding them that there are regulations that forbid such
    dealings. Yet the trade continues, often disguised as aid relief or sample containers.
    It has become clear that as long as the powers that be within the Caldari State
    turn a blind eye on this situation, then there is little that CONCORD can do to
    remedy it."
