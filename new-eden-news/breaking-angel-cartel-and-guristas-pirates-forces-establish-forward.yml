    *Above: Guristas Pirates Forward Operating Base orbits Renarelle V*\n\n### BREAKING:
    Angel Cartel and Guristas Pirates Forces Establish \"Forward Operating Bases\"
    in Warzones\n\nFloseswin, Metropolis and Renarelle, Placid \u2013 Pirate \"Forward
    Operating Bases\" have been detected in the war-torn systems of Floseswin in the
    Amarr-Minmatar militia warzone, and Renarelle in the Caldari-Gallente warzone.
    CONCORD conflict monitors sounded the alarm as scouts from the Republic Fleet
    and Federation Navy are reported to have probed the newly-appeared pirate structures
    for weaknesses.\n\nThe appearance of an Angel Cartel FOB in orbit of the temperate
    planet of Floseswin IV has rapidly caused alarm across the civilian population
    of a Minmatar border world that has experienced much devastation since the House
    [Sarum invasion of the planet in late YC121](https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/minmatar-militia-makes-gains-in-warzone-as-sarum-assault-on-floseswin-iv-continues).
    A brutal months long campaign of occupation, counter-offensive, and eventual liberation
    was carried out against the background of Triglavian invasions. Episodes of violence
    such as raids by Sarum holdouts and orbital bombardment by renegades during the
    Equilibrium of Mankind Crisis of YC123 have only served to prolong the instability
    despite a substantial Republic military presence and efforts to fortify population
    centers.\n\nIn Renarelle, a Guristas Pirates FOB has appeared in the orbital zone
    of the planet of Renarelle V, also a temperate world with a colonial population
    primarily occupied in various mining, industrial, and research enterprises. Renarelle
    V has a garrison of Federal Marines and has been noted in recent years as a hotbed
    of revolutionary activity. [Accusations of the planetary assembly collaborating
    with Caldari occupation forces in YC124](https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/galactic-hour-news-roundup-sanmatar-maleatu-shakor-confirmed-by-tribal-assembly)
    led to closer scrutiny by Federal authorities when Gallente control was re-asserted.
    The reaction of local civilian to the Guristas presence has been muted with the
    heavily-armed frontier colonists apparently ready to look to their own defence.\n\nRepublic
    Fleet authorities have refused to comment on the development but Hetman General
    Kanth Filmir is understood to be briefing an emergency session of the Tribal Council
    called by Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor. A Federation Navy spokesman has stated that
    Vice Admiral Foriana Revelli has mobilized reserves and is considering declaring
    a state of emergency in Placid. Counter-insurgency operations are understood to
    be underway and being co-ordinated from the Republic military HQ in Amo system
    and the Federal military facilities in Intaki system.\n\nThe Amarr Empire and
    Caldari State have made no comment on the latest developments but independent
    observers have noted an increase in military activity by both powers. Despite
    allegations of a new Amarr plan to invade the Republic, the Empire's forces have
    continued to focus on the warzone and its borders under the direction of Captain
    Marshal Sirdan xer Qosh. Caldari State forces continue to press on multiple fronts
    while pursuing a multi-pronged foreign policy involving colonial efforts in the
    Syndicate region and increased trade and co-operation with the Minmatar Republic.\n\n![g

    Pirate Fleets Strike Capsuleer Structures Close to Ancient Jovian Stargates Destroying
    Astrahus\n\nAlsavoinon, Placid and G-0Q86, Curse \u2013 Large fleets of pirate
    warships have repeatedly struck at capsuleer structures close to the recently-discovered
    ancient Jovian stargates to Zarzakh, in recent days. The attacks followed [warnings
    from the Angel Cartel and Guristas Pirates](https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/the-scope-pirates-threaten-citadels-scc-clamp-down)
    to remove the structures or face hostile action.\n\nLast night, a combined assault
    by Angel Cartel battleships and a large contingent of capsuleers from the \"WE
    FORM V0LTA\" alliance was able to destroy the \"DECOY\" alliance Astrahus-class
    citadel anchored close to the G-0Q86 stargate to Zarzakh. With significant capsuleer
    forces joining the Angel Cartel in the attack, the valiant defenders were unable
    to stave off the inevitable destruction of the citadel.\n\nIn Alsavoinon, following
    two assaults on its shields on Friday and Sunday, the Guristas Pirates were able
    to reduce the armor belt of the \"Initiative\" alliance Fortizar-class citadel
    anchored close to that system's ancient Jovian stargate. The Fortizar's hull is
    now reinforced until Thursday evening New Eden Standard Time. Significant capsuleer
    defence forces inflicted heavy losses on the Guristas fleet but the pirate group
    appears willing to commit substantial forces to achieve its goal.\n\nThe notable
    hostile interventions against capsuleer structures by assault fleets of the Angel
    Cartel and Guristas Pirates are apparently in line with a join policy of the groups
    combined with the Deathless Circle. The loose pirate alliance appears concerned
    to maintain its control of the Zarzakh stargates and secure deployment routes
    for pirate fleets and capsuleer allies.\n\n![alexander ducass legal team](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/6MFDEA4EkbvHYnN0JHwOhY/66a881b9f96a0eb41fd35db48e495a01/alexander_ducass_legal_team.png)

    offices*\n\n### EverMore Lobbying Against SCC Suspension of Scrip Trading in Money
    Laundering Crackdown\n\nYulai, Genesis \u2013 CONCORD's Secure Commerce Commission
    has pressed ahead with its suspension of scrip transfers in order to combat increased
    money laundering, despite the [announced measures](https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/the-scope-pirates-threaten-citadels-scc-clamp-down)
    continuing to cause turmoil among finance houses and interstellar currency exchanges.\n\nThe
    SCC announcement came amidst reports from security teams of increased criminal
    activity. According to the SCC, this increase has led to unprecedented levels
    of trading in illicit funds via scrips. Scrips are tokens issued by corporations.
    The most common kinds of scrip in New Eden are so-called \"loyalty points\", often
    used by corporates as a form of \"social credit\". The EverMarks currency used
    in capsuleer transactions by the Paragon corporation is also classified as a corporate
    scrip. \n\nAccording to the SCC, criminal groups like the Angel Cartel and Guristas
    Pirates have been using scrips to launder money earned through criminal activities.
    Cartel and Guristas infiltration of the financial systems of New Eden has long
    been a concern with a number of high-profile heists and scrip embezzlement schemes
    in recent years. The commission estimates that trillions of ISK has already been
    hidden from their auditors using scrip trades. \n\nDespite the SCC's insistence
    that this is a temporary measure, the restrictions have been met with criticism
    throughout the financial sector. The President of EverMore, Alexander Ducasse,
    has called the suspension \u201Ca typically anti-business move by an overzealous
    commission.\u201D As Paragon's parent company, EverMore is expected to be negatively
    impacted by the suspension as it eliminates the secondary market for EverMarks.
    In addition to being issued to capsuleers as incentives, EverMarks are also used
    to supplement the salaries of employees in EverMore's subsidiaries. \n\nDucasse
    insists, \u201CI have no fears about the future of EverMore. Thanks to our foundational
    businesses and cutting-edge innovations, I can assure you, that future is secure.
    I am speaking out because entrepreneurial spirit is the lifeblood of this cluster.\u201D
    EverMore's legal team has already lodged a petition for EverMarks to be granted
    an exemption from the suspension in scrip trading.\n\nThe Scope has also been
    informed by sources close to Ducasse that EverMore's significant economic, political,
    and diplomatic resources are being redirected to exert pressure on the SCC. Many
    observers expect that the SCC inclusion of EverMarks will be reconsidered in the
    not-too-distant future."
