- body: "Krusual representatives have been lobbying their counterparts in the Vherokior
    and Brutor tribal houses in an effort to gain a voting majority in the Republic
    Parliament. Long-time rivals of current majority Sebiestor tribe, the Krusual
    are finding support from other tribal houses bolstered by wide-spread dissatisfaction
    with the leadership of current Republic Prime Minister Karin Midular. Should such
    a shift in the Republic majority happen, a new Prime Minister is almost a certainty.
    \n\nThe implicit goal of the Krusual council is just such an ouster, though it
    is unclear if Krusual tribe objectives are simply the replacement of PM Midular
    or a more wide-reaching policy of Krusual control of Parliament. It is clear that
    Krusual tribal leadership sees PM Midular\u2019s tolerant and bargaining stance
    with the Amarr Empire and criminal factions operating inside Republic space as
    counterproductive to Republic aims. \n\nVeshta Preda, a Krusual spokesperson,
    said \u201CWhen she isn\u2019t being passive, she\u2019s being conciliatory. A
    policy of pacifism and accommodation has never served the Minmatar people, especially
    not with millions still enslaved. The Republic requires a leader not afraid of
    direct and appropriate action.\u201D It would seem many in the Brutor and Vherokior
    councils agree with her. \n\nHbild Otu, a member of the Brutor Council and the
    child of slaves, said, \u201CIt\u2019s true that the diplomatic approach has not
    worked, and the Parliament has for too long been Sebiestor controlled. We are
    all Minmatar, with common goals, but such a governing body as the Republic Parliament
    ought to be more truly representative of intertribal Minmatar concerns.\u201D
    When asked about perceived leniency towards criminal factions operating in Minmatar
    space, Otu said, \u201CWe are more concerned with the passivity towards the Amarr.
    The position of the Brutor tribe regarding the Amarr is well known to all members
    of Parliament.\u201D The Brutor have long called for aggressive actions and sanctions
    against the Amarr state. \n\nThe Vherokior council, while not available for direct
    comment, released a statement echoing the general sentiment. It read, in part,
    \u201CGreater representation of the minority tribal councils would be welcomed.\u201D
    Little else is known of the official internal Vherokior position, but most believe
    they can be expected to support any initiative for greater diversity in the Republic
    Parliament. \n\nThere is no doubt where the Krusual stand. Speaking to reporters,
    Krusual spokesperson Preda said, \u201CWhile the personal attacks some elements
    are leveling against Prime Minister Midular are unwarranted and unsupported by
    this council, that sort of talk is indicative of a more general disdain among
    the whole Minmatar people, regardless of tribal affiliation. We need active leadership;
    passive policies toward the Amarr have not manufactured change, and by turning
    a blind eye to criminal activity within the Republic, we lose the support and
    respect of allies in the other empires.\u201D \n\nIf the Krusual are successful
    in their attempts to garner intertribal support for an initiative of this nature,
    calls to replace PM Midular can be expected to crescendo when the next regular
    session of Republic Parliament takes place. With the succeeding Amarr Emperor
    still to be determined, Minmatar Republic Parliament is in recess, ostensibly
    to allow parliamentary representatives time to clear their schedules for an expected
    emergency session on the naming of the next head of the Amarr state."
