- body: "YULAI - Project Discovery, New Eden's capsuleer citizen science organization,
    is to launch its new exoplanets hunting program tomorrow, on the same day that
    its transfer to CONCORD oversight is officially completed. \n\nOperating under
    the guidance of CONCORD's Chief of Deep Space Research, Professor Michel Mayor,
    the new exoplanets hunting program is to offer its highest achievers access to
    CONCORD Aerospace's latest Pacifier frigate and Enforcer cruiser designs as a
    highly-attractive incentive for capsuleer participation.\n\nDefined as planets
    in star systems that have not yet been visited by humanity's exploration missions,
    exoplanets have long been a highly important research target for all the empires.
    With potential colonization efforts now looking beyond the confines of the New
    Eden cluster, the choice of CONCORD to direct the Project Discovery platform towards
    this effort is viewed as highly significant, promising new discoveries in this
    exciting and vital field.\n\nProject Discovery will officially open the new exoplanets
    hunting program tomorrow. The Sisters of EVE have confirmed that all those who
    have remaining Analysis Kredits banked from participation in their highly successful
    tissue analysis program will still be able to use them in their loyalty store."
