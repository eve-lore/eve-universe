    website provides match schedules and results, news reports, match images, ship
    by ship statistics and high definition videos of every match (when they become
    available). There will also be interactive charts, alliance biographies and statistics.
    \ \n  \nPrizes in this year's tournament includes 50 'Adrestia' Heavy Assault
    Cruisers (first place), 'Utu' Assault Frigates (second place), and cash prizes.
    With these rare prizes up for grabs the competition is expected to be fierce.
    \ \n  \n[Last year](http://at.eve-ic.net/8/index.php?view=article&id=2), teams
    threw everything they had into a bid to win the Mimir and Freki Minmatar-based
    modified assault ships. Among the ships fielded, we saw extensive use of Marauders,
    Black Ops, Strategic Cruisers, and Faction ships.  \n  \nPandemic Legion managed
    to come out on top in last year's tournament. Will they once again manage to capture
    the top spot? Come join us at our website and find out.  \n  \n\n\n* * *\n\nAre
