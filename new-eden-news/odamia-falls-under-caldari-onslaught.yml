- body: "**And So It Begins** \\- Only days after CONCORD announced the Emergency
    Militia War Powers Act, the Caldari State have occupied the Gallente Federation
    system of Odamia in Placid. \n\nThe State Protectorate fleet led by Strike Commander
    Daniel Jackson have been operating in the Placid region for approximately one
    week, conducting raids on Federal facilities. The force consisted of approximately
    thirty frigate, destroyer and cruiser class vessels. Jackson was assisted by some
    very capable fleet members including Wing Commander Naisa who managed fleet logistics.
    He is quick to point out that he had other very capable commanders throughout
    this stage of deployment, who kept things running smoothly behind the scenes.
    \n\nWhilst on maneuvers, intelligence arrived indicating the location of a vulnerable
    command and control bunker in the system of Odamia. Upon arrival in the system
    the fleet launched a full assault. \n\nExpecting a high level of resistance it
    is surprising that of the main Federal militia forces, there were only \"two [targets]
    sitting at 300km from [the bunker]\" according to Jackson. Lieutenant Colonel
    Steve Celeste also noted an \"interceptor while [they] were taking the bunker
    into armor.\" However Captain Cyracis did point out that he was \"organizing the
    support wing of battlecruisers and battleships\" so that they would be ready for
    any counterattack on their position. \n\nOdamia was the first system to fall in
    this conflict. It is now time for the Gallente to repond. However for the moment
    Ensign Cyriel Longinus sums up the general attitude of the fleet: \n\n\"Glory
    to the State.\""
