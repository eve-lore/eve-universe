- body: "Yesterday saw the unexpected and illegal publication of a CONCORD memo, detailing
    DED plans to infiltrate the Royal Khanid Navy to find evidence to support their
    claim that a Khanid navyman was responsible for the death of Doriam II, Emperor
    of Amarr.   \n  \nFollowing this outrageous leak, the Royal Khanid Navy held a
    press conference from its headquarters at Kihtaled. Commander Abrikoum Aman of
    Internal Security stated:   \n  \n\u201CThe news of Emperor Doriam II struck the
    Khanid Kingdom as hard as the Empire. The notion that a soldier serving in the
    Royal Navy was responsible for the unfortunate death of Emperor Doriam II is preposterous.
    Until now, no evidence has been provided, nor by CONCORD, nor by the Empire itself,
    at our request. We have exploited our diplomatic channels to either extensively.
    Until now, nothing has been forthcoming\u201D   \n  \nFollowing this statement,
    the Commander went on to say:   \n  \n\u201CNot only do the appointed officials
    refuse to offer comments on this supposed assassin within the ranks of our Navy,
    the memo\u2019s most disturbing passage, that a deep-cover operative is being
    inserted into the Navy, leads us to believe that CONCORD is striving to provide
    the public with a scapegoat, to cover it\u2019s inefficient hunt for Emperor Doriam
    II\u2019s true assassin.   \n  \nWe urge CONCORD to reconsider their plan. This
    does not serve the greater good, this does not serve the balance the institution
    was created to keep.\u201D   \n  \nAlthough CONCORD has yet to respond to this,
    armchair politicians\u2019 columns all over the FTL net are rife with speculations
    following Commander Aman\u2019s veiled insults. Most seem to agree that the accusation
    of regicide is a serious one, and that CONCORD or the Amarr Empire had better
    release a statement soon, lest the Khanid take more aggressive steps to route
    out infiltrators."
