- body: "As recently reported on GalNet, the Serpentis Corporation has announced plans
    to take a controlling interest in the Outer Ring Excavations corporation, a move
    that has surprised the business world and put even the common citizens of the
    Federation on edge. \n\n\u201CI live in a quiet city on a quiet planet,\u201D
    said one woman, \u201Cbut even here you can see those boosters on the street corners.
    It's filthy and wrong, and the idea of those people getting its hands on even
    more poor people is just wrong. The police should do something about them.\" \n\nCONCORD
    and DED have yet to make a statement, and due to their historical reluctance to
    make public statements about the Serpentis Corporation, it is considered unlikely
    that they will pursue action on this matter. Reporters assigned to the DED fleet
    have yet to report any undue activity, and no warrants for the arrest or seizure
    of Serpentis personnel or property have been issued. \n\nThe citizens and contractors
    working for ORE, meanwhile, tell a different story. \"The conditions here are
    awful,\" said one executive, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"They just flew
    their ships into the dock and unloaded a thousand marines on the station. We didn't
    know what to do. Most people fled back to their quarters, while the few who protested
    were gunned down.\" \n\n\"We desperately need help,\" he added. \"I have no idea
    how much longer we can hold out.\" \n\nConditions are even worse at the Mining
    Outpost in 4C-B7X. According to reports leaked through the Serpentis communications
    blackout, close to a thousand ORE personnel have been murdered in the past two
    days. Admiral Brion, the provisional commander of the Serpentis First Expeditionary
    Fleet, denies the claims and says they're rumors designed to stall the negotiations.
    \n\n\"Murder is not the Serpentis way,\" he said in a recent interview. \"We're
    actively involved in negotiations and wouldn't jeapordize our talks with senseless
    violence. Public perception of the Corporation has been very negative in the past,
    and we're trying to change that.\" \n\nStill, reports continue to filter through
    the blackout of widespread destruction, what some have begun referring to as the
    \"Serpent's Massacre.\" Elements of the 3rd Wing and the 22nd Escort Fleet have
    been patrolling the station, looking for fugitive ORE personnel, and Serpentis
    capital ships can be seen patrolling the system. Despite opposition from within
    ORE, it seems likely that the takeover will continue unopposed."
