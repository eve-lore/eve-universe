    the most famous example being the Caldari [ COLOSSUS](http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=439&tid=4)
    race series. Over the last year, however, the pod-pilot organized Interstellar
    Gaming Consortium has institutionalized the practice of pod pilot racing to a
    degree not seen before. Where previous races have either been one shot events
    or short series, the ISGC Racing League is on its [ third season](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=533896)
    complete with corporate sponsorship from pod pilot organizations, of which the
    most famous is Veto. The CEO of ISGC, Gyra Rho, was kind enough to grant the following
    interview to the Interstellar Correspondents: \n\n**Daren Vryennios** Lets start
    with a beginning, shall we? What made you decide to move from the Angels Allure
    initiative to the ISGC? \n\n**Gyra Rho:** A business associate of mine, Kaleigh
    Doyle, was expanding the Glamour Syndicate and was in need of a manager for the
    fledgling sub-corporation at the time, and had asked me to head the racing project.
    She had begun the project and I picked up early and kept it afloat after parting
    from the mega-conglomerate into its own entity.\n\n**Daren Vryennios:** How would
    you characterize the way your first two seasons have gone?\n\n**Gyra Rho:** I
    would say a lot like an avalanche....We had to establish ourselves as a credible
    entity early on with the first season, and build awareness in the stellar community.
    Season two was a culmination of that work, continuously building and evolving
    the races to be bigger and better every time. Every step of the way has been quite
    a surprise for me.\n\n**Daren Vryennios:** Season three seems, so far, to match
    that description. \n\n**Gyra Rho:** Season three started with quite an explosion.
    We've caused quite a ripple this time with some lively participants. Plenty of
    sponsors as well. One of our main corporations to participate in the event, Dragonstar,
    has suddenly deluged into quite a rivalry with newcomers NeuroGEN. \n\n**Daren
    Vryennios** I noticed that the first race was rather violent, is this the result
    of the new presence of NeuroGEN or something else? \n\n**Gyra Rho:** Well, it
    was a combination of events really. Some rather observant pirates made a couple
    waypoints a killing zone for the racers, while NeuroGEN's surgical strikes against
    the League's top racers had left the first race in quite a mess. \n\nThe rules
    have always allowed pilots to shoot one another (no podding), but no team has
    yet to incorporate it in its tactics until now. The pirates are always an unexpected
    variable, but one the racers have come to expect.\n\n**Daren Vryennios:** Do you
    think the violence will continue to increase in the future races?\n\n**Gyra Rho:**
    Inter-corporate fighting I anticipate to rise as participants are made aware of
    just how effective it can be, especially with the addition of interceptors, destroyers,
    and assault frigates to the mix, but the external factors such as belt pirates
    and other pod pilots is usually dependent on the activity of the region at the
    time. Fortunately, Saturdays are usually quite lively for the unsavory types.\n\n**Gyra
    Rho:** It may not be as gruesome, but the audience will sure be clamoring for
    more I am quite sure.\n\n**Daren Vryennios:** So you think that this turn is a
    good thing for your races?\n\n**Gyra Rho:** Well, yes and no. It keeps the veterans
    on their toes, and certainly ups the ante for those who fit for only speed, so
    hopefully this will open some fresh ideas on approaching the league, and viewership
    has never been higher. Newer pilots may be a bit frightened, but the ones we've
    had the pleasure of working with were very enthusiastic...and I always make it
    a habit to warn newer pilots to only fly what they can afford to lose.\n\n**Daren
    Vryennios:** Is the risk of loss the negative?\n\n**Gyra Rho:** The Racing League
    isn't for the faint of heart. Racers should approach the track prepared for anything,
    but for many this is what the allure of racing is all about- risking it all for
    guts, glory, and a great story to tell with your fellow corpmates over a beer.\n\nAnd
    if they're really good, hopefully a ton of ISK for themselves and their corporation.\n\n**Daren
    Vryennios:** Have there been any comments about your decision to expand to crewed
    ships?\n\n**Gyra Rho:** Well, we had a rather high turnout for the frigate classes,
    and only a couple participants for the Destroyers, but honestly I'm not sure a
    crew factored much in that decision.\n\n**Daren Vryennios:** Are you planning
    further expansion of the ship classes in future seasons?\n\n**Gyra Rho:** The
    interceptor class has been by far the most popular class beside the regular frigate,
    but it is still a bit early as to whether assault frigates or destroyers will
    be as popular... We had toyed with the idea of cruisers or even battleships, but
    that would be something to decide at a later date. I'd like to see how the participation
    level goes first.\n\nCloaked ships would add an interesting element, I must admit,
    though amusingly the highest request thus far has been for industrial ships...\n\n**Daren
    Vryennios:** Why do you think that is? \n\n**Gyra Rho:** I'm fairly sure they're
    joking, or suicidal, you really can't tell talking to a podder.\n\n**Daren Vryennios:**
    Well, it has been excellent speaking with you. Do you have anything you would
    like to add?\n\n**Gyra Rho:** We have a race this Saturday [The 30th of June,
    the next race has not yet been scheduled at the time of publication.] in the Placid
    region, and for only 1 mil any pilot is welcome to attend with the appropriately
    classed ship. I look forward to a very entertaining season for our audience.\n\nThe
    ISGC league seems poised to expand even more in the coming seasons, with sponsors
    such as Kendar Zek of the Interstellar Aid Society [providing vessels](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=542502)
    and paying race fees for some prospective contestants. Given the publicity from
    such initiatives, as well as from the brewing militant rivalry between NeuroGEN
    and Dragonstar, the ISGC Racing League looks to be in the midst of an exiting
    third season with potentially much more to come as it moves further into the public
    eye and continues to develop."
