    Speaking from the headquarters of The Sanctuary in a press conference that accompanied
    the release of the paper, Sister Anza Sagera of the Aulari Chapter expanded on
    the report''s findings, saying "while we remain unsure of the exact cause of the
    change in behavior, we are confident that we can accurately predict the new patterns

    represent an elevated threat to any sovereign borders."


    After transmitting a detailed breakdown of the report to the Directive Enforcement
    Department this evening, The Sanctuary also confirmed that Arve Vesren, Director
    of Operations for the DED has called a meeting with the Inner Circle to discuss
    the findings further.


    When approached for comment, Vesren offered only her assurance that "the DED and
    Inner Circle will be studying this report in great detail, before providing our
    recommendations to various law enforcement agencies and navies in the coming days."'
