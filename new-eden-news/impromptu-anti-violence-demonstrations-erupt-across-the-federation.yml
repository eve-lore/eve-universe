- body: "Luminaire - In the wake of widespread ethnic violence inside both the Gallente
    Federation and the Caldari State, thousands of Gallente citizens have taken to
    the street to speak against the carnage. \n\nFederation citizens, both Caldari
    expatriots who have avoided violence and ethnic Gallente and Intaki, have begun
    organizing demonstrations urging a cessation of the violence. Carrying signs and
    shouting slogans, the demonstrators have shown little bias towards condemning
    both sides. \"Love not hate!\" was a popular refrain throughout the day, as demonstrators
    called for the rioters to put down their arms and peacefully return to their homes.
    \n\n\"Neither side is without fault in this,\" said Shana Teahan, one of the demonstrators.
    \"If we continue to hate each other, things will only get worse, more people will
    get hurt, and everything will spiral out of control! People need to calm down
    and not let harsh words turn them against each other. Trying to pass blame will
    not get us anywhere.\" \n\nDespite the demonstrations, violence against Caldari
    in the Federation and Gallente in the State continues to grow worse."
