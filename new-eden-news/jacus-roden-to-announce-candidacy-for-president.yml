    - Jacus Roden, the founder of Roden Shipyards, has officially filed his candidacy
    for the Federation presidency. The news follows an explosive week in Gallente
    politics, during which Roden Shipyards openly defied a national decree, the latest
    in a string of failures that ultimately resulted in President Foiritan's resignation.
    Roden, who ranks amongst the Federations richest individuals, has been retired
    for years, and is the first candidate to file all the requisite paperwork with
    the Federation Administration.\n\nWhile emerging as a folk hero in the face of
    last week's defiant standoff, some senators are already questioning the reclusive
    man's qualifications. Roden's early career was mired in scandal, as he was charged
    by Federal prosecutors with felony counts of theft and racketeering. Although
    the courts eventually dropped charges against him, the damage to his reputation
    remains.\n\nSince handing the corporation to his granddaughter, Roden Shipyards
    has grown into an industrial giant, producing nearly all of the Federal Navy's
    warships. In addition, the corporation has long-standing strategic partnerships
    with Allotek Industries and Duvolle Laboratories. It is rumored that Jacus Roden
    is the man who founded these relationships, but went to great lengths to keep
    his name out of the public spotlight.\n\nAlthough Mr. Roden has filed for candidacy,
    he has yet to make any public appearance or announcement. While not unusual considering
    the reclusiveness of the man himself, filings with the Federal Administration
    are usually followed by the fanfare of a presidential run and the launch of a
    national political campaign. Jacus Roden will have to emerge to address the public
    at some point, as the Gallente public is anxious to learn more about him."
