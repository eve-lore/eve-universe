- body: "Dr Albert Vance and Dr Vic Stats, the two researchers working on a top secret
    project in a Josameto station belonging to the Sukuuvestaa Corporation have once
    again appeared in the Caldari FTL communication channel appealing to pilots to
    assist them in obtaining more electronic parts, again offering above the market
    price for these components.   \n  \nThere has been much controversy and speculation
    surrounding these two scientists over the past few weeks, mainly due to the fact
    they refuse to release the details of exactly what project they are working on.
    The only information we have managed to obtain so far is that it will \u2018help
    unite the EVE universe\u2019 and that \u2018all will be revealed soon\u2019. Although
    this information was enough for a large majority of the pod pilots present in
    the channel to immediately come to the aid of these researchers, many Caldari
    patriots still refused to deal with these scientists, advising other to do the
    same. A recent press release from one such patriot addressed this issue: \u201CI
    ask all of you not to help this couple until they tell us what is going on. Two
    researchers without any background details, from mixed races trying to research
    something in a station owned by Practicals without telling anyone what is going
    on is just too vague. We don't need a full update on their research but I would
    be glad to see what they need help with and why they hide their history.\u201D
    \  \n  \nWith so little information on what experiments these two scientists are
    conducting, whether it is linked to the SuVee Corporation and what effects it
    will have on the universe, it is no surprise that some pilots remain suspicious
    of their intentions. It is obvious that this project will now be watched closely
    by Caldari patriots and curious pilots alike, waiting with baited breath for some
    answers to their many questions."
