- body: '_Jita - A week into Mens Reppola''s tenure as Ishukone CEO, analysts remain
    apprehensive  about his plans for the company, even as its stock trends upward.
    While the appointment appears to have calmed investors'' worst fears and saved
    the company from a devastating crash, Reppola''s plans to focus on high-end research
    and development rather than bread-and-butter heavy industry have caused concern
    that the company could end up spending billions of ISK for potential return that
    may never come._


    _The bigger issue, however, may be the fact that Reppola seems to have placed
    himself  squarely in opposition to State Executor Tibus Heth and the Caldari Providence
    Directorate. "Reppola''s call for ''healthy competition'' seems like a direct
    refutation of the Directorate''s centralized economic plan," said Caldari Funds
    Unlimited senior business analyst Erkkonen Alieto on ___This Is The State__ _.
    "Whether this means they intend to withdraw from the strategic partnership they
    entered into with the Directorate last May isn''t clear. We''ve seen a lot of
    resistance to the Directorate''s initiatives in Hyasyoda, for instance, but they
    remain a party to the CPD nevertheless."_


    _Meanwhile, an analysis of the Reppola buyout that preceded his ascent was released
    by the Caldari Business Tribunal today. In addition to his personal fortune, Reppola
    received financing from Modern Finances, which acted as an intermediary to solicit
    investment from a variety of other sources. According to documents from MF, financing
    for the buyout came from sources as diverse as CAESA bonds, the Federation-based
    Garoun Investment Bank, Khanid-based Samarkand Financial, and a number of individuals,
    including Hyasyoda board member Leevi Warimorri._


    _Perhaps most impressively, the entire buyout seems to have been organized overnight;
    statements from Modern Finances show that Reppola contacted them several hours
    after Natasha Ogemi''s collapse precipitated the stock freefall._'
