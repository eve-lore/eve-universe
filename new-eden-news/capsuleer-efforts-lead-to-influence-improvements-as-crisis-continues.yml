    Capsuleer Efforts Lead to Influence Improvements as Crisis Continues\n\nCapsuleers
    have successfully completed more than 7,000 operations against the Drifters. Thanks
    to this, military forces are ready to deploy more effective intel as a second
    wave of Crisis sites has begun to appear. These superior intel networks are bolstered
    by additional support from the SOCT. \n\nAccording to Elder Mentor Matshi Raish,
    \u201CThe Society will be working alongside Amarr, Caldari, Gallente, and Minmatar
    response teams to purge this threat.\u201D The SOCT has used intel gathered by
    capsuleers to develop superior hyperspace tracking. These improvements will remove
    the negative impact of failed operations and boost the positive influence of successful
    operations.\n\nOf the 7,250 and rising operational successes, the Caldari State
    has shown the greatest number of triumphs against the Drifters so far. Chairman
    Akimaka Saraki commended capsuleers for their support, citing a \u201Ctradition
    of discipline and strong understanding of duty\u201D as the reason for their rapid
    responses.\n\nBy contrast, Minmatar Republic citizens have suffered as their military
    forces were caught off guard. Clan commons have been targeted by Destructive Scrutinizers
    which use intensive radiation to visit a variety of nightmarish conditions on
    those trapped inside. The climbing death toll from these attacks has been a grim
    reminder of the Drifters' destructive capabilities.\n\nIn anticipation of a repeat
    of these tragedies, clans people in the newly targeted systems of Nein, Geffur,
    and Hadozeko have begun to flee. This unplanned exodus has resulted in confusion
    and put more pressure on emergency services. Many more, however, refuse to give
    up their homes. A clan chief based in Hadozeko told the Scope, \u201CFor generations
    we have fought the greedy advances of the damn Imperials, we are not going to
    roll over now and give away our homes to these monsters without a hell of a fight.\u201D
    Hetman General Kanth Filmir, who is responsible for overseeing Tribal Liberation
    Force activities in the system, has called on capsuleers to \u201Caid in the defense
    of our clans, and join the work already being done to push back Drifter forces.\u201D\n\nAnother
    system caught in the second wave of the Drifter Crisis is Tash-Murkon, the home
    system of the Royal House of the same name. This Amarrian system was the birthplace
    of Empress Cariz I herself. In a public statement, the Empress declared, \"We
    Amarr are one in the eyes of the Lord, and there is no system our military service
    people would not die to defend. We must all band together to support every system
    under attack.\" Sources inside the imperial palace have reported that despite
    this statement of equal support, the Empress has begun attending every military
    briefing regarding Tash-Murkon in person. Throughout the Royal Houses concerns
    have been loudly shared over how the Empress will react should her childhood home
    fall victim to continued Drifter attacks.\n\n### News In Brief\n\n- SOCT firmware
    updates promise the possibility of greater retrievals from Observatory Infiltrations\n\n-
    Almost 20,000 Navy service people send joint international messages of thanks
    to capsuleers who saved them following anti-Drifter actions.\n\n- SOCT scientists
    have rejected theories founded on newly gleaned data from Unmoored Observatories,
    calling data \u201Ctoo corrupted\u201D and \u201Cpotentially falsified\u201D.\n\n-
    CONCORD launches investigation into IGC corruption following last year's Guristas
    ATXX sponsorship.\n\n- Capsuleers split over Deathless Circle defense as many
    support criminal research facilities.\n\n- Mindclash tournament in Niballe to
    go ahead as planned despite fears of Drifter attacks on venue."
