- body: "Yulai - Following several days of intense argument behind closed doors, CONCORD
    has finally released information on the new ship design created by Core Complexion
    earlier this week. The ship design, a small frigate with advanced electronic warfare
    capabilities, has been under development by Core Complexion for some time. Utilizing
    advanced computer subroutines, the ships are capable of deploying electronic warfare
    and other non-weaponized anti-ship devices at a higher level than similarly sized
    ships. \n\nUnder Directive Alpha Gamma 12, CONCORD has released the plans for
    the computer subroutines to the other empires to purchase and adapt into their
    own ship designs. The companies that will acquire the plans will be determined
    by a bidding process, with the highest bidder in each empire gaining exclusive
    rights to the technology to be applied how they see fit. It is expected that each
    of the major development firms in the Amarr Empire, Caldari State, and Gallente
    Federation will put in bids on the technology, though there are no obvious favorites
    for the designs at this early stage. \n\nAcquiescing to the pressure from these
    development firms, CONCORD has put a moratorium on production of any ship utilizing
    these designs until such a time as every empire has had time to develop their
    own hulls based off the technology. \"It is the belief of a tribunal held by the
    CONCORD Assembly that Core Complexion had been purposely holding back a working
    prototype so that they would be able to have an early entry into the market. While
    not expressly forbidden by Directive Alpha Gamma 12, we feel that the actions
    of Core Complexion violates the intent of the directive. The company has been
    fined an undisclosed sum for their actions and has been forbidden from manufacturing
    and selling any ships until the other empires have gotten their fair chance to
    catch up.\" \n\nCarthum Conglomerate, among others, has expressed their satisfaction
    with the decision. A Carthum spokesperson said, \"It is reassuring that CONCORD
    still enforces the directive equally with every R&D; company. While we are not
    implying that Core Complexion violated the directive, we were concerned with the
    amount of secrecy involved in the release.\""
