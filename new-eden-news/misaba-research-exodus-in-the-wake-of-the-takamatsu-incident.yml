- body: "Concerned for the security of the Misaba station as well as regarding its
    total research inadequacy, a detachment of local Amarr forces under the command
    of Lord Sorn moved what is assumed to be the rogue navy pilot to a new and more
    secure facility.   \n  \nYesterday evening Lord Sorn recruited pilots with nothing
    but the highest standing towards the Empire for a secret and high security escort
    mission. The pilots, from many corporations including, Imperial Star Guards, Sublime
    LLC, Imperial dreams, Aeternus Crusade, Auctoritan Syndicate, and PIE Inc., executed
    a highly skillful operation to extract the precious cargo from Misaba and protect
    it from many prying eyes and greedy hands.   \n  \nThe taskforce led by Rodj Blake
    encountered no resistance, but with the amount of firepower they were capable
    of bringing to bear on would be assailants this fact easy to appreciate.   \n
    \ \nThis move, which was to be expected given the information leaking from Misaba
    and the stations obvious inability to cope with incidents of this order, had been
    accelerated after the incident of the Takamatsu employee who tried to escape with
    what the Amarr have deemed \"sensitive material\".   \n  \nAll of the escort pilots
    in the convoy were thanked personally by Lord Sorn, calling them all \"a credit
    to the Empire and true examples of faithful servants of the Emperor\". As to be
    expected, all further enquiries into the nature of the cargo have been flatly
    refused by both station and Imperial Navy officials."
