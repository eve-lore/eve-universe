    Kakkichi and his legal representative Dantennen Fisk have been issued gag orders,
    prohibiting them from speaking with members of the press or anyone else outside
    of CONCORD. The order came as a result of an Inner Circle mandate, and is exclusively
    reserved for cases that could expose classified information or pose a security
    risk, internally or otherwise. The security lockdown was issued amidst reports
    of suspicious CONCORD fleet maneuvers close to Empire borders and frenzied activity
    among all department levels within the DED.  \n  \n\u201CIt is interesting to
    note that it is still unknown if Commander Kakkichi has been formally arraigned
    on the charges brought against him,\u201D said Wallekon Kortadaken of the Republic
    Justice Department. \u201CMy suspicion is that he is undergoing some kind of \u2018debriefing\u2019,
    if you will. A gag order implies that a bargain has been struck\u2014perhaps pleading
    guilty to reduced charges in exchange for his full cooperation--which means that
    from this point on, CONCORD will be speaking on his behalf. We may never know
    his side of the story, but time will tell if that holds true or not.\u201D   \n
    \ \nSince the public statement from Counselor Fisk, activity at all levels of
    CONCORD has been significantly elevated, prompting concern from regional government
    officials. \u201CThese developments are extremely disturbing,\u201D said Fanason
    Xalotte of Federation Customs. \u201CI have reports of CONCORD ships patrolling
    border crossings as if they\u2019re waiting for something on the other side to
    come through. It is irresponsible of them to increase their visibility and remain
    silent about their reasons for doing so, regardless of this maverick commander\u2019s
    part in it.\u201D   \n  \nReports from anonymous sources within the DED describe
    a \u201Cpronounced urgency to complete some new mission that has something to
    do with Kakkichi\u201D, but are unable to elaborate due to the security lockdown
    imposed by the Inner Circle. The timetable for the release of information considered
    crucial to understanding exactly what transpired in deep space with Commander
    Tantoseisen Kakkichi and his fleet appears to be contingent upon the completion
    of this mission, the object of which remains a mystery."
