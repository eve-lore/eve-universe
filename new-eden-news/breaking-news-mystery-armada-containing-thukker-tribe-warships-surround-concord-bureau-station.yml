- body: Yulai - *****This is a breaking news story***** Scope News has confirmed that
    CONCORD Bureau Station has been surrounded by a fleet composed entirely of Minmatar-designed
    warships, including at least a dozen Naglfar-class dreadnoughts with Republic
    Fleet markings. More surprisingly, the escorts of these capital ships are reported
    to be Thukker Tribe vessels. However, none of the ships are registered with NEOCOM
    broadcast tags, and all attempts to communicate with the intruders have failed.
    CONCORD and DED warships are locked in a standoff with the armada, but no shots
    have been fired. Reporters from the Scope News network are on scene and will continue
    to provide coverage of these events as they unfold.
