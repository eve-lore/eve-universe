- body: "Otro Garushi, the controversial CEO of the Caldari Ishukone corporation,
    today announced that his company had reached an agreement with representatives
    from the Khanid Kingdom, better known as the Dark Amarr, for Transcranial Microcontrollers,
    a bio-mechanical microchip, that Ishukone recently started full-scale production
    on. The deal is estimated to be worth several trillion ISK and underlines the
    already important trade relations between the Caldari and the Dark Amarr, who
    are considered to be more technically inclined than their brethren in the Amarr
    Empire. Ishukone stands to profit greatly from the deal, thought some people have
    questioned their business practices regarding the microchip.  \n  \nThe controller
    was originally developed by the School of Applied Knowledge with funds from several
    humanitarian organizations to help catatonics regain consciousness and resume
    their lives, though in a limited capacity. It can be used both in humans and machines
    and when it proved to be a great success the Ishukone Corporation stepped in and
    bought the rights to the chip several months ago. Since then, further studies
    by Ishukone technicians have revealed several additional ways the microchip can
    be used as, such as control mechanisms in robots for industrial usage. However,
    experts claim that the microchip does not offer higher efficiency in the robots
    compared to already established methods, which begs the question why the Khanid
    Kingdom is willing to spend such a fortune on the chips."
