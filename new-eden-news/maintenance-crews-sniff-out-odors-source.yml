- body: "VARD - Following weeks of complaints about an odor described as \"increasingly
    putrid\" by local residents and business owners in certain districts of Vard III's
    Six Kin Development Production Plant, today authorities confirmed a maintenance
    crew had located a large fedo colony and the corpses of over a dozen partially-eaten
    people hidden in the bowels of the station.\n\n \n\n\"The stench just seemed to
    come from everywhere,\" said Varn Ofarter, lead on the crew that made the grisly
    discovery. He described how his men hunted unsuccessfully in sewage reprocessing
    lines, storage areas, ventilation ducts, and beneath deck plating while trying
    to find the source of the smell. \"Even the hounds were no help. We were running
    out of ideas of where to look so we decided to open the leg space.\"\n\n \n\n'Leg
    space' refers to station compartments which are built, or left unfinished, solely
    to take the brunt of any damage resulting from exterior assaults or interior incidents.\n\n
    \n\n\"We weren't prepared for what we found,\" Varn added.\n\n \n\nAfter breaking
    through several reinforced panels, the maintenance crew discovered a chamber full
    of fedos feeding on human remains. Medical personnel later counted eighteen distinct
    bodies all in various states of decay and consumption. Additional human remains
    were also present but too degraded to retain any immediately distinguishable features.\n\n
    \n\nPreliminary reports estimate the humans originally numbered at least fifty
    persons, based on the size of the fedo population including the husks of numerous
    deceased creatures. Items and supplies found at the scene suggest the people had
    been living in the compartment for some time already and were prepared to remain
    there for at least several more months despite having no access to fresh water
    or sanitation. The group's cause of death was not immediately apparent to investigators.\n\n
    \n\n\"I'm glad it's over,\" said one station resident. \"I haven't had a decent
    night's rest since the smell came, it was so bad. Put me off food, too. Though
    knowing what they found down there...not sure I'll be hungry for a while again
    yet.\"\n\n \n\nAlthough leg space is generally not monitored and only accessed
    by essential station personnel when needed, Six Kin Development is consulting
    with local architects and security firms in an attempt to determine how so many
    people could have sealed themselves inside the buffer zone unnoticed.\n\n \n\nIdentification
    of the bodies will be delayed while hazmat teams work to clear the compartment
    of biological waste. The human remains will be tested for viable DNA samples to
    cross-reference against missing persons reports filed over the last half-year."
