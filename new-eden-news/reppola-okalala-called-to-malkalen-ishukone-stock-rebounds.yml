- body: '_Malkalen - The Ishukone board has called Ishukone Watch CEO Mens Reppola
    and Minedrill CEO Soisonen Okalala to meet with them at the megacorporation''s
    headquarters, where they have sat in emergency session since yesterday. While
    some analysts believe this may be a precursor to a CEO announcement, many suggest
    this is a sign of desperation as well as an indication the board may be attempting
    to broker some sort of compromise._


    _Meanwhile, a surge of buying at the opening of the markets helped buoy the company''s
    stock price from yesterday''s lows. "The selling yesterday was clearly overzealous,"
    said Inala Oshomi, senior financial advisor at Caldari Funds Unlimited. "These
    are bargain hunters looking to pick up Ishukone stock while it''s undervalued,
    and tomorrow we''ll likely see another decline as people take their money and
    run."_


    _In other Ishukone news, doctors at Zainou Executive Medical Center report that
    118 year old Natasha Ogemi is in serious but stable condition and has regained
    consciousness following her collapse, which was confirmed as a seizure related
    to her Mortensen''s Syndrome. Doctors expect her to make a full recovery, but
    suggest that it could be several weeks before she can resume her normal schedule._'
