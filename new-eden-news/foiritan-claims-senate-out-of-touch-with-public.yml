- body: "In a surprising turnaround President Foiritan has gone from defense on to
    the offense in his struggle with the Senate. Only yesterday he had to fend off
    allegations that he was using taxpayer's money to fund his own hobby interests,
    but now the table has turned with him vehemently attacking the Senate, declaring
    it out of touch with reality and lacking connections with the public.  \n  \nThe
    President's outburst came at a fund-raising gala last evening, where money for
    terminally ill children was being raised. President Foiritan took the opportunity
    to point out that only two senators were attending the gala, a clear sign that
    the Senate did not care for such 'lowly' endeavors, preferring to rub shoulders
    with the upper brass of society.   \n  \nNo Senator has responded yet, but this
    is not the first time that Senators have been accused of being insensitive and
    lacking in their attitude to the less fortunate. This has not the least been apparent
    in their actions in the Senate itself, where bills helping the upper classes or
    promoting the interests of big corporations have repeatedly been past in the last
    year or two. Thus, Foiritan's comments will hit home even harder."
