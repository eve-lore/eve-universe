- body: 'LUMINAIRE - Gerne Broteau was sentenced to twelve consecutive life sentences
    in Caille District Court today, for his rampage at a Minmatar cultural festival
    in Luminaire which killed 59 and left hundreds wounded. Shortly after, the Federation
    announced that it will be extraditing him to the Minmatar Republic to be tried
    in the Sebiestor Tribal Court for his slaying of Karin Midular, the former Sebiestor
    Tribal Chief.


    During the sentencing Broteau remained unemotional as he has throughout much of
    the proceedings, save his brief testimony. After the reading, he was escorted
    out of the court room under guard. Under typical circumstances, it is expected
    Broteau would serve out his sentence in a high-security detention facility, but
    the Federation has announced it will defer punishment to the Minmatar Republic
    in this instance.


    The Minmatar Republic has announced that it will send a Republic Security Services
    fleet in the coming days to receive Broteau. While many expected the Republic
    to move swiftly to take custody of Broteau given their repeated requests for urgency
    in the matter, it is believed the Minmatar have decided to take a more measured
    response given the tensions which arose between the two nations following Midular''s
    death, which led to a Republic Fleet incursion into Federation space and ethnic
    violence against Minmatar in the Federation.'
