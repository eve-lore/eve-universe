    that he would step aside as party leader to allow Maleatu Shakor to enter his
    bid for the premiership in the upcoming elections. In an address to the Republic
    Parliament, Wkumi Pol stated that \"the Minmatar people need a leader who can
    lead us away from the wreckage of democracy and guide us through dangerous times\".
    Mr. Pol further ensured that Mr. Shakor \"has the full support and endorsement
    of the Brutor Tribe\" for the election. \n\nAll Republic parliament heads soon
    followed suit, declaring unity in the cause for Maleatu Shakor\u2019s premiership.
    Sebiestor Party Chief of Staff Nobor Gaban, speaking on behalf of the incumbent
    Karin Midular, stated that his tribe was \"committed to the betterment of the
    Minmatar people\", also adding that no candidate would be submitted to compete
    with Shakor for the premiership. \n\nThe Minmatar Republic, still reeling from
    the events which saw the liberation of millions of slaves in the Amarr Empire
    at the cost of nearly as many lives, is making headway on preparation for the
    elections. While complying lawfully with the democratic process, political analysts
    note that these measures could mark the beginning of a complete transformation
    of the Republic as it is known today."
