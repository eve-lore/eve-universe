    Thukker Mix has claimed that fugitive crime lord Baliggan Krullefor was captured
    by a search party in the Great Wildlands. According to a Thukker Mix spokesman,
    the fugitive was brought to an undisclosed location for holding and that he will
    not be released to Republic custody: \"Krullefor and his Thukker associates will
    not be extradited,\" said Alfrald Enstulf, the spokesperson for the Thukker search
    teams.\n\nReactions have been harsh, with a statement from the Republic Security
    Services calling the action \"unacceptable.\" Achimand Skulada, of the Republic
    Justice Department, derided Thukker Mix, declaring them \"accomplices to murder
    and jailbreak\".\n\nAccording to Enstulf, Thukker Mix identified Krullefor's two
    co-fugitives as members of the Krullefor family's modern front, . All captured
    prisoners of Thukker origins will be held accountable to Thukker tribal law, and
    non-Thukkers will be released to Republic care, Alfrald Enstulf declared in a
    statement.\n\nThe Republic Justice Department has called for an emergency meeting
    this evening; select members of Republic government are expected to attend."
