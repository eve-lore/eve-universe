    - Officials of the Theology Council working in the Ammatar Mandate have released
    details of a formal 'Survey of Faith' carried out in Derelik during the last three
    months, the main finding of which is that the Ammatar Church is being steadily
    supplanted by the orthodox Imperial codification of the Amarr faith. While the
    Ardishapur regime in the Mandate has taken no steps against the Ammatar Church,
    and indeed has expressly re-affirmed it as a valid sect of the Amarrian faith,
    the Imperial rite of faith was declared the official religious doctrine of the
    Mandate by Royal Heir Yonis Ardishapur on receipt of the Mandate as his personal
    fief.\n\nIris Selantar, a former lay preacher of the Ammatar Church now observing
    the Imperial rite, explained her decision to leave the traditional Ammatar sect
    for the orthodox church. \"The invasion taught us many things - the incompetence
    of our nobles, the failures of our fleet and the spiritual poverty of so many
    Ammatar. I believe the destiny of the Ammatar people, and all Minmatar, lies in
    the holy embrace of Amarr and I feel that worshipping with the mother church of
    the Empire brings me closer to Amarr.\"\n\nSubdeacon Ottoko Razirshz of the Theology
    Council mission in the Mandate confirmed that such feelings were typical of those
    Ammatar surveyed by his officials. \"The Ammatar Church is a loyal and faithful
    branch of the great Amarr holy family,\" stated Subdeacon Razirshz. \"However,
    it is clear that observance of the Imperial rite is growing in the Mandate. The
    Theology Council views this as in line with the goal of transforming the Mandate
    into a core domain of the Amarr Empire.\""
