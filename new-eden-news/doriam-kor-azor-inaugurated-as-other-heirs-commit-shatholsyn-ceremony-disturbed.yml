- body: "At an undisclosed location today, Emperor Doriam Kor-Azor was inaugurated
    in what has been described as the most tense moment in modern Amarr history. Doriam's
    first duty was to order the other Amarr heirs to commit Shathol\u2019Syn, or ritual
    suicide. When only Jamyl Sarum remained left to end her life, Sarum fleet warships
    interrupted the ceremony. Combat broke out in what was intended to be a highly
    secure venue as unknown assailants launched missiles at Doriam's ship. It seems,
    as the assailants were working on their own, as Sarum ordered them off and prematurely
    committed suicide before naming the heir to succeed her dynasty. By not naming
    a heir, Jamyl has left her estate ownerless, her fleet and personal militia without
    a leader. After Sarum's death, the ceremony continued as planned with Doriam making
    his first speech as new Emperor of Amarr:  \n  \nFellow Amarrians.   \n  \nGod
    has given me a great duty and I relish the challenges before me. Chords of disharmony
    have been struck in our foreign and domestic dealings these last few weeks and
    my first duty is to find the right tune for us to follow.   \n  \nThrough negotiations
    and goodwill we can bring everlasting peace and prosperity to our own and other
    domains. By focusing on the things we have in common, rather than those that split
    us apart, we can find a common ground acceptable to us all.   \n  \nUnder my guidance
    the Amarr Empire will be great once more and take its rightful place at the head
    of states, as is its divine duty. We will lead by example and the other empires
    will follow.   \n  \nWith us at the helm universal cooperation will ensure that
    everyone reaps the rewards that peace brings. That is my will and that is why
    god chose me as your emperor."
