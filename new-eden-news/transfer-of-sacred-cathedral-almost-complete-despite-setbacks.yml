    flocked to Eclipticum to aid in the transportation of the Tal-Romon Cathedral
    to Amarr Prime. For this massive undertaking, prompted by Emperor Doriam himself,
    to be feasible the help of Amarrian pilots was needed. Hundreds have responded
    to this call and lent their hand to make their emperor\u2019s wishes come true.
    \  \n  \nThe Imperial Chancellery has overseen the operation and according to
    them completion is imminent. This is despite several setbacks where freighters
    have been ambushed en route to Amarr Prime. The Chancellery has brushed these
    instances off as \u2018insignificant\u2019. \u201CThe cathedral is huge and a
    few missing pieces are hardly noticeable,\u201D a spokesperson for the Imperial
    Chancellor stated.   \n  \nYet it is known that hundreds of freighters have been
    attacked in recent days and one must wonder how much more it takes for the re-builders
    of the cathedral to encounter severe problems in resurrecting it. Even if the
    majority of the holy stones that make up the cathedral have made it safely to
    Amarr Prime the loss of some of the sacred relics that are now scheduled to be
    transported would surely be a major blow for the whole operation. Thus, the next
    few days will determine once and for all whether this ambitious undertaking will
    succeed or not.   \n  \nThe instigator of these attacks on convoys is believed
    to be Catiz Tash-Murkon, though she of course strenuously denies this officially.
    Many have questioned the wisdom in so blatantly defying the Amarr Emperor, but
    friction between heirs and a sitting Emperor is far from uncommon. In fact, many
    favorably regard the strong response Catiz has made to imperial encroachment on
    her authority, noting that it is always a strong move for those that have recently
    risen to become heirs to establish themselves as strong and independent in the
    eyes of the world. Even if Catiz Tash-Murkon fails in foiling the emperor\u2019s
    plans she will undoubtedly gain more in respect and admiration from her subjects
    and fellow heirs."
