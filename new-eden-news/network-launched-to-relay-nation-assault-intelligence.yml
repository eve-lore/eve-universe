    **Oruse, Solitude** \\- A corporation named The Roaches have created a communication
    channel for pilots to transmit and gather intelligence regarding Sansha's Nation
    invasions.   \n  \nThe channel, named \"SANSHA RETALIATION\" was launched at the
    start of this week and has since grown in popularity among those who are fighting
    against the Sansha Nation forces.   \n  \nDeathforu, a member of The Roaches,
    explained what the channel meant to him. \"This channel represents some of the
    best corps in [New Eden]. I see a lot of friendships and more future joint ops
    coming from this.\"   \n  \nThe intelligence channel, having only been launched
    this week, has yet to prove itself as a useful source of information, which was
    reflected in one capsuleer's comment, \"I see potential, we're not there yet,
    but there is potential.\"   \n  \nThe \"SANSHA RETALIATION\" channel joins older
    intel channels sych as SYNEPublic and the regional intelligence channels which
    were founded to avoid politically-difficult situations between hostile fleets
    during incursions: Falanx (Gallente Federation), Mikeb Temple (Amarr Empire),
    Heiian College (Caldari State) and RSDI (Minmatar Republic).\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Nation
