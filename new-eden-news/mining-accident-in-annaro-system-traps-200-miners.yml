    asteroid in the Annaro system lost stability and collapsed on a team of nearly
    two hundred miners at a CBD Corporation mining facility. Thirty two miners are
    confirmed dead and the rest remain trapped below the surface. A dozen or more
    are reported to have serious injuries.\n\nEvvlynne Deermin, spokesperson for CBD,
    explained the current situation in a press conference shortly after the accident.
    \"We're holding out a lot of hope for the safe return of our miners. However,
    the situation is difficult. The asteroid is highly unstable, and the crew has
    limited oxygen.\"\n\nDeermin would not comment when asked about the events leading
    up to the accident. One anonymous source near the scene claimed it started with
    a single misplaced explosive, causing a chain reaction of tunnel collapses in
    the hollowed-out asteroid. CBD Corporation is reported to be consulting urgently
    with their partner, Deep Core Mining."
