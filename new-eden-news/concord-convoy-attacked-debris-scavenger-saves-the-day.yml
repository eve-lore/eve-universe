- body: "SINQ LAISON. In yet another convoy attack this week, a CONCORD courier mission
    transporting the corpses of two Guristas terrorists was intercepted at Rancer
    early Sunday. Though Guristas forces managed to destroy the transport vessel,
    the cargo was safely returned to CONCORD by a passer-by loot collector.   \n  \nFreelance
    pilot Horus UK happened to show up in scene after a Guristas \u2013 CONCORD battle
    in the Rancer system left the loot of a destroyed CONCORD Crane floating in space.
    Checking the remains, he was surprised to find out not some modules and starbase
    fuel but the still frozen corpses of the infamous terrorists Mercurion Red and
    Bleak Scarab. Contacting CONCORD forces in the area he returned the cargo to the
    law.   \n  \n\u201CI was both surprised and relieved to no end\u201D, confessed
    convoy leader Commander Plavers. As reported in mid-July, it was Plavers himself
    who captured Bleak Scarab after a failed escape attempt. \u201CWe at CONCORD receive
    endless complaints about debris scavengers and how they should be made illegal;
    yet today one of such kind was the real hero, while trigger happy pilots sided
    with terrorism.\u201D   \n  \n\u201CThe bodies were being carried inside a Crane
    Class transport vessel. One CONCORD Battleship was deemed enough escort\u201D,
    explained Cmdr. Plavers. \u201CWe spotted the Guristas operative Lucash Helmatt
    alone in the system and decided to proceed assuming he was not enough of a threat.
    We were incorrect; Helmatt was able to recruit no less than 7 pilots to come to
    his aid while we received none. They managed to destroy the transport ship, forcing
    me to retreat as my vessel was under heavy focused fire.\u201D   \n  \nAs Guristas
    and ad-hoc terrorists were busy shooting the CONCORD Battleship, the remains of
    the Crane were left without custody; passer-by Horus UK managed to get hold of
    the debris and opening a communications link, offered to hand them to justice.
    The corpses were returned to Cmdr. Plavers at the Caldari Navy station in Perimeter
    where he was forced to dock for repairs.   \n  \nThough not able to comment in
    an official manner on CONCORD\u2019s response to these actions, Cmdr. Plavers
    confirmed having filed the names and corporations of his attackers in order to
    adjust standings accordingly, mentioning his surprise at so many pilots siding
    with outlaws against CONCORD. \u201CWe found strange the presence of PIXE elements,
    since we had heard about their help to a Mordu\u2019s convoy\u2026 yet at the
    next day, they attack a CONCORD transport. Guess you can never be sure with these
    freelance pilots.\u201D   \n  \nThe corpses are still stored at the Perimeter
    station, where they await transport to their final destination which remains classified."
