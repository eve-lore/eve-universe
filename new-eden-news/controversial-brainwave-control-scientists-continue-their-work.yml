- body: "Following their relocation to the Rens solar system last week, scientists
    Dr Albert Vance and Dr Vic Stats resumed their quest for electronic parts on Sunday.
    \  \n  \nThough their requests were met with the usual hostility and wariness
    indicative of previous endeavours to acquire supplies, several capsule pilots
    were eager to assist them.   \n  \nThe three Caldari investigators, led by Pete
    Sance have apparently set up a temporary base of operations at the site of the
    scientists\u2019 former lab in the Josameto system while they continue their inquiries.
    \  \n  \nAfter their unsuccessful raid of the labs last week, the detectives have
    reportedly appeared in the Caldari communications channel asking for information
    on the errant scientists and their research.   \n  \nIt is believed that the detectives
    have spoken to a number of capsuleer pilots, including several individuals with
    first hand information on Vance and Stats and their activities.   \n  \nFollowing
    some initial reluctance to disclose their knowledge, the detectives reportedly
    convinced several witnesses to give evidence against the two scientists as well
    as recruiting a number of informants to monitor future communications."
