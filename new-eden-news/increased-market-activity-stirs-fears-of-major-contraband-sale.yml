    highest, as a large numbers of traders have been heading to the Jita and Nonni
    systems. Amongst these is also Jashira Ne\u2019rgha, CEO of Galactic Trading Logistics,
    who during the past months has visited the systems on several occasions.   \n
    \ \nWhy the Lonetrek region once again has become so popular for traders has led
    to speculations amongst local businessmen. Recollecting previous events, where
    large quantities of contraband have changed hands, indicate business opportunities
    on the shadier sides of the law.   \n  \nSeveral caldari officals have expressed
    their concerns about the current situation pointing out that Jashira Ne\u2019rgha
    has been present every time large scale trades of illegal goods has taken place
    in the above mentioned systems. Although their concerns seem to be reasonable
    and the past has proven them right, CONCORD has refused to increase their presence
    or investigate suspicious pilots.   \n  \nNone of the visiting traders were willing
    to comment on the above mentioned suspicions, although another major trade in
    contraband within the next few days seems imminent."
