    Midular avowed the Republic\u2019s \u201Cdismay at the prevalence of cruelty and
    the passing of an icon.\u201D   \n  \n\u201CThe rising tide of violence and mistrust
    governing the relations of the world\u2019s powers must be stemmed,\u201D read
    the statement. \u201CWhen evil is allowed to exercise its influence unchecked,
    good people, with the potential to do great things, will fall into the valley
    of shadow from whence there is no returning. Acts of cowardice, perpetrated by
    wardens of such evil, are to be condemned now as ever.\u201D   \n  \nThe statement\u2019s
    language has garnered much attention due to its harsh black-and-white nature and
    a certain dramatic flair uncommonly seen in the realm of Matari politics. Says
    analyst Jelani Duchamp, \u201CSomething has quite obviously struck a nerve with
    the Prime Minister. Her political legacy has, to this point, been one of moderation
    and restraint. To be truthful, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a statement
    like this from her.\u201D   \n  \nWhen asked to elaborate on the Prime Minister\u2019s
    statement, Tribal Council representatives present at this morning\u2019s Rens
    III press conference declined to comment, stating that all senior Council and
    Parliament personnel were currently sitting in special session with Urban Management
    and the Republic Fleet, and would take opportunities to comment at a later date.
    \  \n  \nOther questions, such as whether a working Insorum prototype lies in
    the hands of the Republic or anyone associated with it, remain unanswered by the
    Republic\u2019s government. Allegations have on several levels been variously
    dismissed as \u201Cfantastical\u201D or \u201Cabsurd,\u201D but no hard denials
    nor confirmations have been given. Speculation on the matter remains widespread.
    \  \n  \nMore news as it arrives."
