    Amarr and Gallente Diplomats Hail Progress on \"Mutual Astropolitical Understanding\"\n\nPashanai,
    Genesis \u2013 The Amarr Empire's Royal Heir Ersilia Kor-Azor and the Gallente
    Federation's Councillor Wayaki Kayara have issued a joint progress report from
    diplomatic talks between the two major empires at the ACN station in Pashanai
    system. Lady Kor-Azor and Councillor Kayara both expressed \"considerable optimism\"
    as to the progress of the talks and the possibility of achieving \"mutual astropolitical
    understanding\", as the joint communique put it.\n\nTalks between the Empire and
    Federation diplomats have been underway for several days in response to a major
    rapprochement between the Caldari State and Minmatar Republic. Empress Catiz I
    and President Celes Aguard are both said to be keen to come to a swift agreement
    on a new policy of mutual \"non-intervention\" in their respective spheres of
    influence. \n\nIt is widely predicted that the Empire and Federation will cease
    all militia warzone hostilities between their respective forces should the State
    and Republic conclude a treaty of non-aggression, as now seems all but a foregone
    conclusion to most observers. Caldari and Minmatar diplomatic delegations have
    been exchanged in visits to the respective home worlds as the final treaty details
    are negotiated ahead of formal signing ceremonies.\n\n![fn stronghold intaki prime](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/7iG4CwUBwd1sKEORT3RExS/d047635750498fbf232eb628720f3591/fn_stronghold_intaki_prime.png)

    Differ as Federation and Empire Public Absorb News\n\nIntaki, Placid \u2013 Domestic
    critics of President Celes Aguard have been swift to condemn what they see as
    \"a complete abdication of our responsibilities to interstellar civilization beyond
    our borders\", as Senator Suvio Bellaron of Intaki Prime put it during a press
    conference in the city of Lenoika. The Federation public appears somewhat startled
    by the pace of the diplomatic developments, though snap opinion polling indicates
    a guarded welcome for the prospect of improved relations with the Amarr Empire.\n\nPro-Aguard
    Senator Faron Shu, visiting Federation Navy installations in Placid region, responded
    by saying: \"Suvio Bellaron always wants to intervene in somebody else's business.
    No affair is too small or too great: the proceedings of the New Riennes City Council,
    how the Jin-Mei organize Chandeille, the military affairs of the Amarr Empire,
    perhaps even an expedition to the outer regions. But woe betide anyone intervene
    in his precious Intaki system if Suvio Bellaron isn't in a position to take credit
    somehow.\"\n\nIn the Amarr Empire, comment around the Royal Court, and from major
    Holder houses more generally, has been laudatory of the new policy. Military hardliners
    and mercantile houses alike have had many of their recent concerns assuaged by
    the prospect of improved strategic and trade dividends. \"The general feeling
    among the, shall we say, more worldly Amarr nobles seems to be that improved trade
    opportunities with the Federation and the potential to isolate the Republic strategically
    is worth sacrificing a military alliance that many have come to see as less valuable,\"
    said Professor Isidore Colkata of Caille University's Department of Contemporary
    Amarr Studies.\n\n![cn dn anch onnamon](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/6bKmX4L7IEgEyt1H01bsb2/e824db685bbee120ef773e389947b56a/cn_dn_anch_onnamon.png)
