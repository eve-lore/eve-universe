- body: "Yesterday, a group of Amarrians, claiming to be Khanid officials, called
    for a task-force to gather in the Gehi system. The purpose of the taskforce was
    apparently to purify space, removing hostile influences in the Khanid regions.
    The group was led by Jeremia Hurson supposedly of the Ministry of Assessment.
    Gregorman Tasfran was to lead it, supported by Olarania Hunits, Tsuniam Fendrick
    and Finuts Quarte, all of the Ministry of War.   \n  \nHowever, after the taskforce
    launched and ended up in the system A2-V27, one of the pilots, Olarania Hunits,
    fired upon a Blackbird cruiser, belonging to Francis Drakke, a member of the Nemesis
    Corporation.   \n  \nAs the group led by Gregorman Tasfran had Nemesis members
    in their midst, as well as individuals allied to Nemesis, such as Kr0m and DeathRow
    Inc, they considered this a betrayal and proceeded to open fire on the taskforce
    leaders. Olarania Hunits, Tsuniam Fendrick and Finuts Quarte as well as Gregorman
    Tasfran were not prepared to face the onslaught and their ships were destroyed.
    \  \n  \nKr0m official Rift Scorn responded to this by making a public statement,
    which can be found [here](\u201D). Today, we in the Interstellar Correspondents
    were asked to release the following press statement on behalf of Perimum Amyn,
    Minister of War   \n  \n  \n  \n\"I have just heard of several Ministry of War
    officials and an Assessment official of varying rank who called a taskforce to
    meet with them in the Gehi system. Upon investigation I have found that each of
    these pilots undocked from their station in the Agil system and left to mobilise
    the force that would get them through the system A2-V27 and into Querious unharmed.
    \  \n  \nThese pilots have made a grave error of judgement in using the public
    populace in this manner and we are not prepared to let it stand. The Ministry
    of War does not act for or speak in behalf of the Khanid Kingdom.   \n  \nI am
    hereby apologising to the pilot who lost his vessel in the tragedy that happened
    in A2-V27. It was a mistake and it will not happen again. Olarania Hunits was
    not acting under our orders, as such, we are unable to return the value of the
    lost vessel.   \n  \nIt has also come to my attention that these pilots have since
    not been in contact with the Ministry of War. In response, I have removed them
    from the Ministry of War. We cannot tolerate disobedience.   \n  \nIn the near
    future, a representative from the Ministry of War will get into contact with loyal
    Amarrians, through public venues. It is only fitting that these pilots be found
    and executed in a manner that reminds them of their grave mistakes.\"   \n  \nWe
    were unable to contact the Khanid Kingdom directly, although the Ministry of War
    has let us know that they are making amends through diplomatic channels.   \n
    \ \nWhatever happened in A2-V27, it surely isn\u2019t the last we will see of
    these rogue Amarrians."
