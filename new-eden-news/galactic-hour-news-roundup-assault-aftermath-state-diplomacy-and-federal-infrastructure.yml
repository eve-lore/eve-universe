    of Tanoo II_\n\n**Aftermath of Tanoo II Attack Remains Confused as Calls for Restraint
    Collide with Accusations**\n\nYulai, Genesis - CONCORD's Inner Circle has commended
    the Amarr Empire and Minmatar Republic for the \"restraint and spirit of co-operation
    displayed\" in the aftermath of yesterday's dreadnought assault on the capital
    planet of the Ammatar Mandate, Tanoo II. Inner Circle President Seri Okonaya conveyed
    her personal assurance of full support from CONCORD to Captain Marshal Sirdan
    xer Qosh, Imperial Delegate to the Inner Circle.\n\nDelegates Keitan Yun of the
    Republic and Devan Malate of the Federation added their own voices to the call
    for continued restraint, while expressing their \"firm, shared belief that this
    incident was carried out by rogue elements that may even be loyal to powers opposed
    to civilization and human freedom.\" Caldari Substitute Delegate Akimaka Saraki,
    stopping in Yulai enroute to Amarr Prime, responded to the Minmatar and Gallente
    representatives' remarks by emphasizing that \"minds should remain open, both
    as to the truth of this matter, and the validity of the forms of government cultures
    outside the Gallente-Minmatar bloc choose to maintain.\"\n\nThe Amarr Empire's
    higher authorities have continued to maintain a pronounced silence over the affair,
    described by one seasoned observer of Imperial diplomacy as \"a classic mask of
    inscrutability barely concealing extreme rage and a determination to exact vengeance.\"
    The news from Tanoo itself has been limited since the attack was defeated, due
    to a continuing security lockdown and the presence of large numbers of troops
    from the Ardishapur Royal Guards, Ministry of Internal Order and the Order of
    St. Tetrimon.\n\nThe damage to the environs of the planetary capital city of Tor-Ammat
    continues to be reported as \"limited and light\" by the ACN. This is despite
    the evidence from independent orbital overflights that a large new feature, resembling
    an impact crater, has obliterated an outlying peninsula used as a docks by aquacultural
    industries based at the coastal city. One military expert hired by the Scope to
    analyse the images remarked that the damage was \"probably a deflection or guidance
    failure, as it's unlikely the attackers were after the local fishing fleet.\"\n\nEven
    so, the main government, military, industrial, and residential districts of Tor-Ammat
    do appear to have weathered the attack unscathed under the protection of shields
    and counter-ballistic defenses. Given the formidable fortifications of Tor-Ammat,
    and Tanoo II in general, many have wondered at the goals of a small flight of
    dreadnoughts attempting to bombard such a strongpoint. One unconfirmed report
    from a correspondent in the city has claimed that a ground to orbit laser was
    being fired from close to the Order of St. Tetrimon Chapterhouse at the edge of
    the military district. Witnesses of the space battle have also noted that high-power
    targeting lasers were being used by the dreadnoughts, a common feature on vessels
    modified for orbital bombardment operations.\n\nFor their part, the Minmatar Republic,
    Brutor Tribe and Brutor Vanguard have all announced an investigation into the
    individuals identified as the leaders of the attack.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/tanoo_ii_dread_dead.jpeg)

    at Imperial Privy Council**\n\nDam-Torsad, Amarr Prime - The Imperial Chamberlain's
    Office has confirmed that the Caldari State has been invited to send a delegation
    to a \"satellite summit\" to be held in parallel with the meeting of the full
    Imperial Privy Council summoned by Empress Catiz I. While unusual, such summits
    between the Empire and State allies at the Imperial Court are sometimes held to
    discuss matters of critical importance to both polities.\n\nThe Caldari State
    has confirmed that Senior Executive Director Akimaka Saraki of the Wiyrkomi Corporation
    will lead the delegation in his capacity as official substitute for the CEO of
    Wiyrkomi as current Caldari Inner Circle delegate. Executives of the CBD and Sukuuvestaa
    megacorporations are also attending with all three major factions of the \"Big
    8\" thus represented at talks expected to be focused on common defense, infrastructure
    and trade issues.\n\nThe importance the Caldari State's CEP places on these talks
    can be gauged by the determination to press ahead with the summit during the Imperial
    Privy Council despite the continuing and growing protests by workers and middle-tier
    executives across the corporate territories of the ruling Big 8 megacorps.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/trace_cosmos_duvolle_gererique.png)

    Gererique_\n\n**President Celes Aguard Announces Major Federal Infrastructure
    and Redevelopment Program**\n\nGallente Prime, Luminaire - President Celes Aguard
    has delivered remarks announcing a \"major new federal infrastructure and redevelopment
    program focused on the periphery of our great Federation\", during a holocast
    open meeting between the President and the Senate Federal Works Committee. President
    Aguard ran for office on a program that emphasized the need for the Federation
    to invest in the security and infrastructure of the periphery systems and appears
    determined to make good on her campaign promises.\n\nPresident Aguard confirmed
    that she recently authorized the Federation Navy's Stellar Survey Corps to carry
    out new surveys in the Solitude, Placid and Verge Vendor regions with a view to
    determining the best locations for a mooted direct stargate connection between
    Solitude and the other regions of the Gallente Federation. At present, stargate
    traffic must take a dangerous route through the Syndicate region or a longer and
    barely safer route through Genesis and Aridia. The President made the construction
    of a new stargate to Solitude a campaign promise emblematic of her commitment
    to the periphery of the Federation.\n\nThe President also pointed to federal support
    for the newly-established Duvolle Gravitational Wave Observatory studying the
    \"Trace Cosmos\" phenomenon in the Gererique system in Solitude. Additionally,
    President Aguard confirmed that federal funds would be made available for the
    next phase of the long-term project to restore or \"remedially terraform\" Mannar
    VIII. The original home world of the Mannar people, the planet was rendered barren
    and the surface uninhabitable after an ecological disaster nearly 150 years ago.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/audesder_alliance_barracks.png)
    \ \n_Above: Minmatar Alliance Barracks in Audesder system_\n\n**DEVELOPING: Minmatar
    Republic 's Audesder System \"Raided\" by Ardishapur Mercenaries**\n\nAudesder,
    Molden Heath - Several squadrons of Red and Silver Hand combat vessels have been
    reported carrying out \"raids\" in the system of Audesder on the border of the
    Minmatar Republic with the Ammatar Mandate. The Red and Silver Hand are a mercenary
    company known to be sponsored by the Ardishapur family, the ruling house of the
    Derelik region.\n\nAudesder is a heavily-fortified system that serves as the headquarters
    of the Minmatar Alliance Defense Brigade, a combined force comprising elements
    of the Republic Fleet and allied Federation Navy forces. This alliance defense
    nexus commands the route to the Kenobanala system, itself a heavily-fortified
    base and location of the notorious Fort Kumar, headquarters of the allied forces
    of the Imperial Navy, Caldari Navy, Ammatar Fleet and Royal Khanid Navy.\n\nThe
    two alliance garrisons have maintained an uneasy peace on the Republic-Mandate
    border for decades, with relations even easing in recent years as diplomacy and
    trade prevailed on the Derelik-Molden Heath routes. The reported new incursion
    on this fragile border, even by mercenaries, comes at the worst possible time
    as tensions are at breaking point over the Tanoo II attack. There has been no
    comment from the Republic, Mandate or Empire so far.\n\n**In Other News**\n\n
