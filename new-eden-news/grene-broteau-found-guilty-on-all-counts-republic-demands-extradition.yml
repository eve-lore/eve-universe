- body: "_Luminaire_ _ - _Grene Broteau, the mass-shooter who killed 59 [Minmatar](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Minmatar)
    and injured hundreds during a rampage in April, was today found guilty in [Caille](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caille)
    District Court of 59 counts of first degree murder, 362 counts of assault with
    a deadly weapon, and 12 counts of mayhem with the intent to incite terror, along
    with numerous other charges. \n\nBroteau appeared in court wearing a prison jumpsuit
    and restraints and was silent throughout the reading of the verdict. At one point,
    cameras captured him smiling, though for the majority of the reading he remained
    stoic. After hearing the verdict, the judge ordered a sentencing hearing for the
    1st of June.\n\nThe trial of Broteau, which began on the 13th, was considered
    a relatively uncomplicated affair considering the high profile of the attack.
    Media coverage through the trial was heavy, but remained respectful. The two [Sebiestor
    Tribe](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sebiestor Tribe) monitors remained mostly
    in the background throughout. Because of the nature of the attack, the trial proceeded
    relatively quickly.\n\nSome controversy erupted when Broteau took the stand and
    subsequently refused to answer any questions presented to him, instead using the
    opportunity to rant about Minmatar immigrants and profess his admiration for the
    [Black Eagles](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Black Eagles) and their director,
    [Mentas Blaque](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Mentas Blaque). As Broteau was
    testifying in his own defense at the time, he was dismissed from the stand after
    the prosecution declined to cross-exam.\n\nShortly after the verdict was made
    public, the Tribal Assembly released a statement criticizing the speed of the
    [Federation's](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente) justice system and
    requesting immediate extradition of Broteau to face charges in the Republic for
    the death of [Karin Midular](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Karin Midular)
    and several other Republic residents attending the festival.\n\nThe statement
    called the month-long wait between Broteau's arrest and a reveal of information
    about him a \"disrespectful period of silence\" that \"led to wild speculation,
    rash acts, and needless violence between our two nations.\" It went on to say,
    \"The murderer of the Ray of Matar must stand trial before Tribal justice. It
    is the only just resolution.\"\n\nBroteau's counsel have said there are no plans
    to appeal."
