    has formally suspended the Presidential Election following multiple [terrorist
    attacks](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/federation-under-election-eve-comms-network-attack-as-terrorists-target-presidential-candidates/)
    on presidential candidates and federal communications networks. The suspension
    also applies to all other federal elections scheduled to be held over the 28th
    and 29th of February.\n\nWhile the Friday and Saturday elections would have been
    dominated by the Gallente Presidential Election, they also included the fifth
    of the Federal Senate seats up for election in this year's cycle. The suspension
    is until further notice. The Federal Elections Commission has not considered a
    rescheduled date for the elections, as the situation in the Gallente Federation
    continues to develop.\n\nPresident Jacus Roden has broadcast a brief message to
    the Federation assuring all citizens that: \"The security of the Federation and
    its citizens, the continuity of democratic government, and a peaceful transfer
    of power to the next duly-elected President of the Gallente Federation are the
    first and last priorities of my administration.\"\n\nPresident Roden is personally
    co-ordinating the Federal Administration's response to the attacks and crisis
    through the Federal Security Council and Federal Military Commission. A full broadcast
    to the Federation will be made when sufficient bandwidth is available.\n\nCommunications
    disruptions are ongoing across the Gallente Federation's networks with some service
    slowly resuming as Federal and CONCORD agencies organize countermeasures, secure
    routers, and establish provisional relays. Federal networks remain congested and
    intermittently subject to collapse due to ongoing information warfare network
    agent intrusions, attacks on physical infrastructure and elevated communications
    traffic due to the emergency.\n\n**BREAKING NEWS**\n\n  * Celes Aguard Survives
