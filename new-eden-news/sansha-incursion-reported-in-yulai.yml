    Genesis** \\- Earlier today a massive Sansha fleet under the direct leadership
    of Master Kuvakei invaded the Yulai solar system. The fleet included several super-capital
    vessels.  \n  \nThe incursion began at about 21.00 and early reports indicated
    that at least 1700 capsuleers rallied to the solar system in a bid to repel the
    attack.  \n  \n[![Sansha Vessel Under Attack](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4358/sanshavesselattackthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4358/sanshavesselattack.png)A
    wormhole was initially spotted in close proximity of Yulai's sun triggering the
    response from the bulk of the defending fleet. Only a few minutes later, wormholes
    were reported above the second, the fifth, and the eleventh planet, extending
    the fight throughout the system.  \n  \nDuring the initial moments of the attack,
    Master Kuvakei addressed the pilots listening to Yulai's local channel: \"I will
    give you all a moment to reflect upon the weakness of your separate minds...I
    hope your fleet is better prepared than your voices.\"  \n  \nDespite the efforts
    of the defending capsuleers, who managed to destroy at least three super-capital
    vessels, Sansha forces succesfully harvested plasma and core samples from the
    sun itself before opening what Kuvakei defined as a \"conduit\" to the Promised
    Land solar system, where the fleet was later reported by capsuleer Horatius Caul
    and later engaged by local pilots led by Rodj Blake of PIE.  \n  \nClashes in
    Promised Land were less impressive than the ones in Yulai, mainly because of the
    smaller number of capsuleers that managed to reach the low security system: \"We
    were unsuccessful due to a lack of pilots who were willing to risk their ships
    in low-sec space,\" explained Rodj Blake.  \n  \nAt the time of writing, the Sansha
    incursion is still underway but seems to be winding down. Interstellar Correspondents
    will continue monitoring the situation.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events
