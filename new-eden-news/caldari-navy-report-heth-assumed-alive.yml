- body: '_Haatomo - _The [Caldari Navy](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari
    Navy) has completed its full sweep of the [Caldari Constructions Warehouse](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari
    Constructions) station in Haatomo and has found no indication [Tibus Heth](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tibus
    Heth) is hiding onboard. Security footage recovered from cameras show Heth boarding
    one of the ships that was confirmed to have escaped the blockade on June 18th.


    However, it appears that Heth was injured during the storming of the station by
    Caldari Navy and corporate security forces, as blood matching his DNA has been
    found at the docking ring. Officials are uncertain as to the extent of Heth''s
    injuries, but believe it likely he has survived them.


    The last known location of the escaped ships was Kedama, leading officials to
    believe Heth is hiding somewhere in the largely unpopulated and isolated communities
    of [Black Rise](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Black Rise). A large scale manhunt
    has already begun, though officials say Heth may potentially attempt to alter
    his appearance and be given shelter by supporters throughout the State. Despite
    his plummeting in popularity over the past several months due to a number of draconian
    measures that curbed both corporate and worker rights, as well as several other
    actions that angered the populace, a small minority of Caldari are believed to
    still be fervent in their support of the disgraced former State Executor.'
