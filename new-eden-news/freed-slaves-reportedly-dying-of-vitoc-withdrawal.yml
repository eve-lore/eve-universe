    Kor-Azor are reportedly \u201Chundreds\u201D of those infected with various viral
    control agents. Originally designed as a method to enforce compliance in Minmatar
    slaves, these viral control agents kill their victims unless a constant supply
    of the antidote drug Vitoc is administered. Minmatar and neutral organizations
    are receiving reports of freed slaves dying in transit or while waiting for transfer
    to ships that would carry them to freedom. \n\nWhether an oversight, a tragic
    accident, or (as many Minmatar are saying) a calculated and merciless act of murder,
    if these reports can be substantiated they will no doubt further sour relationships
    between the Minmatar Republic and the Amarr Empire. \n\nIntoxication with the
    viral control agents themselves have little or no obvious immediate effect, provided
    the antidote Vitoc is available and administered on a regular basis. Further complicating
    matters are the various strains or classifications of Vitoc necessary to counter
    the effects of the viral control agents. \n\nGiils Delaau, a Gallentean biochemist
    working with the neutral organization the Sisters of Eve, has studied the so-called
    Vitoc Method and its associated chemical agents for over a decade, and is one
    of the leading experts into this controversial and vilified practice. \n\n\u201CThe
    viral agents the Amarr use are mutable in ways that we are still struggling to
    understand,\u201D said Delaau. \u201CThe various types of so-called \u2018viral
    drug\u2019 we have managed to isolate and study are chimerical\u2014that is, they
    have apparently recombinant characteristics of various viral types in a single
    strain\u2014and appear to be somehow random or programmably mutable, changing
    in ways that we can\u2019t anticipate or predict. We\u2019ve been able to isolate
    thirteen or fourteen different envelope proteins, which allow the viral agents
    to deliver their \u2018payload\u2019 if unchecked, but in every instance the payload
    itself and the replicative machinery\u2014the internal mechanism that allows the
    virus to spread throughout the host\u2014has been from different or unknown strains.\u201D
    \n\nThis unpredictability is what makes the so-called Vitoc Method so reliable:
    for the past dozen years, it has been impossible for Minmatar or Gallente scientists
    to devise an alternative antidote to the viral control agents. \u201CIt\u2019s
    literally like trying to crack four or five codes at once,\u201D Delauu said.
    \u201CIn order to succeed, you\u2019d have to solve each code simultaneously,
    over and over again. We don\u2019t know who engineered these viral agents, or
    really even if there are different strains, or if all the mutations we see are
    simply variations on the main virus. And we can\u2019t manufacture an antidote.\u201D
    \n\nBut the Amarr can, and do, in ways that baffle those studying the problem
    from outside the Amarr Empire. Delauu, again: \u201CSomehow they control the virus
    or know what it\u2019s going to do, and can blend a type of Vitoc that prevents
    the viral control agent from killing its host. Without that Vitoc \u2026 well,
    I\u2019ve only seen one heroic test subject die from Vitoc withdrawal, and it
    still haunts me. It is not a pretty sight.\u201D Reports from border regions where
    the freed Minmatar are in transit or are being held for transfer are indeed horrific,
    if true. Stories of incredibly agonizing and grotesque deaths are making the rounds,
    but as yet no hard proof has materialized. \n\nSources inside the Amarr Empire
    are difficult to reach, owing to the great changes going on throughout Amarr Sovereign
    space, but Ammatar officials have responded, and are dismissing the reports as
    \u201Calarmist propaganda intended to undermine the beneficent and noble gesture
    of Doriam Kor-Azor toward the Minmatar people.\u201D One report from a confidential
    source suggests a subversion of Kor-Azor\u2019s attempt to free Minmatar citizens
    by \u201Ccertain agents displeased with the imminent succession.\u201D It can
    only be assumed these \u201Ccertain agents\u201D would be under the direction
    of Jamyl Sarum, already widely believed to have ordered the attack on slave transport
    convoys in Roushzar that killed scores of Minmatar youths destined for freedom.
    \n\n\u201CIf the reports are true,\u201D said Delauu. \u201CIt\u2019s a horrible
    thing to contemplate. If it was an error or oversight, it\u2019s a tragic and
    terrible case of negligence. If intentional, it\u2019s almost unthinkably, unnaturally
    cruel. I cannot conceive of anyone willfully inflicting this sort of death on
    another living creature,\u201D he said, but continued after a thoughtful pause,
    \u201C\u2026 but then the Amarr invented this as a method of control in the first
    place, and intended for it to strike terror in its victims. Which is worse?\u201D"
