    Fleet Op Leads to All Out Brawl in Drifter Infested Tabbetzur\n\nRepublic Fleet,
    Deathless Circle, Drifter forces, and capsuleers have fought over valuable Warden
    Connection Harmonics inside Tabbetzur. Codenamed \u201COperation Harmony Breach\u201D
    by the Republic Fleet, they barely managed to claim victory after their second
    strike.\n\nThe operation took place after the Drifter\u2019s hyperspace manipulation
    of the system. The brute force of this attack disabled stargates into and out
    of Tabbetzur, surrounding them with unstable radiation. Research teams have as
    of yet been unable to examine the gates in detail.\n\nShortly after Republic engineers
    brought gates back online, Republic Fleet Valravn and their support covertly entered
    the system. Their targets were Deathless structures called Warden Relay-Chainers.
    As the Republic fought with capsuleers, the Chainers were destroyed, revealing
    the Warden Connection Harmonics. The conflict escalated as Deathless Circle ships
    and the Drifters themselves arrived. No Republic or Deathless ships managed to
    survive this first strike. \n\nFor a full report on the first Tabbetzur strike,
    watch a recording of the Scopes live coverage [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2398731297).\n\nThe
    following morning at 09:00 a second strike took place. This time a Republic Valravn
    and a Vargur survived thanks to the help of capsuleers. Their captains, Lerato
    Eir and Beulah Laras, thanked those who had helped turn this operation around
    against impossible odds.\n\n![Tabbetzur Gate](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/6KVC5DqCMoxsdQ4UsPVVB0/f3be45a7337169a1ec87bc9ad07fc7ce/tabby_gate.png)\n\n###
    Harmonics Boost Competition Over Drifter Wormholes\n\nInterested parties throughout
    the cluster have begun reaching out for the newly available Harmonics. The items'
    only function is to provide remote access to the Warden. This Warden access is
    believed to be a significant advantage in the race for a sustainable foothold
    in Drifter wormholes. As the Deathless Circle has ceased deploying these structures,
    those discovered so far may be the only copies in existence.\n\n__ATTENTION:__
    The Scope has consulted with experts and they believe that __only items received
    by the end of YC127.03.16 will be of use__ to the interested parties. After that
    point, the Deathless Circle will have been able to reroute their remote connections
    and the Harmonics will be of no value. \n\nThe factions seeking the Harmonics
    are as follows:\n\n- Amarr Empire via the Ministry of Internal Order.\n- Angel
    Cartel via Salvation Angels, Guardian Angels\n- Caldari State via the CEP and
    House of Records.\n- EDENCOM via the DED.\n- EverMore via Paragon.\n- Gallente
    via the Federal Intelligence Office.\n- Minmatar Republic via the Republic Security
    Services.\n- Society of Conscious Thought via the SOCT and Genolution.\n- Triglavian
    Collective via the Collective itself, Perun Clade, Svarog Clade, and Veles Clade.\n-
    The Upwell Consortium via Ytiri.\n\nIt is clear that there will soon be active
    competition over the Drifter wormholes. With ten interested parties and only five
    Drifter wormholes, not all these groups will be successful. In addition to these
    harmonics, we can expect ongoing requests for support from these factions as they
    fight for control of this new frontier.\n\n### News in Brief\n\n- Sanmater Shakor
    holds two-minute silence for people of Tabbetzur.\n\n- President Aguard offers
    condolences to people of Tabbetzur following Drifter attack.\n\n- Clans of Tabbetzur
    practice anti-Drifter tactics as many vow not to give up fight.\n\n- Suspect Angel
    Cartel operatives found dead before trial over Drifter tech smuggling begins.\n\n-
    Republic Fleet Captain Einar Eliakin called to military tribunal following questions
    over conduct during Operation Harmony Breach.\n\n- Chairman Akimaka Saraki praises
    resilience of Tabbetzur people against Drifter threat.\n\n- Outdated firmware
    on CONCORD alert system blamed for false Invasion warnings following Drifter attack
    on Tabbetzur.\n\n- Tabbetzur poem by Kam\xED D\xEDa, Ashes of Turnur leader, condemned
    as tasteless by Republic government."
