- body: 'RENYN - The Federal Intelligence office has confirmed rumors circulating
    in the press that the Special Department of Internal Investigations and Federal
    Security, also known as the "Black Eagles", is in the midst of an investigation
    that may link the outbreak of Kyonoke Plague in Postouvin to acts of terrorism
    in the Federation.


    During a statement made to the interstellar press on board FIO Headquarters in
    Renyn, Thoun Gaterau, Lead Field Agent & Administrator for the Black Eagles, commented
    that "an investigation is ongoing into the origins of the Kyonoke outbreak In
    Postouvin, and has been launched to ascertain whether an extremist Caldari Nationalist
    attack is responsible for the current situation on board the RP4 hemorphite processing
    platform."


    When questioned regarding the nature of the investigation, Gaterau elaborated
    his belief that "Kyonoke originates on the Caldari side of the border, and until
    two weeks ago it was a Caldari problem. It does not strike me that the Caldari
    administration would want to share this problem with the wider cluster given the
    pathogen''s voracious nature, and the certainty of death for anyone who comes
    into contact with it.


    "My personal belief, after exploring the evidence so far with my colleagues, is
    that an as of yet unknown quantity is involved, and has launched a deliberate
    attack against the Federation and our allies."


    Gaterau deflected further questions regarding the status of those still trapped
    on board the RP4 mining facility, referring questions to the Senate''s Office
    of Press.'
