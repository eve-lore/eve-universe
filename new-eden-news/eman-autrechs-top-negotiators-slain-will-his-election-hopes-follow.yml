- body: "Eman Autrech, chief of the SCC and candidate in the forthcoming Gallente
    elections was shocked to learn that one of his diplomacy missions had gone fatally
    wrong.   \n  \nIn the hope of swinging more votes and creating trade deals, Mr
    Autrech sent 10 of his highest and most trusted negotiators to meet with the Intaki
    Syndicate, this week. He hoped to not only gain fiscal benefits from this mission,
    but also to penetrate the Intaki vote to aid him in his cause.   \n  \nThe Syndicate
    invited the negotiators to meet in the Intaki solar system. Unfortunately however,
    the Intaki home system is in a low security region of space which allowed those
    opposed to the negotiations a chance to strike at the convoy.   \n  \nAlthough
    the trip for the 10 man team was classified top-secret the convoy containing the
    VIP\u2019s was attacked by unknown pilots, who apparently gained intelligence
    on Autrechs\u2019 intentions. They managed to stave off the attack but were forced
    to recruit mercenaries in the local space lanes and through the Gallente Galnet
    channels.   \n  \nWhen enough pilots had signed up the convoy continued on the
    6 jumps towards Intaki. However, the very public nature of the mercenary hiring
    had attracted attention from pilots who were more interested in stealing the cargo.
    However, under the watchful gaze of the sentry guns surrounding the stargates,
    they could do little but watch and intimidate the convoy though the local channels
    \  \n  \nA single starjump away from Intaki, in the solar system Vey, it seemed
    as if the mission would be a success. At the stargate, three ships, one Megathron
    and two Thoraxes, spotted the convoy and immediately opened fire, ripping through
    the Dominix class ship containing the VIP\u2019s as if its hull was made of paper.
    \  \n  \nDuring evacuation of the ship, the escape capsules containing the VIP\u2019s
    were breached; causing it to depressurize and all 10 negotiators were lost. The
    mercenaries were unable to stop the attacking forces in time, suffering minor
    casualties in the process.   \n  \nAlthough Eman Autrech was not available for
    comment, he has sent formal letters of condolences to the families of the victims
    personally. He was very close to some of the negotiators lost in Syndicate.   \n
    \ \nPolitical analysts say the event could be damning towards his campaign. Corporations
    could be frightened off for fear of reprisals from this unknown group, and with
    Autrechs most senior and skilled negotiators lost; he would find it hard to make
    his views heard in future debates."
