- body: "Caldari Prime - Since the cease fire order has been issued hostilities are
    coming to an end on Caldari Prime. A few shots can be heard at a distance but
    as this is reported even they are being silenced as the order from President Foiritan
    is spreading. With the Gallente troops laying down arms, Tibus Heth's soldiers
    are securing their objectives, setting up fortifications and rounding up prisoners.
    \n\nThe major cities of Caldari Prime resemble huge battlefields, filled with
    bodies of overwhelmingly Gallente ethnicity. Preliminary numbers are projecting
    hundreds of thousands of soldiers dead in the first five minutes of fighting as
    the Caldari State deployed the majority of their MTAC and Heavy Infantry reserves
    onto the planet's surface. Reports from both sides indicate that the Gallente
    forces fought bravely and stubbornly, but were completely overrun by the Caldari
    onslaught and were cut down like dead grass. Projections are also estimating \"at
    least tens of thousands\" of Gallente civilians caught in the cross-fire as the
    Gallente military responded to the attack. \n\nThe fighting might have only lasted
    a few hours, but it will be days if not weeks before every body is accounted for."
