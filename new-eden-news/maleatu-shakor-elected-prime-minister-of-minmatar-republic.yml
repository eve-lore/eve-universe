- body: "The final ballots have been counted in the Minmatar Republic elections, with
    lone candidate Maleatu Shakor winning by default.   \n  \nAt his inaugural speech
    this afternoon, Prime Minister Shakor said:   \n  \n\"Sons and daughters of Matar,
    make no mistake about it. Now is a moment that tomorrow's people will look back
    on for inspiration. Now is a moment where we do what should have been done long
    ago. The tone of the future will be set by our actions today. We will submit no
    more, to neither despot nor nation. Let it be known from this day forth that we
    are a race of warriors, not slaves, and that we will fight to the last drop of
    blood for what we hold dear.\"   \n  \nShakor also stressed the importance of
    clan unity. Flanked by the Chiefs of the Minmatar tribes as he spoke, he made
    repeated mention of the tribes' diverse cultures and capabilities coming together
    under the umbrella of a unified Minmatar nation. He finished his speech to thunderous
    applause and a standing ovation from the thousands in attendance.   \n  \nThe
    reasons for the voter turnout - the lowest recorded in the Republic in thirty
    years - are widely disputed. Some sources claim it is due to a grassroots movement
    of democracy advocates who disapprove of Shakor's methods in coming to power,
    but others dismiss such notions, explaining the numbers by saying that in a one-candidate
    race there is simply little incentive to vote.   \n  \nRegardless of the turnout
    and what it may mean, social elements within the Republic appear to widely favor
    Shakor. Several of the largest organizations and special interests groups in the
    nation have been quick to declare their support of him.   \n  \nMaleatu Shakor,
    62, steps up as Prime Minister of the Minmatar Republic after nine years of service
    as the head of the Republic Parliament. Prior to that, he spent fourteen years
    serving various administrative posts within the Parliament, the Republic Justice
    Department and the Brutor Tribe. In his younger years Shakor was a revolutionary
    of some note, rumored to have been responsible for a number of coups against regional
    holders in several areas of Ammatar space. He is unmarried and has no children."
