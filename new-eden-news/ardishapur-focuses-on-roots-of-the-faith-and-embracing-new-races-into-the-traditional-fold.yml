    - The first of Yonis Ardishapur's speaking engagements was held today in Dam-Torsad
    on Amarr Prime. Speaking before a crowd of just under a thousand for little over
    an hour, the heir has focused mainly on his views on religion, the Empire, and
    the roles of all peoples in its future.\n\nArdishapur called on all those attending
    the event to \"remember where you came from. Be you a freed slave, a descendant
    of slaves, a merchant, a Navy officer, a Holder, or even royalty, it is paramount
    to remember the roots of the faith. All men are created to serve God and do His
    will. It is not merely time served that shall be rewarded, but the conviction
    and faith with which you serve.\"\n\nAdditionally, Ardishapur made clear his views
    on the other races of the cluster. \"All people must one day be brought into God's
    embrace, through their own choice or through our guiding hand. Embrace those who
    would learn, defeat those who would make mockery of God's way. Through the penance
    of deeds, the sins of forefathers may eventually be washed away. This is the Amarr
    way and it is the future, if the Empire is to thrive.\"\n\nThe heir closed his
    speech thanking those for attending and promising that he would \"never forget
    the sacrifices made by the true faithful in times of falsehood.\""
