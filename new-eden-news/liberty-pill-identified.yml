    LUMINAIRE - Gallente Customs officials have solved part of the mystery surrounding
    the ''Liberty'' pills seized last week in the Weraroix system. The nanobots each
    pill contained appear to have been designed to make their way to strategic parts
    of the body, including the lungs, where they instigate general hypoxia and eventually
    lead the subject to quietly expire from oxygen deprivation.


    The Sisters Of Eve have since confirmed the ''Liberty'' pill to be behind the
    mass suicide at Gererique. "We found a similar package containing some extra pills,
    and autopsies then revealed all the people died in the same manner. We are now
    relatively certain of the how, we just still don''t understand the why," said
    SSOE agent Lenz Kaaloaka.


    Gallente Health and Safety officials have called for anyone with any knowledge
    of the pill or its manufacturers to come forward.'
