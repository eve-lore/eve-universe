    Following a special hearing of representatives from the Sukuuvestaa Corporation
    and Lai Dai, the Caldari Business Tribunal announced today that both corporations
    will be facing sanctions for \"unlawful anti-competitive measures.\" The sanctions
    come as a response to the past months' series of security breaches and attacks
    upon assets of both corporations. The CBT deemed these actions to be the deeds
    of agents working for Lai Dai and the Sukuuvestaa engaging in covert strikes against
    the other corporation.\n\n\"This type of behavior is completely unacceptable in
    a society as civilized as the State,\" says Samon Mitsimo,  head of the CBT..
    \"We cannot have the corporations at each others' throats in a time of war.\"
    \n\nThe details of the sanctions and reparations remains to be decided. The CBT
    is expected to hold sessions with the Chief Executive Panel and the Providence
    Directorate to finalize the demands, but the final number is expected to be high.\n\n\"I
    would be surprised if the net compensation of either entity is below 5 billion
    ISK,\" says Sandere Lourdhen, an economic analyst working for the State and Region
    Bank. \"The citizens of the Caldari State have suffered in this matter, and Lai
    Dai has probably lost substantial amounts of ISK invested in the lost research.\""
