    alike scrambling for an explanation, Caldari Constructions stock is currently
    skyrocketing upwards, regaining and then surpassing almost all of the value lost
    when news of the worker uprising began. Setting an all-time high for trade volume,
    the abrupt change leaves Constructions stock as the only Caldari security listed
    on the CSE with a net positive gain on the day. \"There was a big buyer out there
    when all the commotion started,\" one trader commented. \"He\u2019s been there
    all day, taking the stock in just as fast as everyone else was shorting it. Now
    all the institutions are exposed on the upside and trying to buy shares back as
    fast as they can, pushing the  thing up even higher.\" The Secure Commerce Commission
    is equally perplexed, and monitoring the Armor Forge developments closely. \"In
    light of the day\u2019s events on Piak III, let\u2019s just say that we\u2019re
    watching these trades closely and leave it at that,\" an anonymous SCC official
    commented.   \n  \n  \n[Archive and Comments \xBB](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=762568)"
