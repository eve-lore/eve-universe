    Zarzakh Report: Hrada-Oki Memorial \n\nDISCLAIMER: The Scope cannot verify the
    veracity of this individual\u2019s account of events and their opinions do not
    represent the opinions of the Scope. We trust that our readers have the capacity
    to decide for themselves what is an appropriate degree of skepticism to apply
    to the following narrative.\n\nDespite my best efforts, I am still alive. Others
    have been less fortunate.\n\nLet\u2019s smother any speculations over why I have
    not been ordered to exit the fulcrum through the nearest airlock. A memorial was
    held today and this is not the time for my factory default naval gazing. Yesterday,
    the Hrada-Oki held their own clan-exclusive funeral rites in a manner and location
    unknown. I would like to imagine they committed the remains of their comrades
    back to the cold vacuum of the Great Wildlands that birthed them. The thought
    brings more comfort than the bitter bottle I drained in their name.\n\nToday\u2019s
    memorial was for the rest of us, the sedentary denizens of this colossus. Members
    of every ring of the Deathless Circle came out to pay their respects, from the
    Wraiths to the Custodians. Some Satori-Horigu suits even showed up and bowed their
    perfectly quaffed heads. Some Angel Cartel affiliates sild in, and even the Guristas
    stopped by to pay a pirate's due. The Guristas have been known to associate with
    the Fraternal aggressors who ushered a number of the departed onto their final
    journey, but a shared understanding of professionally negotiable allegiance meant
    that none were sour over the contradiction. Even Vepas Minimala, elder statesman
    of the Ninth Mega, was spotted in the crowd.\n\nCaravanmaster Malaya Hrada read
    a list of the names of every single crew member who passed, a process that proved
    the crowd\u2019s respect by testing their patience. As she spoke, her face was
    dark, but her eyes were clear. Beside her sat the grand treasure that justified
    all that frozen blood floating out in Avenod \u2014 an Atavum. \n\nShe ended her
    list with praise for the capsuleers who had declined to kill her family members,
    \u201CI thank all those who remained true, and made sure that our clanners' cargo
    completed its journey when they could not. We honor Voana Itovuo, first to deliver
    an Atavum into our hands. Like the others who fought beside us she asked for neither
    riches nor glory, our Journey\u2019s Shield. From that first Atavum, our scientists
    were able to determine what we would need to reveal the mystery that haunts our
    system. \n\n\u201CNow they have built a research facility to which all the Atavum
    scattered across the cluster can be brought and studied so we may better understand
    the secrets of this forgotten technology. Dr. Esme Moreno will join them in these
    efforts, uncovering new insights.\u201D\n\nMalaya pointed into the crowd at the
    flustered visage of Dr. Esme Moreno. A Chemal Tech geneticist brought to the Fulcrum
    by some capsuleer who goes by \u201CRabbit-P\u201D, Esme has long since abandoned
    her highsec origins. Now the good doctor is one of the Circle\u2019s top minds.
    According to a lab tech I regularly entertain with my stories of misfortune, Moreno
    has been working on bleeding edge genetic manipulations in partnership with some
    hood-wearing-chanting types.\n\n\u201CThe Deathless himself has put out another
    call for more Atavum,\u201D Malaya continued \u201Cand these mysterious devices
    are already pouring in.  There is a secret hidden outside our doors and if we
    can understand it will be one step closer to achieving the future we all fight
    for.\u201D This was met by loud applause from the crowd, though a louder silence
    from the Angels and Guristas present. \u201CA future my people have bled for time
    and time again. Today we honor their names, tomorrow we finish what they started.\u201D\n\nCheers
    echoed so loudly you\u2019d think the walls screamed in unison. Glasses were raised,
    and I myself dove deep into my cups. The honored dead passed on in the dishonorable
    manner those of their lifestyle often do. Every one of them was a roughneck vagabond,
    a thief, a murderer, a petty outlaw, but they were also my friends.\n\n### New
