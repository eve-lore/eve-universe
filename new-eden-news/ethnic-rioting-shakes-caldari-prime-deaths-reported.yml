- body: Luminaire - **Breaking News** \- At least a dozen deaths have been reported
    as reaction to the hate crimes and acts of vandalism against Caldari landmarks
    on Caldari Prime led to violence. Clashes between Caldarian expatriates and ethnic
    Gallenteans are underway in the major cities of Tovil and Arcurio as Federation
    riot police attempt to contain the violence. Reports of death and injury are filing
    in from industrial sites in the periphery of the city, where the riots are believed
    to have started. Eyewitness accounts describe enraged Caldari workers turning
    against Gallentean proprietors, who in turn are defending themselves with "all
    means at their disposal", including the use of deadly force. Municipal Federation
    police are urging citizens to "stay out of harm's way" by remaining at home or
    within the more secure central districts.
