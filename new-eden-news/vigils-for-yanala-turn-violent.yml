- body: '_The Citadel - _Soon after news of [Caldari Navy](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari
    Navy) Executive Officer Mininela Erinen''s testimony about Admiral Yanala''s death
    was released, several memorial services for the war hero suddenly turned into
    impromptu protests as people called for answers from State Executor [Tibus Heth](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tibus
    Heth). Several of the protests subsequently turned violent, when demonstrators
    clashed with [Provist](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Providence Directorate)
    forces. So far, no deaths have been reported, though hundreds have been reported
    as injured.


    Into the morning, Caldari citizens have continued to react with disbelief and
    anger to the news. Said one protestor who works for [Lai Dai](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Lai
    Dai Corporation), "Tibus Heth must give an accounting of himself. He can''t sit
    silent in his iron tower and expect us to accept this. Admiral Yanala was a hero
    and he cannot simply expect us to forget about this."


    Others have reacted with slightly greater reservation. Said a middle manager from
    [Hyasyoda](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Hyasyoda Corporation), "We''ve only
    heard one side of the story. Obviously if true it''s horrible. But anyone who
    is rioting is just participating in a mob mentality. There''s no proof about what
    she''s said. It''s her word against the State Executor''s. We must wait for the
    CEP to finish their investigation."'
