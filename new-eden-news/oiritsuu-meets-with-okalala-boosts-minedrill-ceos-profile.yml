- body: "Korama - Haatakan ___Oiritsuu, special envoy for State Executor Tibus Heth,
    paid a visit to the Sela constellation yesterday. While the official purpose of
    her visit was to tour a number of stations belonging to Kaalakiota and its subsidiaries,
    she took time from her schedule to meet with Minedrill CEO and Ishukone CEO contender
    Soisonen Okalala at his headquarters around Korama VI._\n\n \n\n_According to
    Minedrill spokesman Etsen Kazorose, the two discussed a number of topics, including
    the occupation of Caldari Prime, and Mr. Okalala's future plans for his company.
    \  \"Minedrill has been greatly honored by Ms. Oiritsuu's visit, and Mr. Okalala
    looks forward to working more closely with both Kaalakiota and the Caldari Providence
    Directorate in the future,\" he told reporters._\n\n \n\n_No other corporate CEO
    outside the patriot bloc has received such a high-profile visit from someone so
    close to the Executor in months.   As a result, some observers have wondered aloud
    whether it was Ishukone's declining fortunes and their potential effect on the
    greater Caldari economic recovery that prompted the visit, or if it was simply
    a case of the Executor showing who he favors. \"If we see Oiritsuu paying a visit
    to Ishukone Watch headquarters in the near future,\" said _Games of State_ host
    Shiomiken Savalenta on her most recent program, \"we'll know the Directorate is
    starting to realize how bad this situation really is.\"_"
