- body: 'POSTOUVIN - The Scope Galactic News Network has reached out to the Society
    of Conscious Thought in the last hour, after a flotilla of construction vessels
    began to arrive in close proximity to the stricken Astral Mining RP4 Hemorphite
    processing installation.


    The vessels, which all carry SoCT markings and identification transponders, appear
    to have commenced the deployment of an Upwell Consortium designed construction
    scaffold, with numerous jump freighter class vessels arriving to deliver materials
    and personnel to the site which is within visual distance of the Kyonoke contaminated
    facility.


    Both the Society of Conscious Thought and the press office for the Upwell Consortium,
    as well as the Federal administration, who would need to approve any construction
    project in their sovereign territory, have declined to comment on this new development,
    or what the intention of the construction project may be.'
