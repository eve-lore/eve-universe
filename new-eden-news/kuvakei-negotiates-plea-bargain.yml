- body: "**LUMINAIRE:** The decision to release Vorada Kuvakei has left many Federation
    citizens questioning the direction of the Supreme Court. \n\nMore questions than
    answers have been generated, especially surrounding the role of Illoren in the
    recent Rise debacle. \n\n\u201CWe have decided not to prosecute Vorada Kuvakei
    and his Illoren associates after the lawyers representing him entered a plea bargain,\u201D
    stated a press release from the offices of the attorney general.\n\n\u201CIn return
    for their expulsion from Federation territory, and a fifty year gag order on matters
    relating to their role in the recent operations to destroy a smuggling ring in
    Placid, they are being released with no charges. \n\n\u201CWe would like to stress,
    however, that this is not an indication that they are innocent of the charges
    that they were originally arrested for,\u201D added the statement.\n\nWhen we
    tried to contact Kuvakei to ask his viewpoint, his lawyers indicated that they
    had nothing further to add to the official Federation report.\n\nThe trial for
    the leader of the Serpentis group known as Cobra Squadron, Commodore Sylvaine
    Ouvrard, is scheduled to begin early next year. She is charged with Trafficking
    of a Controlled Item, Working for an Illegal Organisation, and Murder. Typically,
    the Serpentis Corporation declined to comment."
