- body: "In an official visit to Athra, Idonis Ardishapur is believed to have ordered
    the immediate arrest, torture and execution of Ray Hardman, a freelance journalist.
    The arrest is said to come after the journalist interrupted a scripted press event
    with questions regarding a debated decision by the Amarr Imperial Succession Committee
    of allowing pilots of other races than Amarr to assist the \"pure blooded\" Amarrian
    champions in their upcoming combat duels.   \n  \nWhile at first ignoring the
    reporter, Ardishapur finally answered that the house of Ardishapur had no intention
    of letting \"undeserving savage creatures\" represent the house in such monumental
    decision making. He went on to discuss at length the risk that heresy poses to
    Amarrian civilisation today and the recent disintegration of its core values.
    Ardishapur then applauded the relentless work of the Amarrian Inquisition, claiming:
    \"They are a role model to both young disciples of Amarrian religious doctrine
    as well as devout citizens throughout the universe.\"   \n  \nThe remainder of
    the press event was cancelled. Enquiries regarding the fate of Ray Hardman were
    met with silence from Ardishapur officials."
