- body: "Amarr champion Ecliptical was slain by an unnamed assailant of Omega Corp,
    this morning at 7:20 GMT in the 7R5-7R system, deep in the Stain region. While
    reports of the killing are conflicting, it is evident that Ecliptical's escape
    pod was breached, prompting his clone to be initiated. Emperor Doriam Kor-Azor
    was not available for comment, but his son Articio is claimed to have said \u201CWell
    I\u2019m not in mourning. This man fought for my father, true, but who in their
    right mind wouldn\u2019t? Should we celebrate every man who does his duty?\u201D
    Articio went on slandering this proclaimed hero of Amarr and made lewd remarks
    about Amarr heirs Uriam Kador and Catiz-Tash Murkon, unfit for print.   \n  \nArticio
    is thought to be trying to divert attention from the imminent handover of the
    enslaved Crielere scientists to a Gallentean delegation, following a secret deal
    brokered by Gallentean president Foiritan. Ecliptical\u2019s fresh clone was unavailable
    for comment and is believed to be gathering his thoughts, and quite possibly,
    plotting revenge."
