- body: '3-CE1R - The recent Sansha''s Nation attacks took a dramatic turn yesterday
    after a probe launched by capsuleer Mouse Nell recovered the [first images](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1342784
    "GalNet Communication by Mouse Nell") from the other side of the wormhole used
    by Nation vessels.


    Imagery relayed by the probe revealed a massed Nation fleet idling outside a station
    of Jovian design. DED Signals Intelligence has confirmed the feed as authentic
    and CONCORD Special Operative Haeldone Dorgiers has also [confirmed the station
    as the Prosper Vault](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1342779&page=1#16
    "GalNet Communication by Graelyn") in 3-CE1R, the same system where capsuleer
    pilots had previously located members of True Power and True Creations.


    The presence of Sansha''s Nation vessels within Jovian Directorate space has brought
    renewed urgency to debates about how best to deal with the Sansha threat, and
    many experts suspect it will only be a matter of time before representatives of
    the empires begin to demand answers not only from CONCORD, but from the Jovian
    Directorate as well, who have so far made no official comment.'
