- body: "Activities in Pure Blind have seen an increase recently with Mordu\u2019s
    Legion and RAZOR Alliance pilots operating in this region.   \n  \nInitially,
    a patrol last Thursday surrounding the 5ZXX-K system culminated in the establishment
    of a no fly zone around the Mordu\u2019s Testing facility - designed to ensure
    a successful deployment of two Phoenix class Dreadnaughts belonging to the Legion.
    Three days later another patrol was launched, first covering all the systems surrounding
    5ZXX-K then proceeding on to Torrinos, where the patrol reformed into an escort
    fleet for a RAZOR Freighter destined to return to 5ZXX-K.   \n  \nHeated exchanges
    between the patrol and Jericho Fraction pilots were reported to have taken place
    during this second operation, with a warning issued by the Legion pilots against
    further harassing of RAZOR pilots by members of the Jericho Fraction.   \n  \nTwo
    Legion Pilots stand out in all of these events \u2013 Lieutenant Amerlik Raun,
    who is believed to have recently been demoted from his position of common flight
    commander due to losses sustained to the Legion during its withdrawl from ORE
    space, and Colonel Akuras, who is believed to had taken Raun\u2019s former post.
    Both pilots were unavailable for comment. The arrival of two Dreadnaughts and
    two high ranking officials of Mordu\u2019s Legion in the systemt,namely Major
    Koinahaila and the Colonel, each piloting a Dreadnaught,leaves a large portion
    of the universe wondering what exactly the Legion has planned for this Region."
