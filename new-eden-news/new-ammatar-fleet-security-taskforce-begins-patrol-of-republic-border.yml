    - The Ammatar Fleet has announced that the newly formed 5th Derelik Border Security
    Task Force is to begin a 6-month tour of duty patrolling the Ammatar Mandate border
    with the Minmatar Republic this week. Comprised of a core of three 'Yonis variant'
    Abaddon-class battleships and numerous Apocalypse- and Armageddon-class battleships,
    the task force is charged with \"maintaining the integrity of the borders of the
    Amarr Empire and destroying all threats to the security of the Ammatar Mandate.\"\n\nIn
    other developments, it has emerged that several penal regiments are currently
    being raised within the Ammatar Mandate. Sources within the Ammatar Consulate
    indicate that dishonored men and officers of the Ammatar Fleet and Ammatar planetary
    defense forces are being offered the choice of service in penal regiments as an
    alternative to permanent slavery as punishment for their failings during the Elder
    Invasion.\n\nIt is also reported that failed defectors and the families of defectors
    who have come under suspicion are also being offered the chance to serve in penal
    units rather than being convicted of collusion with defectors and entering formal
    slavery. The appeal of these offers lies in the fact that formal enslavement would
    in most cases lead to the dependents and descendants of the enslaved joining them
    in slavery. Ardishapur authorities have declared their \"hope that the mercy of
    Lord Ardishapur will lead to the redemption of these lost souls.\""
