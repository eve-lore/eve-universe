    According to reports from sources within the Caldari Business Tribunal and the
    Lai Dai and Sukuuvestaa Corporations, The Caldari Business Tribunal has called
    for a closed-doors hearing of representatives from the Sukuuvestaa and Lai Dai
    corporations, according to sources within the Tribunal and the megacorporations.
    Several directors of Lai Dai and Sukuuvestaa are expected to attend the special
    tribunal session tomorrow, the details of which remain largely unknown. \n\nBoth
    corporations have been enduring security strains in recent months, including a
    swathe of apparent sabotage attempts on Lai Dai assets and a series of terrorist
    assaults on Sukuuvestaa stations. The Caldari Business Tribunal initiated its
    own investigation last week into the attacks on Sukuuvestaa.\n\nFurther details
    will be reported as they are made available."
