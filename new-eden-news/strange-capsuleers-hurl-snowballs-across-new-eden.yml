- body: "In an unusual occurrence in the afternoon of December 13th, a number of individuals
    throughout New Eden were suddenly accosted by snowball -throwing capsuleers. This
    unusual group of capsuleers would suddenly appear in a system, declaring their
    quest for \"good snowball fights\". After a few brief exchanges of snowballs launched
    from the newly distributed Festival Launchers, the capsuleers - spouting off nonsense
    about \"Sansha Claus\" and his Revenant pulled by 9 Nightmares - would vanish
    just as suddenly as they had appeared, leaving behind nothing but some extra snowballs
    and a few very confused locals.\n\n No injuries were reported from the strange
    occurrence, though CONCORD later attributed the unusual activities to malfunctioning
    Slave implants and are seeking out others who may be affected by similar issues."
