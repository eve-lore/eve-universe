- body: "The new Amarr Emperor Doriam II is taking a very hands-on approach to his
    running of affairs of his domain. Since his inauguration he has been on the move
    constantly, traveling from one system to another. He states he wants to \u2018get
    intimate\u2019 with his subjects and learn every detail about his vast domain.
    Some have voiced their concern over this manic approach, saying it keeps Doriam
    from seeing the big picture, but the populace is ecstatic with the interest their
    beloved leader is taking in the daily life of the Commoners.   \n  \nDoriam has
    also found the time to visit abroad and attended a meeting at CONCORD headquarters
    recently. The issue being discussed was the increased threat posed by pirates
    and other bandit elements in the outer regions. Doriam expressed his concerns
    in the matter and suggested an inter-racial committee should be formed to further
    look into it, highlighting the Emperor\u2019s great belief in bureaucratic process
    and teamwork. His suggestion was met with some skepticism from the delegates of
    the other empires and was not supported, though no definite decision was made
    regarding the pirate threat."
