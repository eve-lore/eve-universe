- body: "KOURMONEN - The missing Amarr Navy scout patrol has been recovered near the
    Kourmonen system. After re-establishing communication, the patrol was able to
    return to their position with the fleet. At this moment, the patrol has sustained
    no discernible losses, and has issued several benign comms in local channels.
    The fleet was instructed to use only scrambled communications until the patrol
    was found.  \n  \nIn the moments following the Amarr Navy alert, the Republic
    Fleet deployed ships in the Auga system and declared a defensive stance, denying
    any involvement in the missing Amarr patrol while emphasizing their intent to
    defend their space.   \n  \nNo official response has been issued from the Amarr
    Navy. The Navy remains at maximum alert in Kourmonen, and all communications are
    now scrambled."
