- body: "New Caldari - For the second time in as many weeks, agile technology research
    firm Itsukame Innovations has thrust itself into the spotlight in the Caldari
    tech sector. Noted for their recent poaching of high-profile researcher Dr. Grant
    Arataka from the Lai Dai Corporation, Itsukame made headlines again today with
    an exciting press release. Hentainnen Suuvosa, spokeswoman for Itsukame Innovations
    announced today that her corporation had made a major breakthrough in the field
    of wormhole technology. \"Itsukame has pioneered and perfected the use of unstable
    wormholes for transport purposes. We expect to revolutionize the way in which
    corporations are able to transport ships across significant distances.\" Somewhat
    coy when pressed for details, Miss Suuvosa would only add that this new advancement
    in technology would bring the capability of the supercapital-sized mobile jump-bridge
    to a battleship-sized platform, radically reducing the costs of production and
    deployment.   \n  \nDue to the nature and the probable uses to which such an advancement
    will be put, Itsukame's new invention has been classed as a military technology
    by the Secure Commerce Commission. As such, it falls under the auspices of CONCORD
    Directive Alpha Gamma 12, a clause in the CONCORD agreement designed to maintain
    arms technology parity between the signatories to the Yulai Treaty. An outgrowth
    of the political firestorm resulting from the Jovians' sharing of capsule technology
    exclusively with Ishukone, the Directive seeks to ensure that advances capable
    of tipping the delicate balance of power are shared, yet the developers of said
    technologies can still turn a tidy profit from licensing fees. At this stage,
    Itsukame Innovations is set to enter negotiations with the SCC Patent Office in
    order to ensure that the technology is not an infringement of existing patents.
    Should the work prove to be non-derivative, Itsukame will be able to set its own
    asking price for licenses to manufacture this new technology. Kaalakiota and Roden
    Shipyards have both already expressed interest.   \n  \nIn a public statement
    shortly following the Itsukame announcement, Hien Karnuras, Chief Financial Officer
    of the Caldari Chief Executive Panel expressed enthusiasm about Itsukame's latest
    revelation. \"I think that this shows that the Caldari State continues to lead
    the way in the pioneering of new technologies. This kind of innovation is good
    for the Caldari economy, and capitalizing upon these successes builds significant
    value for our citizen-shareholders.\" When asked whether the Chief Executive Panel
    Bureau would be involved in the patent negotiations, Karnuras added \"Of course
    the CEP will do everything we can to support Itsukame's bid for exclusive patent
    rights. Doing so is clearly in the State's best interest.\"   \n  \nThe SCC patent
    investigation and verification period is expected to take several weeks."
