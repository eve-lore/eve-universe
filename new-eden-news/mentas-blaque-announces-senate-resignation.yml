    After a long and distinguished career, Senator Mentas Blaque announced today that
    he would be stepping down from his elected position in the Gallente Senate effective
    immediately. With over two years remaining in his current term, Senator Blaque's
    early departure will trigger a special election within his home district to name
    a successor.\n\nOf greater importance is the loss of Blaque's leadership role
    as the Head of Senate. For years, Mentas Blaque has had a direct hand in shaping
    Gallente policy, and has used this influence in advancing his political agenda.
    An internal election will be held over the next few days, in which the Senate
    will promote one of its current members to the vacant position.\n\nIn his surprise
    announcement made from the Senate floor at the conclusion of this afternoon's
    session, Senator Blaque stated that this move is far from a total departure from
    public life. Indeed, Mentas Blaque will continue to serve as head of the Federal
    Intelligence Office, an appointment that was re-confirmed by President Jacus Roden.
    Given the recent acrimony caused by Blaque's unique position in both the legislative
    and executive branches of government, this move is seen as a way to appease his
    harshest critics. Some political experts have suggested that this was a back-room
    deal brokered by President Roden. If true, this move could indicate that Roden
    has been able to deliver what several attempts at internal Senate censure could
    not.\n\nMore jaded political commentators continue to criticize Blaque however,
    going so far as to imply that this move allows him to concentrate his energies
    in the FIO, where he can act without the intervention of the Federation Senate."
