- body: "The Privy Council has ordered the Royal Amarr Institute and Hedion University
    to conduct an investigation into the legitimacy of \"historical facts\" surrounding
    the temple of 'God\u2019s Assuring Whisper'. The temple is said to be an Amarrian
    religious centre which was destroyed during the Moral Reforms. The edict follows
    last week\u2019s successful recovery of religious artifacts by the Order of St.
    Tetrimon; believed to have originated from within the ancient temple site.   \n
    \ \nThe existence of the relics was allegedly uncovered in the scriptures by followers
    of the Tetrimon Cult. Described by the Cult as 'holy statues', symbolic of faith
    and servitude, they are said to have once stood in the halls of 'God\u2019s Assuring
    Whisper' and \"watched over Amarrians receiving training on how to walk the path
    of God and work in the spirit of the Reclaiming.\" The Tetrimon Cult believes
    that the recovery of the statues will herald the coming of a new Reclaiming that
    will \"bring God\u2019s faith to all.\"   \n  \nSources within the Privy Council
    have commented that its members have been furtively discussing the religious significance
    of the artifacts. While the council itself is reported to have been pressuring
    the Theology Council to commit more resources to the study of the Holy Scriptures
    and verify the story behind the temple and its relics.   \n  \nIn recent weeks
    scholars from across the Empire with links to the Theology Council have been seen
    arriving in the Amarr Solar System where the Tetrimon scriptures are being kept.
    The assembly of theologians has been seen by many individuals as a reaction to
    the increased pressure to complete the study of the religious texts."
