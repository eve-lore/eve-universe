    regarding a schism among the Five Heirs. The Succession Rites, which dictate the
    family heads not chosen as emperor commit ritual suicide, are believed to be the
    root cause of this possible split. \n\n\u201CMilitary and transport craft are
    being amassed in ruling families\u2019 home systems,\u201D said Elgad Bettild,
    a political analyst for Republic Fleet. \u201CIt could be a protection of assets
    during a time of crisis; it could be preparation for war. But combined with the
    rumors we\u2019re receiving, it could signal something like secession, perhaps
    even civil war.\u201D \n\nBettild went on to say that Khanid II, by refusing to
    commit suicide at the selection of the emperor prior to Heideran VII, has set
    a precedent. \u201CKhanid II is a living bogeyman, proof that an heir can defy
    the Succession Rite and go on to be a force of no small magnitude. He was an anomaly
    for his day, but times have changed.\u201D \n\nEsten Legalou, a Gallente expert
    on Amarr culture for Federation Navy, feels a split would be unlikely. \u201CFrom
    birth, the heads of the Five Heir families are groomed for assumption of the mantle
    of Emperor--the assumption of godhead. They believe they become divine through
    the Succession Rite; not being chosen to receive that divinity is a devastating
    experience. I think many of the failed heirs have seen the ritual suicide not
    only as a sacred duty, but as a welcome relief.\u201D \n\nBettild disagrees. \u201CReligious
    belief or no, the feelings that made Khanid II refute the Succession Rites are
    more common in Amarr life now, especially among those who live in opulence. It
    would be easy to imagine one or more of the current family heads refusing what
    they see as an unnecessary death.\u201D"
