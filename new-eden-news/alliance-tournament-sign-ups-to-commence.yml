- body: "The official registration period for capsuleer alliances wishing to participate
    in the upcoming Alliance Tournament will begin today, a spokesperson for the Caldari
    Gaming Commission has announced. The contest is the second of its kind to be held
    by the CGC and the first matches are scheduled to commence on the 14th of July.
    \  \n  \nAs with the previous tournament the Executor Corporation CEO of those
    alliances wishing to participate will be required to register on behalf of their
    alliance at the [tournament sign-up page.](http://myeve.eve-online.com/events/alliances/tournament/)
    \  \n  \nRegistration for the tournament will continue for two weeks, during which
    time the first one hundred and twenty eight alliances to register will be given
    a place in the competition. The CGC has also stated that the top sixteen alliances
    from the last tournament will be guaranteed a position if they choose to compete
    by registering.   \n  \nUnlike in the first tournament, teams will consist of
    five combatants, each piloting a different ship class ranging from frigates to
    battleships. Organisers are hopeful that the inclusion of destroyer and battlecruiser
    class vessels in the contest will dramatically improve upon the tactical aspect
    of the competition, and provide far more spectacular and entertaining battles
    than in the previous tournament.   \n  \nEdouard D'Evereux, a Professor of Mixed
    Unit Tactics at the Federal Navy Academy, has applauded the decision to include
    the newer ship classes. \u201CHistory has repeatedly shown us that it is not necessarily
    the side with the best technology that wins a battle, but the side that makes
    better use of its units and tactics to defeat the enemy.\u201D He went on to express
    his interest in how the capsuleer alliances might make use of the newer ship types
    in the tournament. \u201CI think the Command Ship battlecruiser variants will
    really show their full potential for squad-based warfare in this tournament.\u201D
