- body: 'POSTOUVIN - A sizeable convoy of vessels registered to Poteque Pharmaceuticals
    arrived at the Kyonoke Inquest Center this morning after the Inquest itself concluded
    yesterday.


    More than a hundred Obelisk class freighters rumoured to be carrying decontamination
    equipment, medical supplies, provisions and additional remote operated exploration
    equipment have docked with the Keepstar class structure over the course of the
    morning, with the mammoth task of unloading tens of millions of tons of equipment
    now underway.


    Similar scenes have been unfolding in Muttokon, Oijanen and Efu as scientists
    prepare for further analysis of the Kyonoke Plague and widespread testing, along
    with additional action after the conclusion of the Inquest proper.


    The action, which is occurring simultaneously across four regions of space and
    involves countless staff and vessels, is widely regarded as the largest single
    logistical operation ever undertaken in New Eden.


    The Scope will report more on the situation over the course of the coming days
    as it develops.'
