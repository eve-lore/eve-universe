- body: "SEYLLIN - Evacuation of the suffering population of Seyllin  \nI is likely
    to be the biggest humanitarian effort in  \nrecent years. The assembled host of
    Federation,  \nSerpentis, CONCORD, ORE and independent vessels - an  \nunlikely
    sight under normal circumstances - is doing its  \nbest to rescue as many as 500
    million people from the  \nsurface of the radiation blast-stricken planet.   \n
    \ \nInkori Nadoux, a Federation Navy sergeant who spent the  \nlast two and a
    half hours on Seyllin I, agreed to speak to  \nThe Scope news team.   \n  \n\"We
    were dispatched to Seyllin as soon as the distress  \ncalls started pouring in,
    and my team got deployed to a  \nresidential spaceport in Southern Cross. Our
    task was to  \nassist the evacuation of a residential quarter that was  \nreportedly
    hit worse than the others.\"  \n  \n\"I've seen my share of fighting, but I have
    never  \nwitnessed such nightmare. It is hell down there. But I have  \nthis to
    say - I have also never witnessed so many different  \npeople working together.
    I have seen a Serpentis MTAC squad  \nwading through pools of molten metal to
    rescue a bunch of  \nkids; I have seen people throwing themselves into the fire
    \ \nto save complete strangers.\"  \n  \nAfter two hours in Southern Cross, Sergeant
    Nadoux's team  \nwas pulled back into orbit, suffering severe radiation  \nburns
    despite heavy protection. They had been confined to  \nthe healthcare ward onboard
    CONCORD battleship Redoubt, but  \nthey are not willing to rest.  \n  \n\"After
    we get our rad treatment, we are going back in.\""
