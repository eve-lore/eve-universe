- body: "Derelik \u2013 A deep-space salvage crew reported the discovery of a large
    wreckage field in the T-W4L3 constellation, possibly connected to the lost pilgrimage
    fleet that left Republic space weeks ago. \n\nIonos Skye, captain of the salvage
    ship \u201CBated Breath\u201D reported the find to Republic Authorities upon having
    made safe return to Nimambal with his cargo. Intentionally vague about the exact
    size and location of his find, Skye would only say that the field \u201Clooked
    to be about a dozen medium size ships\u201D. \n\nSkye went on record as saying
    the find was \u201Cwell away from most usual trade routes,\u201D and that he found
    it \u201Cmostly by chance\u201D. He was unable to positively identify any of the
    ships in the wreckage field as belonging to the lost fleet however. \n\nGiven
    the unconfirmed nature of the find, recently appointed representatives for the
    families of the pilgrims have declined commentary \u2013 stating only that \u201Ctheir
    clients reaffirm their hope and faith that their loved ones will return safely
    from their journey\u201D."
