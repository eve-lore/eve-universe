- body: "Rens - Responding to yesterday's unintentional blinding of two Brutor youths,
    concerned advocate groups have called on Sanmatar Shakor to make a statement to
    the youth of the Republic, urging them to forgo such potentially damaging acts
    of hero worship. \n\nA brief statement delivered by the teens' clan elder indicated
    the youths \"simply wanted to show their respect and admiration for the Sanmatar
    and his Defiant ancestors.\" \n\nIn light of this event, as well as the ongoing
    trend of hero-worshiping youth across the Republic, the advocate group Concerned
    Parents of Matar has called on the Sanmatar to dissuade other young people from
    similar or more drastic acts. \n\nSpokespeople for the Republic government have
    declined to comment on whether such a statement will be forthcoming, saying only
    that \u201CSanmatar Shakor has many issues demanding his personal attention at
    this time. He will surely give this issue his full consideration as soon as he
    is able.\u201D"
