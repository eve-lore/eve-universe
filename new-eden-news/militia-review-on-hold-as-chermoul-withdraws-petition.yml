    Senator Chermoul has addressed the press regarding the [ recent turmoil within
    the Defense Committee]( http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=3238&tid=5),
    and announced a formal withdrawal of his petition.\n\nIn the days since several
    committee members [called for the removal of chairman Vance Opheron]( http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=3240&tid=5),
    no less than fourteen senators and local governors have formally withdrawn their
    support for the petition. Less than an hour ago the Defense Committee held a vote
    on the position of Senator Opheron, which passed with a majority wishing him to
    remain committee chairman.\n\nSenator Chermoul elaborated further on his reasons
    for the formal withdrawal. \"I think the committee, and the petty bickering within,
    will prove to do more harm than good if it continues. The concerns of the petitioners
    and myself are purely for the best defense of our space. No good will come from
    infighting. So we have decided to withdraw our petition and will seek alternative
    recourse.\"\n\nIn response to this, the Defense Committee and the Federal Navy
    have archived their incomplete reports on the Federal Defense Union and ended
    their [ respective reviews]( http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=3233&tid=5).
    It is not expected that the Senate's Defense Committee will release their report
    incomplete. Representatives declined to comment on their findings to date, stating
    it would be inappropriate to disseminate incomplete information of this nature.\n\nSenator
    Chermoul concluded his discussion with the media by stating, \"I firmly believe
    from what we have witnessed here today that the current system of oversight cannot
    cover an organization such as the Federal Defense Union, unique as it is. Many
    petition supporters and myself agree that a dedicated department overseeing the
    affairs of the militia would help put minds at ease over their defense readiness.\""
