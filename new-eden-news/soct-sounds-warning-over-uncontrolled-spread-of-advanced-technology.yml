    Sounds Warning Over Uncontrolled Spread of Advanced Technology in Pirate Hands\n\nYulai,
    Genesis \u2013 Elder Mentor Matshi Raish of the Society of Conscious Thought (SoCT)
    has warned of \"grave and potentially catastrophic consequences\" over the apparent
    uncontrolled spread of advanced technologies among networks of criminals and pirate
    groups across New Eden.\n\nIn remarks to journalists ahead of a CONCORD Inner
    Circle meeting that will include fresh negotiations on technology-sharing and
    technology controls between the New Eden empires. CONCORD insiders expect the
    issue of increasing pirate and organized crime group access to cutting-edge technology
    will sharply color the topic of restrictions on exploitation of so-called \"ancient\"
    technologies and those derived from sources such as the Triglavian Collective,
    Sleepers, or Drifters.\n\nThe Society of Conscious Thought has been so concerned
    by the recent activities of the self-styled \"Guri Malakim\" pirate group as to
    sponsor independent capsuleers to engage in countervailing operations targeting
    criminal exploitation of sites such as ancient Jove Observatories. Elder Matshi
    Raish emphasized the \"serious risk of this alliance of thieves and murderers
    precipitating a new emergent risks crisis at a time when New Eden's civilization
    is beset by internal and internecine conflicts.\"\n\nThe Guri Malakim group appears
    to be an alliance of convenience between subgroups of the Guristas Pirates and
    the Angel Cartel focused on acquisition of advanced technology. Notably, the coalition
    is believed to be led by notorious criminal operatives and technology acquisition
    specialists Esri Hakuzosu and Rafik Zohar. \n\nHakuzosu is a Guristas agent who
    came to widespread notice as the leader of a ring of spies within Caldari Navy
    capital ship research and development programs operating out of the Jita 4-4 trade
    hub station. Zohar is well-known to law enforcement as the leader of a highly-capable
    and brutally efficient Cartel assault and retrieval team. The Commando Zohar group
    is responsible for a number of high-profile technology heists, culminating in
    the hijack of an ORE research vessel and scientists working on valuable materials
    compression technology.\n\n![Esri Hakuzosu profile x](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/7GfonQKB49YyxjuSThUjQ2/eef5769eed74e6cedd2b800d03f27349/Esri_Hakuzosu_profile_x.png)

    Inner Circle Meets to Negotiate Economic, Infrastructure and Technology Regulations\n\nYulai,
    Genesis \u2013 CONCORD and \"Big 4\" empire delegates are meeting at the Inner
    Circle in Yulai to negotiate a series of economic, infrastructure, and technology
    regulations and amendments to the Yulai Accords and Convention, despite ongoing
    border wars and serious conflicts over espionage and sabotage operations.\n\nWhile
    CONCORD's leadership has been raising the alarm over rising levels of conflict
    and disruption across New Eden, it is pressure within the political structures
    of the empires that has finally forced delegates from all four empires to the
    negotiating table. In particular, rising concerns among the Amarr nobility at
    the social and economic impact of the new militancy of the Empire, together with
    a number of demands from significant sections of President Aguard's political
    coalition, are thought to have created a more pragmatic approach to the positions
    of the Minmatar Republic and Caldari State.\n\nCaldari State representatives have
    long pursued ever-increasing policies of trade liberalization and this aim has
    not been dampened despite border conflicts and espionage scandals. Amarr markets
    have long been open to Caldari interests but recent blows to diplomatic relations
    between the two powers has raised fears of State market share being lost to eager
    Federation industrial interests. The Caldari have also found pursuit of opportunities
    in Minmatar markets hampered by a webbing of protections, tariffs, and privileged
    status regulations at every level of the Republic's complex economy.\n\nFor their
    part, the Republic has been keen to retain its traditionalist approach to its
    internal markets but has been open to easing many restrictions previously placed
    on Caldari interests. The Minmatar see agreements on economic stimulus, SCC taxes,
    and broker regulations as an essential ingredient of any deal. Minmatar negotiators
    are looking to level the economic playing field and promote investment in their
    domestic industries.\n\nThe Empire and Federation have largely agreed to do away
    with many restrictions on travel and trade that previously existed between the
    two polities. A number of economic sanctions and retaliatory tariff packages levied
    by each against numerous industries and political interests in the other empire
    have been repealed. The Amarr and Federation are now seeking agreements to combat
    widespread smuggling and vast flows of undeclared and illegal funds across New
    Eden. Even though domestic pressures and policy goals have brought the \"Big 4\"
    back to the negotiating table, observers expect hard bargaining over every point
    at issue.\n\n![Intaki V orbital infra](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/3NYeorUCiviiXBVPqnFF6G/447cb457a51a0d36fe06c5d202d42309/Intaki_V_orbital_infra.png)

    Agreement on Intaki Assembly Coalition Still Deadlocked in Third Week of Talks
    \n\nIntaki, Placid \u2013 The prospects for an agreement between elected Intaki
    Assembly members over the construction of a working coalition remain deadlocked
    at the end of a third week of talks on Intaki Prime. \n\nFinal returns from outlying
    Assembly wards on other planets and space colonies in the Intaki system, and from
    eligible non-domiciled Intaki system citizens, have not substantially changed
    a political calculus set by the results of elections held during the first week
    of May. From a total of 319 of the 547 seats available, the previously ruling
    moderate faction headed by Chief Councillor Vera en Sullacio fell to only 234
    elected members.\n\nDespite this blow, the moderate faction made up of members
    of local Intaki affiliates of the Federalist-Liberal and Labor-Populist parties,
    together with the Intaki Social Co-operative Party, remains the largest bloc in
    the Intaki Assembly. The politically insurgent Intaki Autonomists led by Jonas
    Ivestara were able to claim 202 seats, while the radical nationalists of Intaki
    Lamkatka headed by Siaka Idama won 83 seats. The remaining 28 seats are held by
    a diverse collection of local parties and independent politicians unlikely to
    join with any other grouping.\n\nWith serious differences of policy and long-term
    goals existing between the Autonomists and Intaki Lamkatka it has proven impossible
    for the two to forge a coalition that could govern Intaki. While Vera en Sullacio
    has the option of formally declaring a minority administration and requesting
    Federation authorities recognise her government on that basis, she has clearly
    been reluctant to take a step that would be highly incendiary in the present political
    atmosphere on Intaki Prime.\n\nMany eyes are now turning to the Intaki Social
    Co-operative Party, with its 63 seats representing a possible means for the Autonomists
    to build a coalition within striking distance of a majority. Intense discussions
    within the moderate faction are being watched carefully by all as respected members
    of the Autonomists approach moderate and independent members of the Assembly.
    Federation political and military authorities have remained tight-lipped on the
    ongoing impasse, referring all inquiries to the Intaki System Elections Commission
    and the caretaker administration still presided over by Vera en Sullacio.\n\n![RF
