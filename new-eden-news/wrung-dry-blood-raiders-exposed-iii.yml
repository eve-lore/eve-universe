    a little turn away from the practitioners themselves and speak to someone who
    walked the path beside one of the faith\u2019s most famous adherents and who lives
    with the aftermath to this day.\n\nIt\u2019s a sad tale, and a cautionary one.
    But one that deserves to be heard.\n\nMidna Lyre, the Gallente singing starlet,
    perhaps said it best on her latest album when she sang:\n\nMy heart demands my
    broken tongue  \nMust speak to give you what you\u2019re needing  \nDid you not
    care, or just desire  \nTo ever see  \nMy heart is bleeding.\n\n![](http://tinyurl.com/3tvurg)\n\nAllow
    me to introduce Reisha Nafina, known to far more as Verjigorm. Loyalist. Heretic.
    Pirate. And lover.\n\nWho among us can ever truly say our hearts are so safely
    sealed away and buffered from the rigours of the world that, one day, some siren
    song won\u2019t steal us away, turning our whole world on its head and sending
    us stumbling along new paths into the unknown. Even into the dark.\n\nMs Nafina\u2019s
    life has moved in a great circle that has now, at last, brought her back to where
    she feels she has always belonged.\n\n\u201CI began my career when space was still
    fresh and new. Dark Seraph was formed in the earlier days of private space flight.
    We were one of the first Amarrian loyalist corporations. Things were different
    then, of course. Battle was simple and pure before the clutter of the IGS ruined
    modern loyalist warfare. I started there, on the front lines\u2026 From the bridge
    of an omen, when that ship still carried respect.\n\n\u201CDark Seraph was conceived
    as an Order that would live only to serve Our Lady Sarum, to fight and die for
    her. I have always carried that in my heart. We do not fight for the Empire, only
    our house. We leave House Sarum to determine the will of the Empire. This is our
    way.\u201D\n\nVerjigorm evidently has great passion for House Sarum; her eyes
    light up when she speaks of the Late Lady Jamyl, head of House and once heir to
    the Imperial Throne.\n\n\u201CIn the case of Dark Seraph, [the service of Lady
    Sarum] has been our call from the outset. The glory of the Holy Golden Empire
    can be seen through House Sarum and calls upon the Chosen to fight for her banner
    and thusly that of the Empire itself.\u201D\n\nVerjigorm was then First Governor
    of Dark Seraph, and now is again after brief periods in Bloodveil and Knights
    of Chaos.\n\nI first approached Ms Nafina under a misconception it seems many
    share \u2013 that her corporation housed members of the Sani Sabik belief, and
    that she herself is now, or has ever been, a practitioner. She was quick to disabuse
    me of it, and explained how such rumours began:\n\n\u201CMy involvement started
    when we began to see members of Dark Seraph fall to the sway of the Sani Sabik
    cult and others began practicing in the shadows. There were never to my knowledge
    rituals held within the walls of the Order, but there have been members who had
    walked that line, members that have fallen sway completely. One of them being
    my lover\u2026 The one who was my lover, at least.\u201D\n\nI inquired as to the
    identity of this loved one, but the subject was evidently painful for Ms Nafina,
    as she explained:\n\n\u201CI would certainly rather not speak further of her.
    It was a dark time and one that may well have broken my place in the Promised
    Lands, but it was never about reward\u2026 this fight, this Order.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhen
    it became clear that Dark Seraph could no longer hold the blasphemy of those within,
    Lord Jeserat Verisum exposed himself as a follower of an order not unlike Sani
    Sabik called Bloodveil and formed a corporation.\u201D\n\nAnd yet, Ms Nafina herself
    served within Bloodveil for a time. But she did not go until Dark Seraph itself
    was restored to the loyal Sarumite unit it was meant to be.\n\n\u201CWhen things
    were set right within Dark Seraph and all that was unholy was cast out, I followed
    my heart to be with my love. Though not without consequence\u2026 I have never
    followed their faith, only bore their name.\u201D\n\nLike dancing with a lover
    to a song not to your taste - you may not like the music, but it's the price of
    the dance.\n\nThe scent of blood is not easily washed away, however and Verjigorm\u2019s
    efforts to return to her home in Amarr have been met with skepticism and hostility
    by her fellow loyalists.\n\n\u201CThey have labelled me heretic, a title not cast
    off easily. I cannot apologize for what I have done; too much harm was caused.
    I can only resume the fight to my last breath.\n\n\u201CAnd yes, other loyalists
    believe that I am still that woman that struck out under a banner not my own.
    I cannot fault them that, but we do not work to their approval.\u201D\n\nWhat,
    then, was the fateful allure of the Bloodveil sect that pulled so many of Dark
    Seraph into its folds? Ms Nafina mused on the matter:\n\n\u201CThe allure, I think,
    is obvious in its hedonistic call. Those weak of will find the call from the rigidity
    of the Empire tempting. The desires of the flesh made manifest, blasphemy made
    legal, even holy at times\u2026\u201D\n\n\u201CEveryone wants to sell himself
    to the promise of power, and Sani Sabik claim to offer that. Luckily, they are
    largely unsuccessful. They fight with all they have to grasp at something that
    doesn't exist for us. Power. \n\n\u201CBut they fight to wrest it from the hands
    of an Empire that will not release it. The promise of becoming something more
    than human is lost. Battles for such power are not waged in space.\n\n\u201CThe
    ultimate goal of the Sani Sabik is to prove they are born for greatness and thus
    more than those around them. More than human, Gods amongst men, born only to feed
    on those beneath him. They are the most horrendous thoughts of mankind made manifest.\n\n\u201CMany
    things that do not occur in battleships and dreadnaughts. Many much more sweeping
    battles are fought and won through treaties and ink. We capsuleers are insulated
    from that.\u201D\n\nHowever, with the passing of time, Reisha Nafina was able
    to walk away from the heady delights of the Sani Sabik, seeking her own path,
    once again.\n\n\u201CI have often thought the greatest sin any loyalist can commit,
    is to fight for their cause yet not die for it. Living, in a way becomes sin.
    I fought for House Sarum but it was lost and our Lady Lost\u2026\n\n\u201CI lurked
    in a dark corner of zero space for some time, listless, without cause until I
    returned to empire to lead the Endless Corporation, something short lived. The
    lure of my calling was too strong. When I lost Dark Seraph to these cults, my
    heart broke; I was rent asunder by a cause that lost so severely. But these thoughts
    are selfish, without merit. The cause exists with or without me and the fight
    must be fought.\n\n\u201CI didn't return to Dark Seraph, I was called home.\u201D\n\nBut
    this time, Verjigorm took what she had learned in her time away, creating the
    Order of the Black Cross, an alliance around Dark Seraph.\n\n\u201CThe alliance
    was formed as an extension of Dark Seraph, so yes. Ebon Seraph is where those
    who wish to strive for entry into Dark Seraph begin their careers, and where the
    Minmatar remain. Marangrio Space Services is lead by Lufio II, of my most trusted
    friends. And the Airborne Assassins have become some of the most aggressive supporters
    of the cause.\u201D\n\n\u201CWe do not allow the Minmatar into our ranks. Further,
    we would be decidedly hesitant to allow a Gallente in as well. All that enter
    these halls must first swear fealty to the Order, the House, and the Empire. This
    cause demands that all live for, and all stand ready to die for it.\u201D\n\nIt
    seems a hard path for Verjigorm, and all of the Order of the Black Cross to follow.
    Distrusted and spurned by their fellows, they fight for an Empire without an Emperor,
    a House without an Heir. But every step along it takes them further away from
    their past.\n\nWe can only wait and see what the future may hold.<p"
