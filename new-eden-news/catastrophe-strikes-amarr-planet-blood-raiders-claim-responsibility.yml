- body: "At 09:42 EVT this morning, Mabnen I in the Throne Worlds constellation was
    struck by disaster as an unknown aerosol was released into its atmosphere above
    Hemlock Field, an aggregation of slave colonies that stretches across one of the
    planet\u2019s continents and represents one of the single largest indentured worker
    habitats in the Amarr empire.   \n  \nThe fourteen orbit-breacher vessels distributing
    the aerosol were swiftly shot down by regional detachments of the Mabnen Air Force,
    but the damage had already been done: the planet\u2019s strong surface winds had
    caught the toxin and would, within minutes, distribute it throughout most of the
    colonies\u2019 vast territory.   \n  \nEight minutes after the orbit-breachers
    had been shot down and the crisis was thought to have been averted, two of Hemlock
    Field\u2019s twelve colonies were in flames. News cameras have since caught footage
    of Amarrian guards\u2019 disembodied heads, staked out on the parapets girding
    the guard fortress of a colony belonging to Holder Terram Kador.   \n  \nOther
    colonies, too, suffered great upheavals. At 10:08 EVT, roughly 30 minutes after
    the initial attack, seven of the twelve colonies had suffered complete radio communications
    blackouts. Military forces were called in at that point, and at time of going
    to press pitched battles are still being fought between Mabnen Army squadrons
    and the insurgents, most of whom are reportedly armed with little more than stones
    and tools. Four of the colonies have been hit with air strikes. Casualty numbers
    are unknown at this time.   \n  \nOmir Sarikusa, leader of the Blood Raider Covenant,
    at exactly 12:00 noon today released a statement to the media, claiming full responsibility
    for the attack and stating that \u201Ctoday\u2019s exercise was merely the beginning.
    The complacent giant is about to fall, and Insorum shall be the knife in its stomach.\u201D
    He furthermore went on to thank loyalist capsuleer corporation Blood Inquisition
    \u2013 and their associates \u2013 for their \u201Cdiscreet and professional aid\u201D
    in transporting large quantities of the drug to the site of the attack.   \n  \nNeither
    the Emperor nor the Imperial Chancellor has released any form of statement at
    time of going to press, but Emperor Kor-Azor is known to be sitting in council
    with some of his top advisors. A statement is expected either later today or tomorrow.
    \  \n  \nPreliminary estimates of the asset damage caused by the attack are reportedly
    in the vicinity of seventeen billion ISK.   \n  \nMore on the situation as it
    develops."
