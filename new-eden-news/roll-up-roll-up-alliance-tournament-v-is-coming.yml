- body: "**The Alliance Tournament is once again coming to New Eden.** With a field
    of forty alliances baying for blood and looking to make a name for themselves
    we are assured of an exciting spectacle. \n\nThis year the tournament has again
    had rules and groupings amended, one of the key features is the reduction in the
    number of competitors to forty. This caused a rush to register through the official
    GalNet channels and consequently the tournament group slots were filled within
    forty eight hours. This unprecedented event has, understandably, left some alliances
    unable to sign up. \n\nAmongst the casualties unable to join this years tournament
    are the reigning alliance champions HUN Reloaded, former champions Band of Brothers
    and last years semi-finalists Cruel Intentions and Terra Incognita. This has caused
    an uproar amongst GalNet observers with many clamouring for amendments to the
    rules to allow these well established teams to enter. So far the officials have
    remained silent on this subject. \n\nIt should be noted that some of the aforementioned
    teams may be listed as reserves, which means should another alliance drop out
    the first on the reserve list will be able to compete. However the list is classified
    so no one knows exactly who is on it. \n\nThe very existence of a reserve list
    has brought certain tournament activities to light. Namely bribery and corruption.
    It has been suggested that some of the alliances, already confirmed in the group
    stages, may be susceptible to bribes and coercion in order to make them drop out.
    It is rumored that several alliances may be considering this tactic even though
    creating a free group slot would not necessarily guarantee entry. \n\nAs far as
    corruption is concerned, allegations have been made regarding an official announcement
    that was published that said The Red Skull alliance had withdrawn. This prompted
    tournament organizer Nova to publish an embarrassing retraction confirming that
    the statement was incorrect and that they were still competing. \n\nWhenever the
    tournament comes to town GalNet observers are always expecting an exciting show,
    this year with battles in front of the cameras and behind the scenes they will
    not be disappointed. \n\nThe circus is well and truly back in town. \n\n_External
