    Mordu\u2019s Legion Moves Against the Vanguard\nVanguard operatives have been
    deployed across the cluster, disrupting Upwell operations. In response, Mordu\u2019s
    Legion has unleashed an unprecedented number of ground troops. These troops include
    new specialists specifically trained to counter the Vanguard.\n\nThe goal of the
    Vanguard remains unclear, though there are reports of them executing mercenary
    activities on the behalf of unknown third parties. These contracts seem to disrupt
    or exploit Upwell operations. Upwell representatives have accused the Deathless
    Circle of trying to steal proprietary technology. The Circle has repeatedly targeted
    Upwell, not only through the deployment of Vanguard, but also with Mercenary Dens.
    They are also suspected of involvement with the security virus that infected Skyhooks
    earlier this year.\n\nVanguard deployments are also being further weaponized against
    Upwell beyond the conflict ongoing on the ground. Thanks to intel gathered through
    Vanguard deployments, Upwell convoys have been exposed and targeted by capsuleers.
    The convoys in question were not registered with local authorities nor were they
    included in Upwell transport manifests. The consortium has declined to comment
    on why these convoys were unlisted or what their purpose is.\n\nThe Upwell Consortium
    board has, however, issued a statement of total confidence in Mordu\u2019s Legion
    and their counteroffensive. They state that \u201Cwe have no doubt that Muryia
    Mordu and the forces at his command will be able to return Consortium operations
    to normal in a timely fashion.\u201D The statement went on to raise concerns over
    \u201Cthe unchecked insidious influence of the Deathless Circle\u201D and suggested
    that \u201Cthe Consortium has been forced to police its own operations, unsupported
    by supposed law enforcement institutions.\u201D\n\nCONCORD and its representatives
    declined to respond to this comment directly, but their enforcement arm, the DED,
    has told the Scope that they \u201Ctake all criminal activity very seriously,
    but are not accountable for policing regions beyond our jurisdiction. We are not
    able to comment on ongoing operations, but we assure the people of New Eden that
    both CONCORD and the DED are not blind to the threat posed by the Deathless Circle
    and their agents.\u201D\n\n![Anoikis Mapping Project](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/1ow7QjURon3AEeJ85aUsWz/035549a3b4aeaca0b9cebca32b1dfb3d/AnoikisMappingProject.png)\n###
    Anoikis Mapping Project Celebrates 100% Coverage\nThe Anoikis Mapping Project,
    a research endeavor funded by capsuleer Rhysio Typho, has been honored by the
    Federation for its contributions to science and exploration. In November of YC125,
    the corporation became the first institution to simultaneously place an operative
    in every one of the 2,604 systems within the Anoikis wormhole network. \n\nThe
    Anoikis Mapping Project represents the broadest range of cosmic research data
    ever gathered from beyond the limits of New Eden. President Celes Aguard herself
    spoke at the event honoring the corporation, calling the project an \u201Cunparalleled
    achievement,\u201D going on to say that \u201Cthe bold attitude and uncompromised
    vision of these dedicated citizens is an example to us all.\u201D\n\nSince failing
    to occupy a Drifter wormhole system, the Federation has been looking for means
    to catch up with the other three major nations in the field of wormhole research.
    President Aguard herself has come under direct criticism from all sides of the
    political spectrum for this failure, as well as her decision to delay elections
    in order to focus on the now resolved Drifter Crisis.\n\nWhen asked how he felt
    about President Aguard\u2019s perceived failure to secure a place for the Federation
    within the Drifter wormhole systems, Rhysio responded, \u201CIn hard times, difficult
    decisions must be made. I am here to celebrate scientific achievement, not to
    judge whether other decisions would have been better. I am sure the President
    did what she judged to be best for all citizens of the federation.\"\n\n### News
