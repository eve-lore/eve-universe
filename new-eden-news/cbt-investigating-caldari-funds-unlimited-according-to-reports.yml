    Sources within the Caldari Business Tribunal tell the Scope that the CBT has opened
    an investigation into financial malfeasance at Caldari Funds Unlimited, the largest
    independent financial institution in the State. While the exact nature of the
    investigation was not disclosed, the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
    claimed that the investigation was looking at decisions made \"at the highest
    level.\"\n\nThe repercussions of such an investigation could be enormous, according
    to Meungette Dosille, professor of Caldari Studies at the University of Caille.
    \"Caldari Funds Unlimited isn't just any financial institution,\" she explained.
    \"CFU is the largest retirement fund manager in the State, as well as the closest
    thing the Caldari have to a national central bank. If something is rotten there,
    it could damage every one of the Big Eight and cripple the entire State.\"\n\nEven
    if the allegations prove false, according to Dosille, the fallout could end up
    causing significant turmoil within the State. The last time anything like this
    happened was in the Seaguard Financial Incident more than 80 years ago. The Tribunal
    investigation found that a CFU competitor had engineered a propaganda and corporate
    espionage campaign to throw doubt on its stability. The worries triggered riots
    all over the State, and the end result was that the CEP approved \"extreme sanction\"
    against Seaguard Financial. Within a year, the megacorporations had dismantled
    the company, financially and militarily.\n\nCaldari stock markets have already
    begun to feel the effects of the rumors, as financial stocks have fallen nearly
    10% over the last three days. Analysts with the Garoun Investment Bank tell the
    Scope that if speculation is allowed to continue, they could see as much as a
    50% drop from last year's highs."
