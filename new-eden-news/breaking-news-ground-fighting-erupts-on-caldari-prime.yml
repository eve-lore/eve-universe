    partisans and [Caldari](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari) military forces
    have emerged from [Caldari Prime](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Prime).
    According to reports, fights began to break out shortly after 11:30 EST across
    the surface of the planet, as armed Gallente began assaulting Caldari military
    installations.


    The disposition of the Gallente forces is currently unknown as contact with the
    planet has been sporadic since fighting began. Erratic reports have placed them
    either as rebellious residents, remnants of the Federal Marines who have been
    in hiding since the planet was captured, fresh troops deployed covertly by the
    Federation over the previous several weeks, independent mercenaries, or some combination
    of the four. The Federation has not issued any comment to clarify the situation.


    Sami Okuuda, a representative for the [Caldari Navy](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari
    Navy), issued a statement saying, "We are aware of the armed insurrections taking
    place on Caldari Prime. We cannot comment on their nature, but we are confident
    the Caldari armed forces can handle the situation and restore peace in short order."'
