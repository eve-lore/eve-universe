- body: "Saisio, The Forge - This afternoon, a seemingly undamaged Raven-class battleship
    bearing the Lai Dai logo emerged from a wormhole in Saisio near the Sukuuvestaa
    Corporation station in orbit of Moon 20, Saisio VIII. According to sources aboard
    the Sukuuvestaa HQ, station security personally led by Kauliken Uusazoken took
    the derelict ship into custody and towed it to the station after it failed to
    respond to repeated communication attempts. Reports indicate that the ship appeared
    to be adrift without power.\n\nLai Dai CEO Alakoni Ishanoy released a statement
    calling for SuVee to return the battleship and any crew to Lai Dai's possession.
    \"If witness reports are accurate, the Raven matches the description of _LDSS
    Airkio 's Promise_, flagship of our [wormhole expedition](https://www.eveonline.com/article/lai-dai-announces-wormhole-space-expedition)
    which went missing nearly a decade ago. A single Raven retrofitted to function
    as a laboratory hardly constitutes a threat, even to the Peace and Order Unit.\"
    Among the missing were nearly six thousand employees on the research vessel and
    its escorts.\n\nWhile SuVee has declined to release details about the ship or
    potential presence of crew, they did release a brief statement reading in part,
    \"As the vessel in question qualifies as salvage under applicable State law, Sukuuvestaa
    Corporation will retain custody of the vessel and maintain a primary interest
    in its disposition.\"\n\nIn a move emphasizing ongoing political realignments
    in the State, Kaalakiota Corporation, nominally Lai Dai's fellow \"Patriot Bloc\"
    member, quickly released a statement in support of SuVee's position. The move
    by KK suggests Lai Dai would have no easy time of it should they choose to escalate
    the dispute to the Caldari Business Tribunal or Chief Executive Panel.\n\nAdditionally,
    the current summit meeting of the CEP is considering the critical issues of megacorporation
    territorial concessions, corporate security force jurisdiction, and the current
    status of Inner Circle negotiations on the Emergency War Powers Act YC110. In
    this context, Lai Dai making too much of a relatively minor salvage suit would
    risk losing face before the other megacorps.\n\n**In Other News**\n\n  * Floseswin
