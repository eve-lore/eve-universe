    lingering on the fringes of Gallente space.   \n  \nLocal space farers along the
    border regions of the Federation have reported sighting the vessels, which appear
    to be concentrating in several key systems. While the sightings vary in their
    detail, one shocking consistency has emerged in that all reports mention the ships
    bearing the markings of the notorious Serpentis corporation.   \n  \nRumour of
    the sudden increase in Serpentis activity has spread like wildfire across several
    fringe colonies in the immediate vicinity of the reports, leaving an atmosphere
    of hysteria and confusion in its wake. Several cases of public disorder have been
    reported with martial law allegedly being imposed on the six thousand strong inhabitants
    of one colony after law and order descended into anarchy and rioting.   \n  \nThough
    the Serpentis forces are not thought to have been directly involved in any of
    the incidents thus far, the effects of their presence are being felt throughout
    the regions where they have been sighted as fear and apprehension seems to have
    taken a stranglehold on the local populace.   \n  \nSpeaking over an FTL uplink,
    one Gallente citizen expressed his disgust at the hesitance of the Government
    to respond to the incident, stating \u201CThere\u2019s an entire Federal Navy
    detachment just a few systems away, they could be here inside twenty minutes but
    they just sit there and orbit the gates!\u201D he later went on to remark that
    \u201CAfter the theft of the Molyneux and the wave of destruction it left in its
    escape to Serpentis space, President Foiritan vowed to take steps to stop hostile
    forces within our borders. Now that they are here, he does nothing! Just because
    the fringe systems have a low security rating doesn\u2019t make them any less
    a part of the Federation.\u201D   \n  \nWith no clear idea on the evidently sinister
    agenda of the Serpentis forces massing at borders of the Federation; all eyes
    are now firmly fixed on Souro Foiritan as locals nervously await his response
    to this latest threat."
