- body: "The Federal Intelligence Office in a press release today stated that, according
    to an order handed down from Office HQ yesterday, the Federation will start giving
    out cash rewards for information potentially leading to the capture of several
    suspected UDI agents reported to be operating out of Gallente space.   \n  \nAccording
    to the release, any sightings of the following personnel are to be reported immediately
    to FIO Deputy Director Deverin Gonate:   \n  \nGarenis Toleitaane  \nHonadone
    Neartavis  \nKolipon Vaneede  \nJunosana Sameker  \nDeprete Jonara  \nAlionis
    Fylmino  \n  \n  \nThe FIO asks people to also include the name of the system
    the suspect was spotted in, along with the time of encounter, suspect's ship model
    and ship name. Rewards of 500,000 ISK will be handed out to individuals managing
    to give leads through confirmed sightings.   \n  \nThe operatives are believed
    to be armed and highly dangerous. Pilots encountering them are advised to refrain
    from engaging, and encouraged to contact the Federal Intelligence Office as soon
    as possible.   \n  \nThe release, coming only a week after the mysterious killing
    of UDI operative Goran Mitelek in Amarr territory, has prompted widespread speculation
    as to the Federation's intense determination to bring UDI operatives to justice.
    \  \n  \nAccording to one analyst, \"I won't say ulterior motives, but I won't
    promise not to say it at some point in the future.\"   \n  \nResponding to these
    allegations, Thuire Dercoucon, President's Office spokesman, retorted:   \n  \n\"The
    President finds all claims of foul play to be frankly hilarious. The Federation
    is engaged in protecting its assets and its way of life, both of which have come
    directly under attack from these individuals. The Federation wishes it to be known
    that if it is war they want, then it is war they will get.\""
