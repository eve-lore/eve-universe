- body: "The recent turnover of Kaalakiota Corporation to Tibus Heth\u2019s control,
    and his subsequent announcement of the \u201Cquarantine\u201D of Gallente expatriates
    in Caldari space has sparked another wave of protests. \n\nVerin Tarn-Hakatain
    has called for a week long protest at Kaalakiota corporate headquarters in the
    Nonni star system. Although the protesters numbered less than ten at the time
    Interstellar Correspondents arrived in Nonni, they were nonetheless very vocal
    about their feelings. \n\nIn addition to local communication channel broadcasts,
    the protesters also anchored signs near the Kaalakiota station including one that
    stated: \u201C\u2019Guilty until proven innocent\u2019 is not Caldari justice!\u201D
    and another that appeared to read \u201C\u2019We can be united in purpose... but
    we will never, ever be united in hate.\u2019 -Otro Gariushi\u201D \n\nTarn-Hakatain
    stated: _\u201CWhile Tibus Heth's policies are, in my opinion, all for the good
    of the State, I'm worried that he is in danger of damaging some of our most valued
    principles - our honour, our ethics and our moral balance\u201D_. \n\nTalaris
    EveningStar added: _\u201CI hope personally speaking that this protest can give
    Mr Heth an ounce of judgment and restraint. While it may be too late to avoid
    all out war with the Gallente, I implore Mr. Heth to, at the very least, allow
    those Gallente expatriates to be transported to Federation space, if he is not
    willing to release them. These people, despite their Gallente origins are our
    people. They live our way of life. It truly saddens me deeply that we would treat
    our people in this way. Is this after all any better than those who mistreated
    the employees of Caldari Constructions that Mr. Heth battled against?\u201D_\n\nAt
    least one pilot in Nonni had a differing point of view. Joesph Frost responded
    to the protesters: _\u201CThe attack on the Caldari Station is tragic and deserves
    retribution...all Gallente should be purged out of Caldari controlled systems...
    they are a threat to the State\u2019s security. What I don't understand is why
    the Gallente Fleet is conducting \"Exercise Manuevers\" so soon after crashing
    a Capital Ship into a Caldari Station.\u201D_\n\nAll parties agreed that an official
    response from the Federation is long overdue. Tarn-Hakatain believes that the
    Caldari government should: _\u201Cdemand compensation from the Federation\u2026
    ISK to support the grieving families, materials to help rebuild the Ishukone headquarters,
    a formal apology - which they are yet to give - and an outright condemnation of
    Noir's actions\u201D_. Ghost hunter also felt that: _\u201Ca cooperative investigation
    from the Federation into Noir's actions would help ease the tensions between them
    and the State - I find it ... disturbing they have not been forthcoming.\u201D_\n\nAs
    for the future, Anja Lind stated: _\u201CTibus Heth makes me fear for the safety
    of the universe.\u201D_. Talaris EveningStar shared a similar sentiment, _\u201CDark
    times lie ahead. What you witness here today is one of the few last stands against
    the coming storm. And in the end, even if we fail, at least we can say we did
    what we could.\u201D_"
