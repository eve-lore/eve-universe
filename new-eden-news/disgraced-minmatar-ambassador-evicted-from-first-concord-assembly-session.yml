- body: "Yulai - Newly appointed Minmatar Ambassador Keitan Yun was banned from his
    first Assembly appearance following the delivery of his inaugural speech. The
    impassioned sermon was conducted behind a closed door session, during which he
    accused CONCORD of failing to \"conquer the fundamental challenges of universal
    equality and human rights\" and challenged them to explain the \"hypocrisy\" of
    allowing the Amarr Empire to hold a seat on the Assembly. \n\nThe insulted Amarrian
    ambassador responded with a fiery counter of his own, reminding the audience that
    Chamberlain Karsoth has continued the Minmatar goodwill programs enacted by the
    previous two Emperors, and that the woes of the Republic have nothing to do with
    CONCORD or Amarr, but are instead due to the nation's own fragmented nature and
    \"corrupt, spineless leadership\". The angry Assembly moderator apologized to
    the Amarrian ambassador and conceded that Keitan Yun's remarks were inappropriately
    \"combative\". Mr. Yun was then banned for the remainder of session and threatened
    with permanent expulsion if such behavior continued. \n\nNo comment was available
    from Minmatar Republic Prime Minister Karin Midular, who just appointed Mr. Yun
    to the diplomatic position late last week."
