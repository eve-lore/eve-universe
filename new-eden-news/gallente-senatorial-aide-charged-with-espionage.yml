    - Early this morning, members of the Federal Intelligence Office's Special Department
    of Internal Investigations (also known as the Black Eagles) took Weilard Guillaud
    into custody pending charges of espionage. Guillaud, who served as Chief of Staff
    to Senator Julian Hevard, was apprehended at his home, though FIO personnel conducted
    a simultaneous raid of his offices at Hevard's campaign headquarters.\n\nGuillaud
    stands accused of having used his unrestricted access to Senator Hevard's office
    to pass secrets to the Caldari State through an Amarrian intermediary.\n\nIn a
    public statement, Senator Hevard came to the defense of Guillaud, who is currently
    coordinating the Senator's upcoming campaign for re-election. \"This is ridiculous.
    I've known Weilard Guillaud for nearly twenty years, and he's no spy,\" said the
    Senator. Other co-workers had similar opinions.\n\nSaid one, \"His father was
    a war veteran, and anyone who thinks Weilard Guillaud is a Caldari agent is clearly
    mistaken.\"\n\nHevard, a vocal opponent of the policies of Souro Foiritan and
    Mentas Blaque, has even accused the latter of arresting Guillaud on false charges
    as a way to hinder Hevard's re-election bid. For his part, Blaque calls these
    ideas \"preposterous,\" adding that \"it is the duty of the FIO to pursue threats
    to national security regardless of how highly they're positioned. Eturrer taught
    us that.\"\n\nBut Hevard's outcry has joined the voices of a growing number of
    Gallente politicians who feel that Mentas Blaque's dual roles as Head of the Senate
    and head of the FIO's new investigative arm concentrates too much power in the
    hands of one man. Indeed, increasing allegations of FIO harassment of public officials
    has led to the Special Department of Internal Investigations being re-dubbed the
    \"Blaque Eagles\" in Gallente political circles.\n\nThe FIO has as yet refused
    to comment, calling the matter an \"ongoing investigation.\""
