- body: 'YULAI - Listings at the Secure Commerce Commission were updated this week
    to indicate the transfer of three Jovian Directorate registered corporations to
    the Society of Conscious Thought. The Genolution, Impro and X-Sense corporations,
    operating largely in the core empires of New Eden for many decades, have all been
    transferred to the SoCT with apparent effect from YC118.03.09.


    Collectively, the Genolution, Impro and X-Sense corporations have long been major
    players in the cloning, implants, neural boosters and medical equipment markets.
    This transfer appears to have been carried out without the normal issue of notifications
    and only came to light when researchers at the Scope checked the status of the
    SoCT in light of an Inner Circle notice, today, that a major announcement as to
    the status of the Society will be made in the next few days.


    The New Eden diplomatic circuit is rife with speculation following this notice
    but the embassies of the ''Big Four'' empires are remaining tight-lipped and all
    CONCORD sources refuse to comment ahead of the press conference they intend to
    hold early next week. The stealthy transfer of three major Jove corporations to
    SoCT control has however fuelled speculation that the announcement will concern
    not only the SoCT but the current status of the Jovian Directorate and perhaps
    even aspects of the Drifter Crisis.'
