- body: "Muryia Mordu, the venerated leader of Mordu\u2019s Legion, has ordered for
    a full mobilization of the Legion\u2019s forces. According to sources inside the
    Legion Mordu is putting together a task force with strike capabilities, which
    he intends to lead himself. Legionaries everywhere are left bewildered by this
    development as no explanation has followed in the wake of the order. Pilots on
    leave have been recalled to duty and ships in dry-docks hurried back into service.
    \  \n  \nThe biggest employer of the Legion in recent years has been ORE, charging
    the Legion to protect the property of ORE against encroaching piracy at the hands
    of Guardian Angels and others. There is little doubt that this mobilization is
    the result of the stormy meeting Muryia Mordu had with the elusive Orion Mashel
    of ORE. Though the content of that meeting remains a secret still one can easily
    surmise that Mashel put the screws on Mordu, using the strong financial grip ORE
    has on the Legion as leverage to get Mordu to agree on whatever scheme Mashel
    is hatching.   \n  \nUntil now ORE has not been known to dabble in power politics
    or to use undue force, so a strike against a neighbor is thought to be unlikely.
    If an attack is imminent the most likely candidates are the Guardian Angels or
    even the Intaki Syndicate, thought the purpose of such an attack are a complete
    mystery. Until the task force is assembled and on the move it\u2019s anybody\u2019s
    guess what ORE and Mordu\u2019s Legion are up to on the outskirts of civilized
    space."
