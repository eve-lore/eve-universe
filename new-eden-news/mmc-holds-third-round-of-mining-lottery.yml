- body: "In what is expected to be the penultimate round of their lottery, the Minmatar
    Mining Corp held its third session without disturbances earlier this week in the
    Eystur system.   \n  \nAs reported in early August, MMC sponsors a lottery where
    five participants will win a Rupture Class Cruiser each. Every unit of unprocessed
    ore is counted as one ticket, winners to be selected as soon as the 1 million
    units quota is fulfilled. The resources will be destined to the construction of
    infrastructure inside the Minmatar Republic.   \n  \nThe operation\u2019s chief
    Ninmelan Ungur went on the record stating that \u201CMMC found the presence of
    only eight pilots in this third round rather disappointing\u2026 we had thought
    that Minmatar citizens would be more keen to assist in acquiring minerals for
    the Republic, yet although widely announced in local channels most pilots refused
    this opportunity to profit both themselves and our nation.\u201D   \n  \n\u201CAs
    a personal note, not two years ago the opportunity of getting my hands on a cruiser
    of my very own in exchange of just an hour of mining while helping my Republic
    at the same time would have had me answering immediately\u2026 perhaps young pod-pilots
    have things a bit too easy nowadays.\u201D   \n  \nMMC expects to fulfil their
    target quota of 1 million units of scordite by their next event, which they expect
    to organize in two week\u2019s time."
