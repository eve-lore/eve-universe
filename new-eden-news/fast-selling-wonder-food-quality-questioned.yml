- body: "Protein Delicacies, product of the Sukuuvesta Corporation, has taken the
    food market by storm in the last few weeks. This delicious, yet nutritious and
    healthy food has especially made great headways within the Gallente Federation,
    where it has been hailed as the best thing since self-inflated bread. But rumors
    the product is not all as it seems have been persistent ever since it first appeared
    on the market. Some have, for instance, questioned why there is no domestic demand
    within the Caldari State itself for the product - the food is exported as soon
    as it\u2019s ready. Others have criticized the health organizations for approving
    the product so quickly, after testing it for only a few months. The adherents
    of the Protein Delicacies scoff at these unfounded allegations and suggest they
    were started by malicious Gallentean businessmen envious of the success of the
    Delicacies, especially now that attempts by Gallentean companies to imitate the
    product have all ended in spectacular failures."
