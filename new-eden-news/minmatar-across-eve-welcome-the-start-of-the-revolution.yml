    of anti-Amarrian sentiments, as decades of repressed rage are coming to the surface.
    Following the news regarding the slave revolts on Mabnen, and the joyous realization
    that a cure for the dreaded Vitoc treatment has finally been found and realized,
    many Minmatar free citizens have taken to the streets. On Pator, individuals are
    burning effigies of Amarrian slavers.   \n  \nHowever, as the Minmatar people
    rejoice, their tribal leaders have reacted cautiously to the news. Maeletu Shakor
    has appeared in several locally broadcast reports, urging the populace to: \"Be
    joyous and celebrate, but keep in mind that many of our people will suffer at
    the rash release of Insorum by the Blood Raiders. The uprisings will result in
    so many of our brothers and sisters being slaughtered at the hands of the slavers.\"
    \  \n  \nSeveral other public figures have made statements over the past hours,
    many of which rarely speak publicly. One of them is Tenerhaddi Dykon, Krusual
    tribal chieftain: \"The Krusual understand the joy at this news. We are with the
    victims of the oppressive Amarrian beatdown of the Mabnen uprising. We've waited
    too long for this cure, and we urge the Blood Raiders to reconsider their decision
    of abusing this drug for their nefarious purposes. It's too important to waste
    on petty vengeance.\"   \n  \nSources within Parliament claim that PM Midular
    has been in constant contact with tribal representatives, republic diplomats and
    foreign emissaries since news of the rebellion on Mabnen arrived. She has given
    an official statement on the Mabnen revolt, roughly two hours ago: \"Insorum presents
    our people with something we have lacked for too long, a cure for the cruel Vitoc
    treatment. It is a shame that the Blood Raider covenant chose the drug as a method
    of inciting terror in the Amarrian populace. We urge the Covenant to contact us,
    so we can work out a way to treat the people that are in need. We cannot allow
    a symbol of hope to become a symbol of terror.   \n  \nMeanwhile, cries are heard
    from parties springing up across the Republic. \u201CMinmatar everywhere; celebrate!
    Billions of our people now have a chance to live without the need to fuel their
    horrible addiction. They needn't fear the horrifying death any more. To those
    in the position to do so, help refugees to the best of your abilities.\"   \n
    \ \nNot surprisingly, nothing was said about the Amarr's reaction to the incidents
    on Mabnen. Undoubtedly, the Republic wants to wait and see what the future holds
    and if the Covenant makes good on its threats to further destabilize Amarrian
    slave facilities."
