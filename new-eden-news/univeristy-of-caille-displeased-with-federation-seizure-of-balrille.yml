- body: "Sparked by the Federation Navy's lockdown of Creodron operations within the
    Balrille constellation, University of Caille Press Officer Ellyn Enstrom responded
    with shock and outrage. The University has been heavily involved with the day's
    events, convening a meeting of top scientists early this morning in order to determine
    the cause of the \"Seyllin Pulse\", as well as attempting to diagnose and mitigate
    the disastrous occurrences thereafter.  \n  \n\"With the Navy's interdiction of
    CreoDron infrastructure,\" said Enstrom, \"the very foundation of our scientific
    research is threatened. CreoDron was operating as explorers and scientists, and
    if we are not free to pursue those endeavors without fear of government intervention,
    science will falter and fade.\"  \n  \nEnstrom also responded to allegations stating
    that the Federation Navy was reacting against another threat to its citizens.
    \"We understand that it's been a trying and difficult day, but at no point have
    we seen any reports that these spatial anomalies pose any threat to any person
    in New Eden. The Federation Navy now controls not only the data feeds from the
    portal, but those in charge of reading those data feeds. Any data we see now is
    suspect at best.\"  \n  \nEnstrom ended her presentation to the assembled press
    with a short statement on the future of discovery. \"We respect and honor the
    work done by CreoDron and Professor Burreau, as well as those other entities putting
    together expeditions. It would be a shame for their collective bravery, especially
    on a day that has tested all of our mettle, to be lost because of an act of overprotective
    instinct.\""
