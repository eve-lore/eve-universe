- body: "Early morning operations at Hyasyoda's Urlen refinery station came to a brief
    halt this morning as the facility was shaken by several internal explosions. The
    cause of the explosions is unknown at this time. Despite panicked initial reports
    to the contrary, both the Caldari Navy and the State Protectorate both report
    that the incident was not caused by enemy actions, and that the station's superstructure
    and systems security remains unbreached.  \n  \nCompany officials have refused
    to answer questions or even acknowledge the incident. \"Refining operations at
    all Hyasyoda facilities are currently operating within acceptable norms to maximum
    capacity,\" the company said in a prepared statement through Jamille Eron, a staffer
    in Hyasyoda's public relations department. \"No disruption of corporate operations
    has occurred; it is business as usual for the corporation today.\"  \n  \nIn other
    news, Hyasyoda also announced the sudden and immediate resignation of Deputy Vice-President
    of Public Relations Rajateri Zehiman. Mr. Zehiman's resignation comes as a surprise
    to many outside Hyasyoda. Per their employment policies, Hyasyoda has declined
    to comment on Mr. Zehiman's departure."
