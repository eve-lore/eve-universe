    contact with the Minmatar Republic has been lost. Efforts to reach government
    officials have been met with automated responses, and Federation emissaries are
    reporting that foreign offices, including consulates and embassies, have been
    closed without explanation. Further, efforts to contact Prime Minister Karin Midular
    or her spokesman have gone unanswered. She was last seen being hurried away from
    parliament by security guards following her call for new elections. \n\nRepublic
    Fleet Grand Admiral Kasora Neko remains the only government official in regular
    contact with international dignitaries, but refuses to offer any details on the
    present state of the Republic. She warned that the Fleet will \"uphold its mission
    to maintain law and order\" within its territory and that she \"will continue
    to protect Republic borders with vigilance\". \n\nMeanwhile, the Federation Navy
    has issued a travel advisory for all destinations in the Minmatar Republic as
    refugees continue to pour across the border."
