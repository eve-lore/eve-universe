- body: "All the empires that make up the civilized part of space are putting increased
    emphasis on deadspace complexes now that the technology behind keeping them secret
    has been compromised. The empires are keen to keep unwanted parties out of deadspace
    areas within their borders, and the only way to do that is to occupy them for
    themselves. This move comes as no surprise, as it is only a matter of time before
    other factions catch up with the complex technology and start building their own
    complexes in deadspace. It is already rumored that pirate factions have launched
    cleanup operations of their own in deadspace areas, clearing out any rogue drone
    infestations, in preparation for this. Though commendable from the point of view
    of checking any possible rogue drone plagues, many feel that deadspace pirate
    havens are just as bad.   \n  \nDetails are still vague on how exactly the 17
    year old Ladette Russeot managed to break the encryption guarding the warp beacon
    signals used to enter deadspace. The Caldari State has launched an internal investigation
    into the matter, but any findings will most likely be kept under wrap. Especially
    as the Caldari are feeling rather embarrassed that the encryption technology they
    devised and flaunted as being unbreakable was so easily brushed aside, by a teenager
    to boot. However, this is of little interest to the common pilots, all they care
    about is that the efforts of Russeot allow them to experience deadspace for themselves.
    For better or for worse."
