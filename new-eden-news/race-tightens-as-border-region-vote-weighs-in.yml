- body: "According to the latest numbers from the Gallente Electoral Commission, incumbent
    President Souro Foiritan has gained three points on his opponent, Senator Mentas
    Blaque, bringing the race to a close two points. The news comes in the wake of
    a concerted showing of Matari and Intaki immigrants at polls in border regions
    of the Federation.   \n  \nThe cities of Aubruille, Sargai and Sebirouse, the
    three most populous cities of Sinq Laison, a border region of the Federation,
    have seen large rallies of Matari and Intaki voters storming voting locations
    in calculated rushes, events which are widely believed to be orchestrated by several
    nameless grassroots immigrant organizations.   \n  \nFour hours ago Temperance
    Square, the bustling site of Sebirouse\u2019s central voting location, played
    sudden host to a seventeen-hundred person mixed crowd of Matari and Intaki, assembled
    within three minutes from smaller groups in several different parts of the square.
    The silent mob proceeded to the voting station, where every one of them cast their
    vote for incumbent President Foiritan. The same phenomenon was reported in precisely
    the same manner in Abruille, Sargai, and dozens of smaller cities. The proceedings
    were more or less peaceful in all places, with only a few minor incidents of violence
    reported.   \n  \nAnalysis of the past few hours has been rife with speculation
    on the nature of these groups. Many commentators believe them to have been carefully
    trained and controlled, while others believe them to be nothing more than the
    end result of ideological memes spreading rapidly through a threatened subset
    of the population.   \n  \nWhatever their cause, they appear to indicate a trend:
    incumbent President Souro Foiritan now stands only two points behind his opponent,
    Mentas Blaque. The current total tally of polled districts stands at 359 out of
    a total 528."
