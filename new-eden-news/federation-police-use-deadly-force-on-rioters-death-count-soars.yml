- body: "Luminaire \u2013 **Update** \u2013 Raging ethnic violence on Caldari Prime
    took a turn for the worse as Federation police opened fire on rioting Caldari
    expatriates. Although there are conflicting reports about the specific circumstances
    surrounding the incident, reliable sources claim the decision to use force was
    made following the shooting death of a Federation police officer. Camera drones
    on site are recording imagery of groups of young males attacking Federation establishments
    as owners return fire. Municipal police forces are erecting barricades around
    businesses and private property. Although local politicians have appealed for
    calm, the death toll is estimated to be in the hundreds, with at least twice as
    many casualties."
