- body: "Late last night, one of the leading authorities in regenerative genetics,
    Professor Mkauna Nkumi, was found dead in his research facilities in Ferira system.
    \  \n  \nConcord police say that they currently have no leads as to the motive
    of the attack. However, the sheer brutality and utter rage this murder appears
    to have been conducted in, is allowing criminal psychologists to narrow down the
    search considerably. Logs also indicate that the professors clone, which was kept
    in a special facility adjacent to his laboratory, was deactivated mere minutes
    before his death, preventing him from resurrecting.   \n  \nProfessor Nkumi, well
    known for his contributions to the field of regenerative genetics is most famous
    for his work into cloning technology. His methods and discoveries caused an immense
    increase in clone efficiency, helping to bolster public confidence in the technology.
    Lately however he had been coming under fire from several prominent anti-genetics
    groups, who claim that his most recent research into post-mortis regeneration
    breaks all kinds of ethical and legal barriers. Because of this, Concord investigators
    are interviewing several protestors which have been known to commit violent acts
    in the past.   \n  \nNkumi was a very solitary scientist, who always preferred
    working alone. It was this preference of solitude which means that his body was
    not found for over 4 weeks. Even then police were only alerted when the research
    facility technicians noticed an increasingly pungent smell emanating from his
    laboratory.   \n  \nPolice are also on the lookout for the professors\u2019 personal
    ship, which along with a large portion of his departments\u2019 research funds
    has been stolen. Officials are urging anyone with evidence to come forward. In
    a press conference the chief of police in Ferira said, \"What would normally be
    a simple case has been made complicated by the time frame. All normal trails have
    gone cold so we are asking anyone who has any information regarding this incident
    to come forward. All information will be held in the strictest confidence\"."
