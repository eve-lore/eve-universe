    Minmatar capsuleers from the Ushra'Khan alliance broke out last night, as the
    ongoing Kahah Rebellion continues to [provoke strong passions](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/republic-and-federation-condemn-kahah-massacres-threaten-sanctions-or-worse/)
    in the interstellar community. The incident saw a Minmatar militia freighter destroyed
    by the intervention of a Khanid Navy _Aeon_ -class supercarrier, and an apparent
    retaliatory strike on a CONCORD observer vessel by Ushra'Khan capsuleers.\n\nKhanid
    forces were responding to an attempt to land troops on the surface of Kahah III,
    made by Tribal Liberation Force militia led by the capsuleer Armast Darkar. The
    fleet of Ushra'Khan vessels were providing escort and support for Darkar's _Providence_
    -class freighter as militia and mercenary troops attempted landings on Kahah III.
    Also present was Captain Oveg Drust of SARO, operating as an observer on behalf
    of CONCORD's Inner Circle, and a contingent of Amarr loyalist paramilitaries.\n\nThe
    Minmatar landing efforts are reported by numerous sources to have failed badly,
    with a proportion of the \"shuttles\" and \"dropships\" apparently burning up
    due to insufficient adaptation to Kahah III's atmospheric conditions. Other landing
    craft are reported to have been destroyed by Khanid ground forces operating anti-aircraft
    batteries, with others hunted down by Khanid atmospheric fightercraft of the Kahah
    III territorial squadrons. It is also reported that numerous rebels and guerilla
    fighters on the ground were eliminated by units of the notorious 7th Asbara Cyber
    Knights as they attempted to sabotage Khanid ground installations.\n\n![RKN Ironclad

    \ \n_RKN Ironclad Faith at Kahah III (credit: General Stargazer)_\n\nThe _RKN
    Ironclad Faith_ , an _Aeon_ -class commanded by Royal Commodore Arraz Nomarya,
    apparently functioned as the command center for combined ground, air and space
    operations of the Khanid forces responding. Commodore Nomarya issued a brief statement
    for the press:\n\n\"Royal Khanid Navy forces, operating in conjunction with the
    Expeditionary Kahah Pacification Force and Kahah III Territorial Militia, thwarted
    an illegal and incompetent incursion into the airspace of Kahah III. Our loyal
    militia provided anti-aircraft fire, supported by detachments of the 15th Naval
    Aerospace Defence Brigade. Their efforts eliminated the bulk of the threat from
    falling debris as rebel 'dropships' broke up in the atmosphere. The 9th Kahah
    III Territorial Squadron's AC-6L _Simurgh_ fightercraft removed the remainder
    of the minor threats posed by the attempted incursion.\n\n\"Given the illegality
    of the attempt, under the provisions of the Yulai Convention, Accords and SCC
    Independent Planetary Management Act, the _RKN Ironclad Faith_ led a taskforce
    to destroy the rebel freighter that operated as the launching platform for the
    incursion. We were successful, with the aid of loyal Amarr capsuleers, and withdrew
    in good order following completion of operations. The pacification of Kahah continues,
    under the exemplary command of Sardar Marshal Fayez, with only scattered rebel
    resistance on Kahah III remaining to deal with. \"\n\n![Amarr and Minmatar capsuleers

    the attempted landings failed, the Ushra 'Khan forces carried out a successful
    \"suicide attack\" to destroy the _Marshal_ -class battleship commanded by Captain
    Oveg Drust, despite it clearly operating as an observer platform on lawful CONCORD
    duty. Ushra'Khan sources claimed this to be retaliation for \"CONCORD support
    of war crimes in Kahah.\" Captain Drust asserted, for his part, the importance
    of the Yulai Convention and laws pertaining to planetary security.\n\nCapsuleer
    news broadcaster ARC Studio released an edition of its \"The Discourse\" show
    covering the incident and has authorized the Scope to syndicate the [special report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3njTflGMuo).\n\nEvents
    last night followed turmoil in Kahah space the previous day, as alleged \"blood
    cultists\" from the Fweddit capsuleer alliance [executed some two million slaves](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/in-the-skies-of-kahah-a-message-shall-be-sent/117966)
    in the staged immolation of nine _Providence_ -class freighters above Kahah III.
    Roundly condemned by Amarr and Minmatar alike, the massacre has provoked much
    disquiet over the open practice of slave trading through the SCC markets.\n\nThe
    SCC has made no comment on the matter of the slave trade and the official position
    of the Amarr Empire was clarified in a [response to petitions ](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/empress-catiz-i-honors-amarr-loyalist-capsuleer-groups-pie-and-cva-and-responds-to-petitions/)made
    to Empress Catiz I, on the occasion of her recent second jubilee. Sources at CONCORD
    indicate that the attempted breaches of the Yulai Convention and SCC IPM Act have
    caused much concern, and there are discussions at the highest level concerning
    the security of planetary customs offices and industrial colonies allowed to capsuleers
    under the act."
