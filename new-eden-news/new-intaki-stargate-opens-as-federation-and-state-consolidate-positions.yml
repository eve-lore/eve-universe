    Gallente Federation Stargate from Intaki to Amygnon*\n\n### New Stargate from
    Intaki to Amygnon Opens Alongside Federation Navy Station\n\nIntaki, Placid \u2013
    The Gallente Federation has completed construction of a new stargate in the Intaki
    system that connects the [territory newly-liberated from militia warfare](https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/breaking-president-celes-aguard-addresses-federation-on-liberation-of-intaki)
    with the high-security Amygnon system deep in the Gallente region of Verge Vendor.
    The Federation Navy has also completed and opened a new station in orbit of Intaki
    Prime.\n\nTo accompany these changes, the Federation government has formally registered
    a system security status change from 0.1 to 0.2, and formally registered for navigation
    purposes the fifth planet of the system as \"Intaki V (Intaki Prime)\". Federation
    security officials have indicated they intend to continue working to raise the
    security status of the Intaki system and President Celes Aguard's government has
    officially declared that the low security of the Intaki people's home system is
    a \"federal emergency\" that requires continued direct intervention.\n\nIntaki
    autonomy activists and a significant minority of Intaki Assembly members continue
    to protest the ongoing presence of Federation military and security forces in
    the system, and particularly on Intaki Prime. There has been considerable disquiet
    on the planet over the presence of Federation Intelligence Office internal security
    forces and a number of \"counter-terrorism\" and \"anti-sabotage\" operations
    by Federal Marine units.\n\nIntaki and Gallente politicians and protesters in
    the wider Federation also remain vocal in their opposition to the state of emergency
    and military presence in Intaki system, focusing their ire on what they claim
    are breaches of the Federation constitution and treaties with the Intaki. Senator
    Suvio Bellaron, representing the Federal sub-district covering the city of Lenoika
    on Intaki Prime, has continued to be vocal in his opposition to the Intaki system
    policies of President Aguard's administration, though his stance has been met
    with some scepticism due to his history of \"central interventionist\" politics
    in social and economic policy. \n\nSenator Faron Shu, a long-time foe of Bellaron
    representing the Jin-Mei home planet of Chandeille in Lirsautton system, was notably
    acerbic in comments on the apparent shift: \"The whole Federal Senate knows that
    Bellaron is an opportunist whose ambition is only matched by his appetite for
    imposing his world-view on others. We now see clearly that Bellaron is happy to
    stamp his cultural values on anyone who isn't Intaki, but is not so keen when
    it comes to his grip on his political power base on Intaki Prime being threatened
    by the sensible security policy of President Aguard.\"\n\n![calnav stn UM Q7F](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/4PHPMa0AXcu8PQ6sWlUhLM/74b448288b9ea6c57f4516bf6dd1b1fd/calnav_stn_UM_Q7F.png)\n*Above:
    Caldari Navy Anchorage station in orbit of UM-Q7F IX*\n\n### Caldari State Solidifies
    Presence in Syndicate with Three Navy Stations in DS-M4Q Constellation\n\nUM-Q7F,
    Syndicate \u2013 Caldari State forces establishing a new \"protectorate\" in the
    Syndicate constellation of DS-M4Q have completed their major military infrastructure
    construction efforts and opened three Caldari Navy station in the 0EK-NJ, T-LIWS,
    and UM-Q7F systems. Caldari Navy forces have also been enhancing their garrison
    fleet presence and have built up security outposts guarding the approaches to
    the constellation. \n\nThe DS-M4Q constellation was [transferred to Caldari State
    sovereignty](https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/breaking-caldari-state-takes-control-of-syndicate-constellation)
    by the Intaki Syndicate as part of an agreement on mutual defense and security
    co-operation crafted in response to the Federation's intervention in Intaki and
    ten other Placid region systems. Federation authorities have continued to view
    this as an \"internal matter\" for the Intaki Syndicate, although there are reports
    of increased Federal Intelligence and Navy scouting operations in the wider Syndicate
    region.\n\nThe Caldari State has reportedly increased its trading positions with
    the Intaki Syndicate, agreeing a new preferential status for the Intaki Bank and
    giving Intaki Commerce access to certain State markets previously restricted to
    Caldari corporation. It is also reported that the Caldari Navy and Intaki Commerce
    have signed a logistics agreement allowing the Syndicate's commercial arm to ship
    goods via naval jump navigation routes in return for local supply support for
    State operations in DS-M4Q constellation.\n\n![fednav stn intaki prime](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/3wPByVqTsveciQW0KmwLPN/024c589c679117ce8a92596aa3b53860/fednav_stn_intaki_prime.png)\n*Above:
