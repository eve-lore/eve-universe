- body: "A recent meeting between Chemal Tech and Eifyr & Co. officials has raised
    suspicion in the wider interstellar community, sparking renewed concern and inviting
    a fresh round of conspiracy theories about the shady Krusual-backed Eifyr. \n\nThe
    meeting itself appeared innocuous enough on the surface; a small gathering of
    representatives discussing mutually beneficial research and development agreements
    \u2013 the likes of which happen all the time between the Federation and Republic.
    The Krusual tribe however, with its 22% shareholder control in Eifyr & Co. is
    no stranger to speculation, particularly the wild kind and particularly in recent
    months. \n\nOne major factor spurring the most recent bout of rumours has been
    the leak of a coded document belonging to Chemal Tech. The document clearly names
    the Republic Security Services alongside Chemal Tech and the Kalaakiota Corporation.
    Whilst it still has not been deciphered some two months later, the document nevertheless
    has implicated the Minmatar Republic in the recent high-profile defection of one
    of Kalaakiota\u2019s leading researchers Hirento Autinen. \n\nMany have now come
    to draw a link between the document and the most recent meetings, noting the string
    of coincidences. Suspicions were truly ignited however by a bulletin labelled
    \u201CThe Core\u201D, posted on the underground networks by Tekkai Magha, a prominent
    government agitator and notorious conspiracy theorist. Various events trailing
    back over many months were all linked together into one overarching tale of corporate
    and national conspiracy, inciting more widespread suspicion and hysteria. An excerpt
    follows:\n\n_\u201CIt\u2019s been happening for longer, but it starts to look
    really obvious around the time of Kassigainen. We have previously happy workers
    turning on their employers for no apparent reason. Someone has to have planted
    the seeds of discontent. Then, only a little later, who do we have but the RSS
    implicated in the Kalaakiota defection, and who is the majority shareholder of
    the RSS? Now, we have Eifyr. & Co. talking to Chemal Tech, the same Chemal Tech
    that poached one of Kalaakiota\u2019s leading minds. Again, who is the majority
    shareholder in Eifyr? The answer to both questions is the Krusual tribe, they
    have had a controlling hand in two situations now, and they\u2019re only the ones
    we know of. Their reputation is hardly some Matari cultural myth.\u201D_\n\nThe
    different response from involved parties to the bulletin has only further fuelled
    interest and speculation in the meetings. Federation officials claimed the riots
    and defections were \u201Chardly a fire that needed stoking,\u201D and pointed
    to both Autinen\u2019s claims of corporate ruthlessness, and the destroyed Federation
    aid convoy. Caldari State officials simply refused to comment entirely. Most enigmatic
    however were the words of one Krusual tribe official who remarked only that the
    bulletin was \u201Centertaining, but far too short.\u201D\n\nWork continues on
    the coded documents."
