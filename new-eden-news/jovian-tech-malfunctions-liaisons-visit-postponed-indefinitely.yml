    with heads of state over the past hour, explaining what has become of their delegate,
    Misu Banya, who was to have arrived at New Caldari at 12:00 EVT today. Two of
    the four largest empires, Caldari and Amarr, have already issued press releases
    concerning the affair.   \n  \nBaniya, Extra-Racial Liaison for the Jove Directorate,
    was set to meet with several major heads of state and factional representatives
    over the course of only an hour, in order to commemorate the one-year anniversary
    of the Interstellar Services Division\u2019s founding. What happened instead,
    according to Yangin Aortum, Head of Research for Jovian ship-building company
    Shapeset, was that the equipment Banya was to have used for the transportation
    (a \u201CMeta-Molecular Transportation Device\u201D) malfunctioned despite extensive
    testing, splitting the Jovian into tens of thousands of separate pieces, effectively
    scattering him throughout the known universe along with pieces of the Fullerene
    chamber he was encased in. Already several people have reported finding small
    slivers of flesh and bone lying around on the streets, in foot lockers, in hangars,
    and even in overcoat pockets.   \n  \nThe Jove Directorate wished also to \u201Cexpress
    lament\u201D for trying new technology in this public capacity before making absolutely
    sure no errors would present themselves. The Directorate is currently contemplating
    possible means of getting the pieces back, and considering the Jovians\u2019 extreme
    propensity for loyalty to their prized operatives, speculations run rampant that
    eventual black market trafficking in Misu Baniya is a very real possibility.   \n
    \ \nAsked by an Amarr liaison when the Meta-Molecular Transportation Device would
    be finalized and ready to be released upon the world, Aortum replied only with:
    \u201CSoon.\u201D"
