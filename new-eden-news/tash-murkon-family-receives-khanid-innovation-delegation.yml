- body: "Tash-Murkon Prime - Khanid Innovation, the Khanid Kingdom's largest industrial
    corporation, has sent a delegation of executives, engineers and scientists to
    the court of Catiz Tash-Murkon. Arriving today, the delegation is yet more evidence
    of growing ties between the Kingdom and the Tash-Murkon Family, ties already strengthened
    considerably by the Tash-Murkon rescue of several Khanid vessels last month.\n\nThe
    delegation had been planned for the last few weeks, but after the Kador assault
    on Gallente space the company had briefly put those plans on hold, citing security
    concerns. However, court insiders on Khanid Prime have been quoted as saying that
    the sudden and overwhelming response of the Federation to the border incursion
    has made the king much more keen on strengthening ties with his allies, especially
    the Empire, and that those concerns made it unlikely that this meeting was in
    any real danger.  \n  \nThe delegation will be spending some six weeks on Tash-Murkon
    Prime, where they will speak with economic and military advisors to the heir before
    proceeding on to Penirgman, where they will meet with their counterparts in Imperial
    Armaments and the Ishukone Corporation's Amarr subsidiaries. The company is also
    seeking an audience with the Empress's court and the Imperial Navy, but no firm
    plans for such a meeting have yet been announced."
