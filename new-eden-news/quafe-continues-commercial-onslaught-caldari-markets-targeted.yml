- body: "Only two days after sending Amarr traditionalist factions into a blind rage
    with their highly controversial advertisements for the newly announced Quafe Ultra
    soft drink, the Quafe Company has today begun broadcast of a new commercial, this
    one targeted at Caldari markets.  \n  \nThe advertisement depicts the crowded
    interior of a corporation\u2019s boardroom, the marble-and-chrome design closely
    resembling that pioneered by the Sukuuvestaa Corporation and now copied in almost
    every one of the larger boardrooms across the Caldari State. A Caldari man, portrayed
    by a Gallente actor made up to look like a Civire, stands at one end of the conference
    table pontificating loudly about facts and figures. An obviously bored Gallenteen
    businessman attending the meeting pops a can of Quafe Ultra and ends up tap-dancing
    on the table, eventually turning the whole of the board meeting into a raucous
    party.   \n  \nThe commercial\u2019s content has prompted little official backlash
    from the traditionally diplomatically reserved Caldari State, but since its initial
    airing at 10:00 EVT this morning, the SCC\u2019s Department of Commercial Regulation
    has, according to an inside source, been the recipient of a tremendous amount
    of pressure from several Caldari corporations. The source has said that a large
    number of official claims are being filed to the effect that the Quafe Company
    is in direct violation of several SCC-imposed regulations regarding the frequency
    and presence of advertising material, particularly in Caldari-controlled space.
    \  \n  \nOne corporation has been particularly vocal in this regard: representatives
    of Drink Starsi, a steadily growing Caldari soft drink company which has come
    to be known as Quafe\u2019s largest competitor in the Caldari State and some parts
    of the Amarr Empire, have publicly called for the complete removal of all Quafe
    advertising in Caldari-controlled space, citing DED regulations that have allowed
    Quafe a virtual monopoly on jumpgate billboard advertising space as evidence of
    under-handed business practices on the part of the soft drink giant.   \n  \nThe
    Quafe Company has not issued a response to the allegations yet, but SCC spokesmen
    have assured reporters that every claim will be investigated thoroughly in close
    cooperation with DED officials.   \n  \nQuafe Ultra is expected to hit the shelves
    in the next few days."
