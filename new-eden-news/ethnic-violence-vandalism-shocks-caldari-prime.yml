    overnight against Caldari expatriates on Caldari Prime. Security camera footage
    revealed numerous bands of Gallentean vandals engaged in hate crimes ranging from
    the physical assault of ethnic Caldarians to the torching of the last surviving
    Tikiona State archeological site on the planet. \n\nThe flames from the archeological
    site could be seen for miles. \u201CThis is an unspeakable tragedy,\u201D Dr.
    Hans Demato of the Science and Trade Institute proclaimed. \u201CThis place was
    sacred to us! These were our ancestors, the ones who founded the Caldari State!
    Who would do such a thing? Why?\u201D \n\nAnti-Caldari sentiment was especially
    evident at defaced memorials dedicated to Caldarians killed during the Federation
    bombardment of those same locations hundreds of years earlier. \u201CWhere were
    the police?\u201D one terrified expatriate asked. \u201CWe\u2019re supposed to
    be under Federation protection here\u2014how could they let this happen?\u201D
    \n\nMunicipal Federation authorities have released images of the vandals and are
    asking anyone with information to notify authorities immediately, also warning
    that any \u201Cvigilante justice\u201D would be dealt with harshly. With the exception
    of the largest cities of Arcurio and Tovil, Caldarians and Gallenteans live in
    mostly isolated communities, with the former holding \u201Cexpatriate\u201D status
    and permanent work visas permitting them to remain on the planet. All property
    and land titles for Caldari Prime are owed by the Federation government or private
    enterprises."
