- body: "A bloody riot erupted yesterday evening at what was to be a peaceful rally
    in Gelfiven V metropolis Dober Harn. Hundreds of people had gathered at Liorren
    Square, the city\u2019s most populous locale, to protest the Republic Parliament\u2019s
    actions in recent weeks and the rule of Prime Minister Karin Midular.   \n  \nAccording
    to anonymous witnesses police cordoned off the area early on, an act which led
    to \u201Ca growing wave of dissonance\u201D within the assembled crowd. A quarter
    of an hour into the proceedings, a firebomb was lobbed from somewhere in the crowd
    into the line of riot police, leaving two dead and thirteen injured.   \n  \nThe
    police responded by employing stopfoam and sottoblast equipment on the protestors,
    leading to a fracas which lasted over twenty minutes. Seven protestors were killed,
    all of them succumbing to sottoblast-induced brain hemorrhages.   \n  \nThe Bloody
    Hands of Matar, a newly-formed youth rebel group with suspected ties to organized
    militias in various provinces of the Republic, has claimed responsibility for
    the firebombing. On their personal feed, the group claims that they \u201Cmodel
    ourselves on the ideals espoused by our capsuleer kin,\u201D and that they are
    \u201Cdedicated to the overthrow of the current government, be it by word or by
    fist.\u201D   \n  \nThe group\u2019s logo, a bloody fist, closely resembles that
    of notorious Matari capsuleer alliance The Ushra\u2019Khan, one of the organizations
    that has been most vocal in denouncing Midular and her reign. The past week has
    seen a number of protests springing up in all corners of the Republic, most of
    them believed to be inspired by the now-notorious February 12th protest held by
    the Ushra\u2019Khan over Matar, calling for the resignation of Prime Minister
    Karin Midular.   \n  \nThe protest is believed to have set off a wave of anti-governmental
    sentiment. Says Marek Brandeira, leader of The Bloody Hands, \u201CIt didn\u2019t
    really set it off so much as push it forward. I mean, those guys are great and
    all, but there are a lot of people who have been saying these things for years
    now. This government is obviously corrupt and needs to go.\u201D   \n  \n\u201CWe\u2019re
    grateful for the new manpower, though,\u201D he said. \u201CThis has definitely
    helped rally more people to the cause.\u201D"
