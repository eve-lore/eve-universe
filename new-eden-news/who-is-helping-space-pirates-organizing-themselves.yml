- body: "DED is gravely concerned over recent reports describing drastic reorganization
    for many pirate factions in the outer regions. The scale and scope of the changes
    have led many to belief that a hidden party is responsible for them and DED is
    now launching an all out investigation to identify the culprits and urges anyone
    with any information bearing on the matter to come forward.   \n  \nThe command
    structure of many of the most infamous pirate factions, such as the Guristas and
    Sansha\u2019s Nation, has been radically altered and now has more in common with
    regular empire navies. A command hierarchy has been put into place, with added
    responsibility and communications. Pirates are already a considerable nuisance
    for space travelers outside empire space and pilots are cautioned that the pirates
    will likely make their presence felt even more strongly now."
