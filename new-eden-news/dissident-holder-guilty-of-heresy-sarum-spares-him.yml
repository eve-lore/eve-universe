- body: "Amarr \u2013 Today it has been revealed that the outspoken holder, Kerrigan
    Orsha, who disparaged Jamyl Sarums\u2019s imminent rise to power at a business
    conference in Sarum Prime was found guilty of heresy. \n\nKerrigan Orsha unleashed
    a sudden and shocking outburst directed at the gathering soon after the conference
    began in which he declared that Jamyl Sarum was \u2018impure\u2019 and \u2018unworthy
    of the throne to the holy Empire under God\u2019 before almost ranting about her
    cloned status. This threw the conference into complete chaos as Kerrigan Orsha
    was beset by angry holders and business leaders, among which his own son renounced
    him as his father. \n\nKerrigan Orsha was escorted from the disruption by the
    attending Sarum security forces on the Sarum Family station and placed under arrest.
    After an inquisition lasting several days Kerrigan Orsha has reported to have
    repented and throw himself on the mercy of the Inquisition. A sentence of death
    was quickly delivered and to be carried out later today. \n\nHowever, soon after
    the execution sentence was announced Jamyl Sarum herself ordered that his sentence
    be commuted. Unconfirmed reports from within the Emperor Family station in Amarr
    state that Holder Kerrigan Orsha was brought before the soon to be Empress where
    she has offered him a withdrawal from public life to a convent and dedicate his
    life to study of the scriptures. This was conditional that he accepts some measure
    of punishment for his actions in the form of having his seditious speech etched
    onto every part of his skin with a precision micro-laser. Having agreed to this
    term and accepting Sarum\u2019s offer, Kerrigan Orsha was escorted away again.
    \n\nA further decree by Sarum granted clemency to the remaining members of the
    Orsha family, and stated firmly that no harm would come to them or be allowed
    to come to them in relation to Kerrigan Orsha\u2019s actions."
