    the Starkmanir and Nefantar search for tribal leaders to represent them at the
    upcoming tribal assembly, many within the two tribes are expressing worry over
    whether the two tribes will be able to find an equal voice at the table. With
    much smaller populations in the Republic than the other five tribes, they worry
    that they will be simply drowned out.\n\n\"It isn't some sort of conspiracy or
    malice that we suspect,\" said Elettan Skias, a leader among the Starkmanir refugees
    in the Pator system. \"It is only natural though, given our small population,
    that the concerns of the larger tribes will be addressed before ours. Unfortunately,
    that is making it very hard to raise the hopes of my tribe that real progress
    for us will come out of this.\"\n\nSome among the Nefantar tribe, however, seem
    to suspect a more deliberate effort to shut them out of the political process.
    Agrik Tolenni, a Nefantar trader who left a profitable business in the Mandate
    to return to the Republic during the Elder War, told us that he and many other
    leaders of the Nefantar community have been shut out of many parts of the assembly's
    planning process. \"Those of us who came here, most of us gave up everything we
    owned to return to our homeland. Many within the other tribes seem to have forgotten
    that though, and still see us as traitors or worse.\"\n\nSanmatar Shakor has tried
    to allay such fears, declaring that all tribes should have equal say at the assembly.
    As preparations for the assembly continue, however, it remains to be seen whether
    other tribal leaders and members of the bureaucracy will follow his lead."
