    Kaalakiota's corporate currency board meets for the third straight day, rumors
    continue to circulate that the company is considering a significant devaluation
    of their corporate scrip. Sources within the company's central bank say that the
    board is considering this step due to a sudden spike in Kaalakiota scrip-to-ISK
    transfers, which corporate economists are blaming on black market currency exchanges
    in the Intaki Syndicate.\n\nNo megacorporation has considered such a step in nearly
    two decades, since Ishukone took a similar step in YC 93 to mediate an ISK shortage.
    The rumors have only compounded the problem, as many Kaalakiota citizens have
    begun exchanging their scrip for ISK at the bank limit in anticipation of the
    move, further sapping the company's reserves.\n\nSerge LaFleur, an economist at
    the University of Caille, says the move could have far-reaching implications for
    Kaalakiota and the rest of the Caldari economy. \"This is usually seen as a sign
    of desperation, due to the panic it can set off in the general populace,\" he
    explained. \"If Kaalakiota is short enough on ISK that it's considering such a
    move, the worry is always there that it won't be enough, and the company may have
    to turn to Caldari Funds Unlimited for a loan to keep the company from defaulting
    on financial obligations.\""
