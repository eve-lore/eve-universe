- body: 'LUMINAIRE - The Ishukone Corporation has revealed the finalization of talks
    with representatives from Material Acquisiton and the Gallente Senate, with a
    view to returning the city of Arcurio to Caldari administration.


    The city, which was heavily damaged during the siege of Operation Highlander and
    the subsequent destruction of the Leviathan-class Titan _CN Shiigeru,_ remains
    the only one of the three largest cities on Caldari Prime not under Caldari administration.


    Allocated to Material Acquisition during the drafting of the Highlander agreement,
    Arcurio is home to some 97.3 million inhabitants and is still considered the cultural
    and historical capital of the Caldari State despite being deep within Gallente
    territory.


    The announcement has been hailed across the State after several difficult weeks
    for Ishukone ''s leadership under the scrutiny of the Chief Exectutive Panel.
    However, Ishukone administrators on Caldari Prime have played it down, explaining
    that "while the outlook is extremely positive, negotiations to finalize the arrangement
    are still very much underway. The intention was for the agreement to remain confidential
    until finalized, but the precipitate actions of the Chief Executive Panel and
    our competitors over the last several weeks have forced our hand in this delicate
    matter."'
