- body: "Extensive construction and maintenance contracts have been awarded to Roden
    Shipyards by a Gallentean Federation Senate subcommittee in a process that has
    evidently circumvented the usual bidding process. Representatives of rival corporations
    as well as representatives of watchdog organizations are crying foul and calling
    for further investigation. According to some reports, these contracts were \u201Crubber
    stamped\u201D through the bidding process from within Senate oversight committees.
    \n\nThe contracts, valued at a combined 157 billion isk, were awarded to Roden
    Shipyards for the construction of space-faring vessels and support hardware, stargate
    manufacture and maintenance, military and combat-support equipment, and a variety
    of other durable goods equipment, as well as unspecified \u201Csupport and conjunction
    services.\u201D Both goods and the services are to be delivered over the next
    three Yoiul Calendar years. \n\nThe awarding of government contracts as extensive
    and lucrative as the Roden Shipyards contracts usually take months, if not years,
    to work their way through the Gallentean Senate and its various subcommittees.
    The pace and apparent secrecy with which the Roden contract was approved has raised
    suspicions among many that these contracts may have been awarded to Roden, primarily
    by the influential Senate Trans-stellar Security and Safety Commission, in exchange
    for future political favors. The STSSC is a Gallentean Federal body tasked with
    overseeing budget concerns and expenditures for the intersystem travel infrastructure
    and those assets of the Federal Navy dedicated to domestic security. It is no
    secret that many in the senate oppose President Foiritan\u2019s budget proposals,
    specifically the large expenditures slated for unspecified future research and
    construction, and the STSSC contain some of the President\u2019s most vocal opponents.
    \n\nThough rumors continue to circulate about possible misdeeds in awarding the
    Roden contracts, statements issued from the STSSC and other Senate subcommittees
    responsible for approving the contracts in question claim recent \u201Crapid action
    initiatives\u201D adopted by the Senate allow them to act on budgetary items with
    unprecedented speed. Even critics of the Roden Shipyards contract are at a loss
    when asked about specific examples of wrongdoing, largely because of the confidentiality
    under which such budgetary decisions are now made. \n\nMuch is still unknown about
    the manner and methods used to approve the contract, owing to recent legislation
    relating to the Crielere Agreement. Due to recent non-disclosure and copyright
    protection regulations ratified in the wake of the Crielere Agreement, the exact
    workings of the various Senate subcommittees have fallen behind a veil of secrecy\u2014secrecy
    the President says is misplaced. \n\nIn a statement from his office in Ladistier,
    President Souro Foiritan said, \u201CThe Crielere Agreement, though critical to
    the ongoing successes of our collaboration with our friends in the Caldari State,
    was never intended to safeguard domestic policy. My esteemed colleagues in the
    Senate are not serving the public trust by obscuring a process which should be
    open for review. Gallenteans everywhere deserve to know how their government is
    serving them.\u201D \n\nPresident Foiritan\u2019s esteemed colleagues do not agree.
    \u201CThe President calling for openness in expenditure disclosure is like a pickpocket
    calling for the police. Foiritan has been looting the public coffers for whatever
    new technology presents itself, even untested experimental equipment with no practical
    application, for quite some time now. Is he jealous that the Senate is using the
    Gallentean people\u2019s money to serve the Gallentean people directly and immediately?
    If that\u2019s the case, perhaps he should review the section of his proposed
    budget dealing with research and development.\u201D"
