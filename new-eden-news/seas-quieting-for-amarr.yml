    inauguration, the average Amarrian's life has been full of whispered half-truths
    and uneasy speculation. Rumors have run rampant from corner to corner of the vast
    empire, the normally subdued arenas of Amarr political debate have been close
    to erupting in violence on several occasions, and the Amarrian stock market has
    had to face record instability.  \n  \n\"It's really a matter of the Empire's
    self-image, more than anything else,\" remarks Gundar Mirosabin, political analyst
    and respected author of bestseller _Power's Personality_. \"That 'strong, benevolent
    overseer' image they had of themselves under Heideran's rule does seem, quite
    naturally, to be receding, and the empire is struggling to find its new face under
    a new leader.\"  \n  \nIn the past few days, however, many signs have pointed
    to increased stability, leading some to suggest that the Empire is beginning to
    adjust to its new ruler and the changes his regime will bring. The stock market
    is restabilizing, political debates have lost much of their earlier venom, and
    according to Amarr Certified News several decrees instated by the new Emperor
    have met with resounding approval among all five ruling houses. At a rare press
    conference held last Monday Hrollulf Sodalrat, Chief Coordinator of Public Relations
    for the Court Chamberlain\u2019s Office, stated that \"The Empire currently sits
    at the dawn of great prosperity for all of its loyal subjects, and His Holiness
    the Emperor will see us to our glorious zenith.\""
