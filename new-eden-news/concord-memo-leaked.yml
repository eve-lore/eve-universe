- body: "An internal memo from CONCORD has been leaked which contains details of the
    alleged assassins of the late Doriam II.   \n  \nThe memorandum provided by a
    source who wishes to remain anonymous states, \u201CWe have evidence that points
    towards an individual from the Royal Khanid Navy being responsible for the assassination\u201D.
    The memo goes on to detail that, \u201CPreparations are underway for insertion
    of an under-cover agent into the Royal Khanid Navy to substantiate the claims
    and gather further evidence\u201D. Strangely enough the memorandum does not include
    any relevant evidence to back up the claims made.   \n  \nAmarr citizens have
    taken the news with a renewed anger at the assassination with many demanding an
    official statement from Meor Varuna, others wish a more direct response \u2013
    calling for the Amarr Navy to respond en masse.   \n  \nNeither CONCORD nor Acting
    Regent Chamberlin Karsoth would confirm or deny the authenticity of the memorandum
    at this time.   \n  \nIt will certainly be an interesting time for interstellar
    politics if the Dark Amarr are proven to be behind the assassination of the late
    Doriam II."
