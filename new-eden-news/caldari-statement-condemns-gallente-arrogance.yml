- body: "New Caldari \u2013 Speaking at a much-anticipated press conference today,
    a spokesman presented an official statement on behalf of the Caldari State in
    response to the recent findings concerning the [leaked Code Aria Inquiry report](
    http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=1808&tid=4). \n\nAs expected,
    the statement expressed the Caldari State\u2019s condemnation of the actions of
    the Inner Circle and the veil of secrecy surrounding CONCORD's activities in relation
    to the Code Aria Inquiry.  \n\u201CThe Inner Circle bypassed a critical diplomatic
    process when planning and executing the expeditions into the infested regions.
    The four empires were denied their voice and, as a result, significant resources
    and manpower were devoted to a dangerous mission without our consent. Ultimately
    these resources and men have now been lost - squandered, in fact - on a doomed
    and fruitless campaign. Furthermore, the security of our own jump gate network
    has been placed at risk, as critical details of the methods used to reactivate
    the Infested Region gates were withheld from us.\u201D \n\nThe statement continued
    with an expression of the State's anger at the deeper origins of the rogue drone
    threat and, pointing the finger squarely at the Gallente Federation, it stated
    the following.  \n\u201CThe sheer arrogance of the Gallente Federation and their
    leading corporations has brought about the steady escalation of the rogue drone
    menace over the last twenty-three years. Their mishandled attempt to expand their
    domain, and their subsequent refusal to reveal the true nature of what happened
    when they sealed the gates behind them has threatened us all.\u201D This is only
    the latest of several recent clashes between the Caldari State and CONCORD, and
    no doubt the sour taste of the Secure Commerce Commission's investigation into
    the [Itsukame Corporation]( http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=1663&tid=6)
    was still lingering when the Caldari State prepared this latest statement. \n\nIn
    closing the spokesman for the Caldari State made assurances that the Caldari jump
    gate network\u2019s security will be fully investigated."
