    - [The Bloody Hands of Matar](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Bloody_Hands_of_Matar),
    one of the most notorious terrorist organizations in New Eden, has come forward
    to claim responsibility for the massive explosion on a Ministry of War station
    at Pashanai III earlier today which claimed the lives of just under 5600 people
    and destroyed several billion ISK's worth of infrastructure.\n\nIn a prepared
    video statement released to several media outlets simultaneously, an unidentified
    man with a black cloth across his face speaks in a distorted voice, explaining
    intricate technical details of the operation that experts have now confirmed indicate
    a reliable level of involvement. The man then proceeds to direct scathing political
    rhetoric toward the Empire and the Ammatar Mandate, starkly berating them for
    their \"centuries of unlawful subjugation and violence.\"\n\nThe Minmatar Republic
    has moved swiftly to denounce the attack. In a nationally broadcast statement
    just minutes ago, Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor expressed his condolences to to the
    innocent people of Amarr, caught up in this brutal attack unawares, and pledged
    to assist with relief efforts in any measure the Empire requested.\n\nThe attack
    represents by orders of magnitude the biggest act of terrorism ever perpetrated
    by the Bloody Hands of Matar. The organization has kept largely out of the limelight
    since assassinating an Ammatar consulate ambassador just under three years ago.
    Their numbers, resources and the extent of their operational capacity are unknown
    at this point."
