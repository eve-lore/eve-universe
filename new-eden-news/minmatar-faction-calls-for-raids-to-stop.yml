- body: "Tenerhaddi Dykon, head of the Krusual Tribe, issued the following statement
    just minutes after the identity of the new Amarr Emperor, Doriam Kor-Azor, was
    announced. \"I call upon Doriam Kor-Azor to put a stop to the Amarr raids upon
    our outlying systems. We Minmatar can no longer stand passive as our homes are
    destroyed, our families murdered, and our kin are again bound by the cruel yoke
    of slavery. Never again I say! We live for our freedom, and we are willing to
    die for our freedom!\"   \n  \nThis marks his sharpest departure to date from
    the policies set forth by Republic Prime Minister Karin Midular. As recently reported,
    the Krusual Tribal Leader has been lobbying heavily to unseat PM Midular for her
    failed efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the border disputes. As clashes
    have sharply increased in their severity and brutality, often backed by Sarum
    family sympathizers, the public outrage has reached a fever pitch.   \n  \nMinmatar
    Prime Minister Karin Midular has called for an emergency Parliamentary meeting,
    to be held in two days. Details of the agenda are unavailable at this time, but
    it is expected that the new Amarr Emperor will be the prime subject for their
    deliberations."
