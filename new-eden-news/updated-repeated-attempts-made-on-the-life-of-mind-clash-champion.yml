- body: "LUMINAIRE. Already rising tensions between Caldari Steel and Roden Shipyards
    approached a critical point last Thursday as two separate attempts were made on
    the life of Mind Clash Champion Joelyn Donalokos, whose saving grace was a fully
    upgraded clone. After surviving the attacks, Donalokos managed to reach his destination
    of Caldari Prime, where he stated he would continue despite the events, and defend
    his title in this year\u2019s tournament. \n\nIt is understood that the corporation
    Raddick Explorations was responsible for the initial attack on the champion in
    the system of Luminaire, resulting in the destruction of both Joelyn\u2019s ship
    and those of his security escort. Citing their distrust in a tournament they see
    as corrupted, they found themselves in an escalating war of words with Joelyn
    and his team that eventually broke out into open conflict. \u201CLet\u2019s be
    honest here, 'Champion' is a very presumptuous title,\u201D stated the founder
    of Raddick Explorations, Tobias Raddick. \u201CWe received reliable information
    that the Mind Clash tournaments are more than just rigged...they\u2019re essentially
    staged.\u201D\n\nOnly moments after the encounter with Raddick Explorations, it
    is believed a group now identified as \u201CArising Liberation\u201D, a collective
    of Ultra-Nationalist Roden Shipyards employees, were responsible for the destruction
    of Joelyn\u2019s capsule. Carrying a payload of explosives, a cruiser-class vessel
    was able to approach Donalokos\u2019 capsule surreptitiously as he made his way
    to docking range in a nearby station. The detonation destroyed both the ship carrying
    it and Joelyn\u2019s capsule, activating his clone in a nearby facility. Eyewitnesses
    in the station reported a \u201Cmassive ripple of light\u201D as the cruiser detonated
    its payload, which also damaged the outer structures of the station. No other
    people are reported to have been injured or killed in the blast.\n\n\u201CI never
    thought the threats were for real,\u201D Joelyn responded afterwards. \u201CI
    really didn\u2019t think anyone would actually try to kill me. I\u2019ve had these
    kind of threats many times before, but someone actually acting on them\u2026that
    I didn\u2019t expect.\u201D When asked if the incident would affect his performance
    in the tournament the shaken Champion responded without his usual poise: \u201CI
    don\u2019t know. As I said, this is the first time\u2026I have to admit it\u2019s
    upset me greatly. However, I am confident enough that I can deal with this\u2026I
    hope.\u201D\n\nHolding a hastily assembled press conference outside the Caldari
    Steel offices in Abagawa, spokesman Matoh Kairatoh was furious when news reached
    him of the attack. \u201CI knew this would happen, and I knew they would not leave
    us alone. I warned our people it would and they accused me of making trouble and
    spreading propaganda! Well I hope everyone\u2019s eyes are open now!\u201D Mr
    Kairatoh further explained he had anticipated the attack and personally arranged
    for the escort. \u201CI don\u2019t think I need explain how valuable Joelyn is
    to us and indeed, the general community. We have invested a lot into this tournament
    and we take no chances when it comes to the security of our athletes.\u201D\n\nMr
    Kairatoh demanded a formal explanation from Roden Shipyards, and pushed for a
    full investigation into the matter given that Roden employees were directly involved
    in the attack. The company's recent outspoken nature about the venue of the tournament
    has only fuelled speculation about their level of involvement. The only official
    response from Roden so far was from spokesman Orvecel Raoulin, who confirmed that
    those responsible were indeed fellow employees. He added that immediate action
    had been taken to expel them from the corporation and turn them over to the proper
    authorities. However, it seems that shortly after the attack the Arising Liberation
    members went into hiding. Their location remains unknown at this point. \n\nDespite
    their presence nearby at the time of the attacks and their involvement in the
    destruction of Joelyn\u2019s vessel, Raddick Explorations employees have denied
    any links to Arising Liberation, with Tobias stating: \u201CAs it should be, where
    skill, rather than money, determines the winner, RDEX has no significant objection.\u201D
    His views are in stark contrast to the Arising Liberation, whose actions and words
    have expressed a \u201Cprofound disgust\u201D with the notion of a Gallente-Intaki
    being paraded as a moneymaking pet of the State Mega Corporations. Many have been
    shocked at the apparently widespread anti-tournament sentiments broadcast, even
    more so at the lengths some have gone to in expressing their discontent. \n\n*****Breaking
    News*****\n\nShortly after the publishing of this article, the Interstellar Correspondents
    were contacted by Mr Donalokos\u2019 management who wished to state that the Champion\u2019s
    capsule in fact, survived the blast. In a speedily written transmission to IC
    Headquarters in Polaris, his lead manager stated: \u201CJoelyn has been terribly
    shaken by all of this, I don\u2019t think he realised he did not make it clear
    that his pod survived. We assumed the Interstellar Correspondents were aware of
    this. We are happy to say that he made it to the docking ports mere seconds before
    the explosion.\u201D Attached logs from Mr Donalokos\u2019 cloning facility have
    confirmed this as fact and the IC wishes to apologize for the miscommunication.
    \n\nOnly moments after the IC received the first transmission, it was followed
    by another. Originating from an untraceable source, the anonymous message is believed
    to be from the ringleader of the Arising Liberation group. It read: \u201CWe would
    like to thank Raddick Explorations for their most recent help. They have proven
    to be a good friend to us in the past but today they have shown themselves to
    be much more than that, we now consider them an ally. The promised payment for
    their help this time will be double the usual. We also understand the little weasel
    escaped this time. Rest assured, we will not be thrown off our path. The purification
    of the Gallente race is a duty we will not disregard. The corrupt best watch their
    backs, we will return to finish the job.\u201D\n\nA return reply could not be
    sent, nor could any Raddick Explorations employees be reached for further comment
    at this time."
