    of contention still the infamous Crielere Project and the funds President Foiritan
    is hoping to secure that will facilitate it's conclusion. \n\nDuring a two hour
    mediacast the President, The Leader of the Senature and the Chief Justice of the
    Supreme Court were all given free reign to debate the issue in front of a 'live'
    studio audience. Chaired by the popular right-wing media host Jarveshier Melanger
    it was no surprise that the debate quickly descended into farce; the Senator and
    President both tangling through past issues in order to score cheap political
    points over the other. So desperate was the verbal melee that at one stage both
    parties were blaming the Caldari-Gallente War on the other, a war that for the
    benefit of our younger readers, ended nearly a century ago. \n\nWhilst political
    horns are locked tight, there are signs this morning that public opinion is starting
    to fall behind the President in the wake of news that one of the victims of last
    week's Cistuvaert V shuttle collision near the CASS station was a cousin of Jon-Rah
    Purple (real name Marionette Gahor), the lead singer of the insanely-popular music
    group PodKill. \n\nThe singer's cousin Kharin Gahor, who perished in the incident
    along with two other Gallente students, has been named by the Presidential Advisor
    for Science as one of a 'handful of junior technicians who have been working on
    the Crielere Project since its inception'. A statement subsequently released by
    Gahor's family read: 'Kharin was promising scientist and a loyal Gallentean, respected
    and loved by his family, friends and colleagues. For two years he had been working
    on the Crielere Project and it would a waste of his short life if his work had
    been in vain.' \n\nIn light of this tragic but otherwise insignificant development
    support for the President has risen an average of four points across the board,
    whilst amongst the 12-28 age group support has rocketed by nearly eighteen points.
    Despite opposition charges that the President is cashing in on this tragedy to
    further his own agenda, it would appear going by similar swings in public mood
    in the past that President Foiritan may eventually get his way after all."
