- body: "This morning, Duvolle Labs convened a press conference at their corporate
    headquarters to present further technological details regarding the revolutionary
    hardpoint systems demonstrated several days ago. Also on the order of business
    was announcing the completion of the bidding for the technology system from the
    three other empire research and development corporations. The highest bidding
    corporations are the Carthum Conglomerate, Lai Dai Corporation, and Boundless
    Creation. \n\nHaving secured their partnerships, Duvolle Laboratories proceeded
    to deliver more details on the technology behind the hardpoint systems that have
    left media technological analysts drooling the last few days. \"Simply put,\"
    began Marreti Forbes, spokesman for Duvolle Laboratories, \"we have made one hardpoint
    into two.\" Met with curious expressions, he continued in depth to explain how
    a dual-hardpoint system and an advanced power management system have been employed
    in conjunction with updated control software. Components from a secondary hardpoint
    installed onto the weapon mounts are used to regulate the power routing, tracking
    and targeting software as well as other subsystems, allowing for increased damage
    power. The development of this system was, however, not without much trial and
    error as the development proceeded over the course of this year. \"The software
    was the final piece of the puzzle.\" He added proudly. \"All of our hardware modifications
    had run into a dead end, as the power levels obtained from the hardware output
    fell way short of our expectations. One of our inspired software technicians solved
    the issue.\" Technical details aside, the software has been adapted using code
    from the Siege Module used on Dreadnoughts. While the hardware systems are customised
    on a Dreadnought to work the more advanced features of the Siege Module, Duvolle
    Labs have been able to acquire a similar increase in damage on the weapon systems
    of their prototype Battleships. \n\nWhen asked about why the various prototypes
    appear to have only four weapons points, Mr Forbes explained that they require
    substantially more power to run. \"We could only do so much to boost the power
    core of every prototype ship we applied the technology to. If we had applied this
    to more hardpoints then there would be no power left for the modules being fitted
    to the ship.\" \n\nVisibly eager to promote the more positive aspects of the ship,
    he reminded everyone that four weapons now have the power output of eight weapons
    so nothing has been sacrificed. \"The more valuable aspect of this technology
    means that a reduction in crew stations required for weapons subsystem controls,
    as well as the advanced automation used in the regulation of the complex hardpoint
    technology, has freed interior space in the ship. With some bulkhead modification
    to the primary skeleton of the ship, we see a significant increase in cargo space.
    Not only that, but you still have several remaining standard hardpoints for utility
    modules.\" A further highlight of the new ship class is an increase in combat
    longevity, attributed in the main to the decrease in weapon hardpoints and consequent
    reduction in ammunition consumption. \n\nAsking about the advanced automation
    in the hardpoint systems by a representative from the Caldari Advanced Weapons
    Portfolio technology journal, Mr Forbes relayed these further details. \"The dual-hardpoint
    weapon mounts operate on a very complex power management system.\" He elaborated.
    \"The usual approach of pod pilot technology, coupled with a manual crew has always
    proven itself to be eminently proficient at managing multiple ship systems. However,
    this system as it stands places much more workload on that working relationship,
    especially in the heat of an engagement. Given this, it was considered a much
    safer approach to develop highly advanced automated regulation for the new systems,
    assisting with pilot and crew management.\" \n\nAs the conference drew to a close,
    the partner corporations refused to give details on the specific features of their
    finished ships until development was completed. It is expected that the remaining
    work on these projects will last no more than one or two weeks."
