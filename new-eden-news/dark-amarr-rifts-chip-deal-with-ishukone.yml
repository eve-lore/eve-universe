- body: "In the wake of rising prices for the Transcranial Microcontrollers due to
    increased demand from the Gallente Federation, the Dark Amarrians have decided
    to rift the deal they made with the Ishukone Corporation, the manufacturers of
    the chips. A spokesman from the Khanid Kingdom explained that the price of the
    chips was now so high that it counteracted the benefits the chips provided in
    economical terms. The kingdom thus saw no reason to continue buying them. The
    spokesman said that those chips already purchased and currently en route to the
    kingdom would be implanted, and those slaves already implanted would stay that
    way, but otherwise the old slave policy would be reinstated.   \n  \nIshukone
    has released a statement following these news, stating they are sorry to lose
    such a valued customer as the kingdom, but insisting that the laws of the market
    should prevail and that the price should be dictated by those willing to pay the
    most for them, Federal citizens in this case.   \n  \nThe news have received a
    mixed response, many are rejoicing that the 'barbaric implantation of mind control
    devices' is being terminated, while others lament that the Dark Amarrians are
    taking up the old, brutal, ways of slavery, with no thought given to a more humane
    treatment of slaves."
