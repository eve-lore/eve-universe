- body: "The Col system, sources have recently revealed, was the site for an eventful
    skirmish between a small force of Amarr Navy ships, led by Rezini Hazaza, and
    a Khanid patrol. The Khanid patrol was led by Daro Hanau, a pilot serving with
    the Dark Amarr for almost three years.   \n  \nBoth sides of the scuffle rallied
    support from the pod pilots in system, but to the great surprise of the Amarr
    Navy ships that were left badly damaged after the fight, these pilots turned their
    guns on the Navy amid shouts of \"They're all Amarr to me!\" and \"They dropping
    anything valuable?\".   \n  \nHanau and many of the Khanid apparently survived
    the battle with their ships intact, but the large majority of the Amarr Navy force
    was destroyed. Hazaza lost both his ship and his escape pod. The Khanid patrol
    denied Hazaza's claims about the Emperor's assassination, proclaiming \"CONCORD
    has filled your head with lies!\", but it seems that the Empire has already passed
    judgement on Dark Amarr.   \n  \nThe tension has been building since the galaxy
    learned about the CONCORD investigation into Khanid's connection with Doriam II's
    assassination and many fear that this is just a taster of more terrible conflict
    to come. Chamberlain Karsoth refused to comment on the issue, neither refuting
    nor supporting the claims that Hazaza was acting independently in Col."
