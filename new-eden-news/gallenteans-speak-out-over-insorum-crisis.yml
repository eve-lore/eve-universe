- body: "The recent actions and future promises of the Blood Raider Covenant have
    been the subject of much discussion over these past days. As always, the Gallente
    people are among the first to have their opinions publicly acknowledged.   \n
    \ \nMaude Sharis, Cultural Liaison of Caille University, and an avid supporter
    of the Minmatar Republic had the following to say:   \n  \n\"I am pleased that
    a significant battle is being fought in the war against slavery, but this bold
    move by the Blood Raiders has truly forced the Empire into a corner. I fear the
    worst consequences of this 'Insorum Imbroglio' have yet to take effect.\"   \n
    \ \nThe scientific community in general seems excited that this new drug appears
    be as effective as the late Professor Hnolku claimed it to be, though many researchers
    are crestfallen; the miracle cure they've been searching for all their lives lies
    just beyond their grasp.  \n  \nThe Senate, and the individual presidential candidates
    showed uncharacteristic concurrence, each pleading with the Blood Raiders to share
    a sample of Insorzapine bisulfate, thus allowing it to be used for the common
    good. Antoine Burleaux, a well known Gallente businessman and senior Senate member
    has commented in relation to the incident, \"Factions like the Blood Raider Covenant
    operate in the lawless expanse of the non-central regions, and have no understanding
    of civil concepts like subtlety, equality and rationality. They're barbarians,
    pure and simple. Omir Sarikusa needs to consider the countless lives his crusade
    is costing humanity as a whole.\"   \n  \nWhile refusing to make an official comment
    on the issue, President Foiritan has shown his anxiety by ordering a mass mobilization
    of Federal Navy forces, in preperation for the inevitable political fallout which
    will result from this crisis."
