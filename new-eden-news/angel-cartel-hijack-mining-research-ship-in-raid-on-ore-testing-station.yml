- body: "4C-B7X, Outer Ring \u2013 In a brutal raid on an Outer Ring Excavations (ORE)
    research and testing facility in 4C-B7X, Angel Cartel hijackers seized a *Rorqual*-class
    mining vessel outfitted with experimental materials compression technology last
    night, according to reports from sources within the Upwell Consortium. It is understood
    that a large number of ORE scientists and engineers working on the specially-equipped
    Rorqual were kidnapped in the course of the hijacking by heavily-armed Cartel
    forces.\n\n![Rorqual Hijack](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/6YfdK3R3iNaMuybM5VIA8c/aa6398936f16ed738c46eb023045ee98/rorqual.png)
    *Above: ORE Rorqual Carrying Out Tests in Space*\n\nWhile reports remain somewhat
    confused, sources within the ORE-led Upwell Consortium regard it as a \"near certainty\"
    that the attackers were members of the Angel Cartel, and in particular are associated
    with a notorious unit known as \"Commando Zohar\" rumored to report directly to
    the Cartel's leadership, the Dominations. If these claims are borne out it would
    indicate that the Angel Cartel's highest echelons authorized a direct assault
    on one of ORE's most critical research facilities and industrial development programs.\n\nThe
    *Rorqual*-class *ORS Esperance* is said to have been a key element in ORE's development
    and testing of new materials compression technology for use in the vital space
    mining and resource harvesting sector. The means by which a heavily-armed unit
    of Cartel commandos boarded and seized such a key asset as the *Esperance* are
    currently unclear but one source suggested that another ORE ship was used to infiltrate
    the hidden testing yard.\n\n![Materials Compressor](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/48wGJ75D7AyLpNafvUIuAa/1a17305deb466b6247b888ceb896e9cc/Compressor.png)
    *Above: ORE Materials Compressor Project Test*\n\nThough clearly shocked and stunned
    by these events, ORE representatives have assured all partners that the organization
    has moved swiftly to secure their remaining facilities with the assistance of
    the Upwell Consortium's Department of Friendship and Mutual Assistance, together
    with Mordu's Legion space security forces. Director Lars en Ramon emphasized that
    Upwell's security organization and Mordu's Legion would \"remain on high alert
    for as long as is needed to resolve this situation and defend the interests of
    our member organizations.\"\n\nORE's CEO Afait Assette has authorized a reward
    of 1bn ISK for the safe return of each of the kidnapped ORE research staff, to
    be handled by market brokers at ORE's primary stations in Outer Ring, and a program
    of rewards for stolen information recovered and turned into ORE's loyalty store
    facilities. ORE founder and Upwell Consortium Chairman Yani Sar Arteu is being
    kept informed of developments while on a rare trip to the Amarr Empire for discussions
    on industrial and trade policy with Royal Heir Hamideh Kador.\n\n![Angel Raid](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/4cfDcH9KlmKrDBc9wdbP0m/63cb18877952299db20de0d1b9e45b7d/AngelsFlyFromBowhead.png)
    *Above: Alleged Angel Cartel Raiding Party Cargo Shuttles*\n\nCONCORD sources
    have expressed disquiet at this escalation by the Angel Cartel and indicated that
    DED units have been alerted to watch for any sign of the stolen vessel, but have
    noted the incident took place \"far beyond the jurisdiction of DED police forces.\"
    EDENCOM forces have also been placed on raised alert status as a precautionary
    measure.\n\nThe apparent Angel Cartel raid on an ORE research and testing facility
    took place on the eve of the annual \"Guardians Gala\" gathering of Cartel and
    Serpentis Corporation members to co-ordinate their ongoing alliance and celebrate
    their criminal gains over the past year. \n\n![Angels Assault](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/2EEBIHU8R0zpwkGpyqi7Aw/b75e56901456843d5a428f9b9b5eba7d/Angels.png)
    *Above: Alleged Angel Cartel \"Commando Zohar\" Members Assault ORE Facility*\n\nThe
    Serpentis Corporation has made no comment on the reports despite its long-held
    position that ORE was \"illegally taken over by Yani Sar Arteu using market manipulation
    and renegade mercenaries\" [in YC117](VfSixNFeedD3BJrQyrvNQ). The views of the
    Serpentis Corporation on the ORE founder's recovery of his corporation from an
    organization widely regarded as a criminal enterprise are generally considered
    eccentric and lacking any basis in interstellar law. \n\n### In Other News\n\n-
