- body: 'X-70MU -- The Sisters of Eve released a statement today condemning the manner
    in which the Gallente Federation executed Admiral Anvent Eturrer, calling it "barbaric
    and inhumane," and advising the President and Senate to ban any further uses of
    this particular method of execution.


    The statement alleges that "this reprehensible display plays to the basest instincts
    in humanity -- the lust for blood -- at a time when such passions will likely
    only fuel more bloodshed of the kind we have seen over the last several months."
    It continued on, saying that "the President and the Senate should immediately
    ban any further use in order to show their commitment to basic human rights."


    The Federation government has given no official response to the Sisters of Eve
    statement, but many Gallente citizens defended Eturrer''s death by immolation
    on the streets of Gallente Prime today. "Nobody knows how many people died because
    of that bastard," said a Gallente youth at a pro-war rally today, celebrating
    the execution. "There''s a special place in hell for that kind of traitor, and
    any kind of execution was too good for the likes of him." His sentiments were
    echoed by many in the thousands-strong crowd.


    Others, however, have expressed worry over the President''s direction. "My great-grandfather
    served against the Caldari in the war," said shopkeeper Irine Patrone, who was
    watching the rally from her door. "He said there were times when he was so angry
    after Nouvelle Rouvenor he was frightened by himself. I had the same feeling when
    I saw the execution."'
