- body: "**Gallente Prime** \u2013 In the wake of the recent tragedy that fell on
    the Ishukone station in Malkalen, pod pilots throughout New Eden have been voicing
    their opinions of the disaster. Many have been hoping for a peaceful resolution
    to the current crisis, but there are pod pilots calling this attack callous opportunism
    and have vowed to strike back.\n\nDays before the atrocity in Malkalen, Mernor
    Akat had been the organiser of a protest to be held in orbit around Gallente Prime
    in support of the anti-violence movement. The event unfortunately _\u201Cnever
    materialised\u201D_ according to Mernor, with the reason being put down to pilots
    being in a state of shock over the disaster. \n\nWhile considering the situation
    that has unfolded, he still believes that the protest would have been worthwhile
    had pilots shown up. He did express some concern that the heightened tensions
    may have lead to trouble: _\u201Cit probably would have lead to a verbal fight
    between the Gallente and Caldari\u201D._\n\nMernor himself hopes that peace will
    dominate, and is not happy with the inflammatory rhetoric he has heard from some
    Caldari pilots even before the Federation has made any official statements. When
    asked about the potential for war, he commented: _\u201CWar never helps anyone
    and seeing as I\u2019m a miner rather than a combat pilot it won't benefit me
    much. If the Caldari really want a war than I\u2019d do what had to be done, not
    saying I\u2019d like it though.\u201D_\n\nDespite the animosity from some quarters,
    others that wish to maintain calm in these troubling times are not being dissuaded.
    A Gallentean pod pilot by the name of Theo Samaritan, who participated in the
    relief effort, has written a statement asking for calm on GalNet:\n\n_\u201CWe
    as the Elite have banded together despite our racial and cultural difference to
    help those who need it. Gallente, Caldari, Minmatar and the Amarr working together.
    So please, do not descend into war. Do not allow today to cause a conflict that
    could well last more than a decade.\u201D_\n\nA Caldari pilot with a less accommodating
    view is Kosh Ohura: _\u201CWe today mourn for our lost friends, our children,
    and our parents. This is a day of grief for us, but soon will come the days of
    revenge. Beware my friend, for grief will soon be upon you.\"_"
