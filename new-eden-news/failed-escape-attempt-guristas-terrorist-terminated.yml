- body: "THE FORGE. In a failed attempt to escape CONCORD custody, the well-know Gurista
    terrorist Bleak Scarab was hunted down and his pod eliminated in Obe earlier this
    week.   \n  \nAccording to witnesses, Bleak Scarab was able to break free from
    the CONCORD interrogation facilities in Tennen. How her escape was possible and
    how was Ms. Scarab able to seize the Guristas heavy assault cruiser in which she
    left the system is still not clear.   \n  \n\"It is so far obvious that [Ms. Scarab]
    received outside help\", granted Lt. Jeman Khegbakish, CONCORD Internal Security
    deputy for The Forge, \"although it is not clear how. According to our ongoing
    investigation at least one other Guristas operative was present in the system
    at the time, yet we are still unable to determine how [the Guristas] were in possession
    of the coordinates of [Ms] Scarab or how CONCORD premises were infiltrated.\"
    \  \n  \nAn ad-hoc hunting party was rallied by Commander Plaver and Lt Temasi
    of CONCORD Special Forces with outstanding success: at least nine freelance pod-pilots
    were recruited for the effort in a matter of minutes. \"I was amazed by the quick
    response from the freelance community\" admitted Cmdr Plaver \"and their effort
    to maintain law and order is greatly appreciated.\"   \n  \nThe fugitive was followed
    to the Obe system where at least another Guristas heavy assault cruiser was present.
    According to Cmdr Plaver: \"We managed to corner them and the use of lethal force
    was authorized bringing down both hostile vessels. The fugitive\u2019s pod was
    eliminated; her accomplice was able to crawl to 0.0 space, where I have no authorization
    to follow.\"   \n  \nCONCORD has neither confirmed nor denied knowing the location
    of Ms. Scarab clone, or whether or not one even exists."
