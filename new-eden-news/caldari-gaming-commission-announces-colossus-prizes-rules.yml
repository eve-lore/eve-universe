- body: "The Caldari Gaming Commission earlier today gave a long-awaited announcement
    about the prizes to be awarded in this Sunday's COLOSSUS race event finals, in
    addition to publishing a full set of rules for the contest.   \n  \nFollowing
    in the Mikranian tradition of gaming philosophy so frequently favored by the Caldari
    over the last century, the Commission has decided to award separate prizes for
    the team victory and for the individual victory, in order to further stimulate
    the tension between loyalty to the team and advancement for the individual, a
    theme much recurrent in Caldari literature and entertainment.   \n  \nAs stated
    in the Commission's announcement, each member of the winning team will receive
    a Caldari Navy Issue Raven battleship, fully kitted out with specially augmented
    Caldari Navy modules. The net worth of such a vessel is estimated to come somewhere
    within the vicinity of three to four billion ISK.   \n  \nThe individual coming
    in third place will receive a Caldari Navy Hookbill, the specialized patrol craft
    of the Caldari Navy, while the second place winner will get a Navy-issue Caracal
    cruiser. Both vessels will, like the Ravens, be fully fitted with modules tweaked
    by the Navy's engineers.   \n  \nWhat has garnered the greatest attention, however,
    is the individual first prize award: a capsule-fitted Rattlesnake battleship,
    famously designed by Korako \"The Rabbit\" Kosakami and one of only a few such
    vessels currently known to exist. According to the Gaming Commission, the ship
    was confiscated by the Caldari Navy after a Navy raid on a Gurista deadspace complex
    last month killed its owner, high-ranking Gurista terrorist Mourani Tremane. The
    vessel was subsequently donated to the Commission by the Navy for use as a prize.
    \  \n  \nBetting for the final race, meanwhile, is breaking records even within
    the Caldari State. Exact figures vary, but according to estimates something in
    the vicinity of three hundred billion ISK total is being bet on contestants and
    teams.   \n  \nThe final is set to go ahead at 22:00 EVT this Sunday."
