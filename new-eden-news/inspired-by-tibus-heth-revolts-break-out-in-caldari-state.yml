- body: "The Citadel \u2013 With the exception of Ishukone-controlled territories,
    reports of civil disobedience and open revolts against mega-corporate establishments
    are erupting across the Caldari State following the violence at the Caldari Constructions
    Armor Forge facility on Piak III. Roving bands of youths, inspired by the \u201Cheroic\u201D
    actions of Tibus Heth, are targeting symbols of corporate affluence, damaging
    or destroying the property even as local police forces bear down on them. Blatant
    acts of workforce recalcitrance have been reported at numerous production facilities,
    an unheard of occurrence in the Caldari State. Thus far, the mega-corporations
    are countering the revolts cautiously, wary of following Kaalakiota\u2019s example.
    Despite the measured response, hundreds of arrests have been reported so far as
    efforts to contain the uprising continue.   \n  \n  \n[Archive and Comments \xBB](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=762568)"
