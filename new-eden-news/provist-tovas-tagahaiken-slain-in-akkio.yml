- body: '_Akkio_ \- Provist commander Tovas Tagahaiken was slain after a sustained
    firefight in Akkio earlier today. Tagahaiken, one of the Provist militants who
    had stolen a number of Caldari Navy capital ships, was found in orbit of the third
    planet in the solar system. Flying a Chimera-class carrier, he was escorted by
    a trio of stolen Caldari Navy Ravens. Despite a strong resistance from the Provist
    forces, they were eventually destroyed.


    CONCORD records show that 815 pilots were involved in the combat, which lasted
    just over an hour, though it is not clear if everyone was fighting against the
    Provists. Sources indicate at least some number of capsuleers assisted the Provists
    with remote repairing, though it is unclear if this was done with serious intent
    to save them.


    The final blow on the carrier was recorded by DeviLee, Lejandra Sikestor dealt
    the most damage, and Gorski Car slew the capsule. The Caldari Navy is still awaiting
    retrieval of the corpse of Tagahaiken and an analysis of the kill reports to determine
    who will receive the remaining bounties.'
