- body: "With confirmation from the Jovian government that they will indeed try to
    collect as many parts of the unfortunate liaison Misu Banyia in order to revive
    him, the four empires are poised to enter a bidding war over who can collect the
    most parts. Starting tomorrow, the empires will start buying back selective body
    parts on the market. Due to the massive logistics involved they will only buy
    in bulk, meaning they will only do business for one thousand units or more at
    a time.   \n  \nAs gruesome as this spectacle promises to be, it will no doubt
    attract a huge amount of attention from every corner of the world. Not only because
    of the money involved, but because people are curious to see in what way the Jovians
    will reward the empire that collects the most body parts. There have even been
    rumors that the Jovians will reward those pilots or corporations most prominent
    in the collection process, though this has not been officially confirmed.   \n
    \ \nThe Jovians are still close-mouthed about what went wrong with the teleportation
    device that resulted in the sad demise of Banyia. What little they have revealed
    suggest that the failure was human rather technological in nature, strengthening
    the rumors suggesting that foul play was involved. Nevertheless, the Jovians are
    preparing to conduct further tests on their new device, though one can only hope
    the results will be less dramatic in the future."
