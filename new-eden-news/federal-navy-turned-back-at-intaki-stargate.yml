- body: 'Intaki - The Federal Navy relief force assigned to re-establish control of
    the Intaki system was denied access to the Intaki stargate in Agoze earlier today.
    Representatives of the Intaki System Command reportedly informed Admiral Gouenette,
    who is commanding the force, that the Navy had no jurisdiction in Intaki, and
    that their presence was "neither required nor welcomed."


    After the liberation of Intaki and other systems by Federal Defence Union pilots
    last week, the Federation Navy rapidly mobilized units to systematically restore
    military command to the affected areas. However, Intaki leadership has rejected
    the protection that the navy offered to provide, preferring instead to rely on
    their newfound Caldari associates.


    The future of Intaki has been a subject of much speculation since the arrival
    of Ishukone and Mordu''s Legion vessels several months ago. While many citizens
    have assumed that the liberation of the system would see a return to the previous
    status quo, signatories to the Federal Charter retain the legal right to determine
    various aspects of the Assembly of their original territories. This includes the
    "Shipping and Security" franchise, which regulates commercial shipping and which
    is traditionally assigned to FedMart and the Federal Navy and Customs.


    Sources within the Intaki Assembly assert that the deal with Ishukone and Mordu''s
    Legion was made in good faith and in the interests of the Intaki people. On condition
    of anonymity, a senior official said, "The Ishukone Agreement represented, and
    continues to represent, the best option for the long-term safety and security
    of our society." Federal officials have refused to comment on what they describe
    as "an internal Intaki matter."'
