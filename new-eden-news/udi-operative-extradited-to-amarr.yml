- body: "This just in: according to confirmed eyewitness sightings, alleged UDI terrorist
    Goran Mitelek was late last night escorted from Federation Navy HQ in Algogille
    to an undisclosed location in Amarr space.   \n  \nThe extradition comes hard
    on the heels of two weeks' worth of tooth-and-nail debates within Gallente government,
    where Federation President Foiritan has, with unflagging consistency, made his
    wishes to hang on to the prisoner abundantly clear. Representatives from the Office
    of the President were not available at time of going to press, but the general
    expectation is that the President will not take the news lightly.   \n  \nMitelek,
    who up until yesterday afternoon had been held in captivity at one of the Federal
    Intelligence Office complexes in the Essence region, was reportedly transferred
    to Algogille on direct orders from the Senate. Following a brief period of interrogation,
    the prisoner was then escorted by Navy personnel off the premises and into a transport,
    which took him to Amarr territory.   \n  \nPolling on the subject over the past
    two weeks has revealed that a vast majority of the Gallente public are opposed
    to seeing Mitelek extradited. According to an impromptu poll conducted moments
    before going to press, roughly eighty-seven percent of those polled replied that
    they wanted to see the Ni-Kunni brought to justice by Gallente tribunal, while
    only seven percent wanted to see him given to the Amarr.   \n  \nMore on this
    development as it unfolds."
