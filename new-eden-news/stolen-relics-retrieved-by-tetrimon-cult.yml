- body: "A large scale battle between Followers of the Order of St. Tetrimon and Blood
    Raider pirates has occurred this weekend in the Genesis region to retrieve religious
    items. \n\nEscorted by members of the Aegis Militia and Verisum Family, the Tetrimon
    followers \u2013 who were identified as Grand Master Horm and Helmut Orren \u2013
    clashed with the Blood Raiders in the Access solar system; allegedly in a bid
    to secure religious artifacts which the Blood Raiders had plundered from an ancient
    Amarrian temple site in the region. \n\nThe battle raged for over two hours and
    saw several heavily armed Blood Raiders battleships face off against the fifty
    vessel pro-Tetrimon fleet, which included an Archon class carrier piloted by Mirial
    of the Aegis Militia. Grand Master Horm was reported to have petitioned the Blood
    Raider \u2018relic bearer\u2019 Heear Ko'lm to release the artifacts into his
    care during the lengthy battle and was refused several times. \n\nKo'lm was eventually
    forced to jettison half of the artifacts after the destruction of his escort,
    but refused to release the rest. For his \u2018insolence\u2019 the Blood Raider
    was slain and Grand Master Horm ordered his corpse to be retrieved and displayed
    as a heretic in the Tetrimon \u2018Hall of the Damned\u2019 as proof that the
    Order of St. Tetrimon would \u201Cnever allow followers of Sani Sabik to thrive.\u201D
    Though the Aegis Militia and Verisum Family incurred heavy losses during the battle,
    all of the artifacts were reported to have been recovered undamaged and safely
    returned to the religious order. \n\nOver the last few months the Order of St.
    Tetrimon has repeatedly been sighted in the Genesis region, apparently searching
    for the temple of 'God\u2019s Assuring Whisper' which was thought to have housed
    the relics they sought. Only when a coded Blood Raider transmission was intercepted
    by the Order, it became clear that the Blood Raiders had found the temple first
    and taken the relics. At this time it is not known what significance the artifacts
    hold for the Blood Raider covenant."
