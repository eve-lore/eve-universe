    _-_ The Caldari Providence Directorate held a press conference today in an effort
    to allay fears about its inquiry into the [Crielere Project](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Crielere).
    The inquiry has drawn criticism from members of the public following the detainment
    of several individuals.\n\nThe total number of citizens questioned in the inquiry
    is unknown thus far, although a CPD spokesman described the inquiry as \"comprehensive,
    concentrated and complete.\" Former employees on the project, including scientists,
    laboratory technicians, engineers, and administration staff have been called on
    to provide witness statements.\n\nAccording to Metsama Ovai, the CPD spokesperson
    for this project,  \"These citizens are not interned. In a few cases, we have
    given accommodation to some citizens while we conclude our enquiries. A few key
    witnesses have volunteered to stay on station.\"\n\nPlaying down allegations that
    this investigation was an inquisition to root out opponents of Heth, the spokesman
    concluded, \"The inquiry is not about who is pro-Heth and who is anti-Heth. It
    is about finding out the truth about the Crielere Project. If you have nothing
    to hide, you have nothing to fear.\""
