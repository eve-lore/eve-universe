    converts to the Amarrian faith have become increasingly vocal about their fears
    and grievances in the days since the murder of Abel Jarek, leader of the Salvation
    Crusade, by unknown attackers in the religious township he established near ancestral
    Krusual lands on Matar. Following the killing, the Minmatar Republic has promised
    a swift investigation and asserted that \"those responsible for the murder of
    Abel Jarek will be brought to justice.\"\n\nHowever, sources within law enforcement
    agencies on Matar privately say that it is highly unlikely the perpetrators will
    ever be identified. Even though Chief Tenerhaddi Dykon has appealed to the Krusual
    clans of the Tronhadar region, his aides have signalled that he does not expect
    them to give up those responsible. Hardline Krusual clan leaders regard the late
    Abel Jarek as an 'outcast' and thus undeserving of the standards of Minmatar justice.\n\nWhile
    members of the Salvation Crusade were highly-visible, the majority of Minmatar
    followers of the Amarrian religion have sought to remain unobtrusive and keep
    their faith a private matter. Abel Jarek was a controversial figure even among
    Minmatar converts, many believing him too confrontational in his approach, but
    his death serves as a vivid and disturbing reminder of the dangers they face for
    their beliefs. The concern felt by many converts has found expression in particular
    among those Nefantar and Starkmanir refugees who, despite all, hold to the Amarrian
    faith. Converts within those tribes are said by informed observers to be pressing
    their claims for representation and complicating the ongoing processes of selecting
    the Nefantar and Starkmanir chiefs."
