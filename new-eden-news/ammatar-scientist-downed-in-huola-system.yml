- body: 'Dresen Karnell, an Ammatar scientist loyal to the Amarr Empire, was attempting
    to flee capture in the Minmatar Republic and return to the Amarr Empire when his
    craft was attacked and shot down in the Huola system.


    Prior to the Minmatar Invasion, Karnell served aboard an Ammatar Navy vessel conducting
    experiments of high importance to the Amarr Empire. During the invasion his crew
    mutinied, forcing the scientist to disguise himself as a sympathizer in order
    to evade imprisonment. A day ago, he commandeered a shuttle and attempted a return
    to the Empire.


    However, while traveling through Huola, Karnell''s ship was attacked by unknown
    hostiles. With his vessel heavily damaged, he was forced to make an emergency
    landing on a moon in system. 24th Crusade commanders have confirmed they received
    a distress call from the missing scientist only hours ago.


    Rescue operations for Karnell are currently impossible while the Minmatar Republic
    retains space superiority in Huola. The moon Karnell landed on is habitable, yet
    inhospitable. Current estimates of his supplies suggest he can remain at his crash
    site for one to two weeks before he runs out of food and water.


    The rescue of Dresen Karnell has been designated as a high priority task for the
    24th Crusade. Militia command has recommended that current resources be diverted
    towards the recapture of Huola from Minmatar Republic occupancy as soon as possible.'
