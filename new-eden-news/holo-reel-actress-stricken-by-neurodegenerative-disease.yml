- body: "Luminaire - A representative for Kaisa Anneli, long-time performer on Gallente
    stage and screen, announced today that the actress is suffering from a form of
    terminal neurodegenerative disease. \n\nAnneli, 63, began her career as a bit
    player in the minor theaters of the homeworld in 65 YC, but soon her tireless
    work-ethic won her progressively larger and larger roles. Making the transition
    to holo-reel acting in her late twenties, Anneli became best known as a character
    actress with a talent for supporting performances in both drama and comedies.
    \n\nAt her retirement from acting in 95 YC, Anneli had accumulated full credits
    in 57 productions and numerous credits for smaller roles \u2013 though she was
    never given the opportunity to take a lead role in any production. \n\nThough
    never considered a great star during her career, the past decade has seen Anneli
    lend her familiar face and name to various causes and lobby groups \u2013 achieving
    a significant degree of notoriety in philanthropic circles across the Federation.
    \n\nAnneli's representative declined to discuss specifics of the actress' condition,
    saying only the condition is degenerative and the prognosis is for a steep decline
    in function over the next year or two."
