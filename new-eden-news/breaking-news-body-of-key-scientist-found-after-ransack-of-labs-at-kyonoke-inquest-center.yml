- body: 'POSTOUVIN - Security has been tightened at the Kyonoke Inquest Center this
    morning, after a senior member of the Society of Conscious Thought''s research
    team was found dead in one of two laboratories that appear to have been ransacked
    over the course of the night.


    The discovery of the body of the unidentified science team member comes alongside
    the ransacking of two key virology research labs which were thought to be holding
    data on the original source of the Kyonoke Plague outbreak on board the RP4 Facility.
    Initial reports suggest that the member of the science team met with foul play.


    Dr. Cador Veranne, Kyonoke Inquest Research & Development Director, urged for
    calm at a briefing this morning during a briefing session with the science teams
    on board the Keepstar class citadel serving as the base of operations for the
    inquest.


    At this stage, little is known about the motivations of the assailants, or the
    extent of the damage. The Scope will continue to report on major events at the
    Inquest Center as they occur.'
