    for their \"selfless and intrepid will to locate Dr. Tukoss\" and in particular
    the \"outstanding piloting skills of Captain Lucas Raholan, who discovered the
    remains of the late Dr. Tukoss in J174618.\"\n\nShe then went on to request that
    any capsuleers who may have collected biomass from the site hand samples off to
    the Directive Enforcement Department to allow genetic confirmation of identity
    for Dr. Tukoss, in order to bring the case to a close.\n\nIn closing the statement,
    Director Vesren declined to comment or give updates on the situation with The
    Scope and Eifyr and Co, after Eifyr Chief Executive Stawitard Hagirat gave testimony
    before the Inner Circle on May 20th.\n\nWhen questioned regarding the status of
    the cloning contract of Dr. Tukoss, the Directive Enforcement Department also
    declined to comment, simply adding that Eifyr and Co are cooperating fully with
    all aspects of the ongoing investigation."
