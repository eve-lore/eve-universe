- body: 'ERAM - Karin Midular is to undergo emergency brain surgery in an attempt
    to save her life, the Sebiestor Tribe reported today. The Tribal Chief, who has
    been in a coma since her shooting on April 11th, has been undergoing a number
    of radical treatments aimed at repairing the extensive brain damage she suffered.


    According to the report, doctors attempted an aggressive cellular regeneration
    regimen directly on Midular''s brain cells, in an effort to regrow the damaged
    tissue. However, because of a variety of factors including rapid death of cells
    and the lack of healthy ones, much of the regrown tissue has become cancerous.
    Doctors ceased the treatment in hope the tumors would naturally shrink, but they
    continue to grow, putting pressure on Midular''s remaining healthy lobes.


    Doctors are hopeful that emergency surgery to remove the tumors will allow them
    to attempt a different form of cellular regeneration that may have more positive
    results.'
