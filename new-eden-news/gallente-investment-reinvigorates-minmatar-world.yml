    space, has fallen on hard times recently. Minmatar Mining Corporation put significant
    investment into the planet when it was establishing itself in the system shortly
    after the Minmatar won their independence. As a result, Avenod VI became a primary
    staging point for the construction of their stations in the system. Service industries
    on the planet, which was primarily a Sebiestor stronghold, experienced a boom
    thanks to the thousands of construction workers, starship crews, and other support
    personnel who spent their time there. \n\nUnfortunately, the Republic's worsening
    economy has taken its toll on Avenod VI. In the last decade, Minmatar Mining has
    cut their operations in the system by 40%, leaving many on the planet out of work
    and the once thriving service sector fighting over an increasingly small market.
    Unemployment on the planet is nearly three times the Republic average, and recent
    years have seen a rise in crime, drug use, and other social ills symptomatic of
    a planet in decline. Efforts by the Sebiestor tribe and the Republic government
    to remedy the problem have met with failure, largely due to lack of funds and
    interference from the Angel and Serpentis cartels, who have become entrenched
    on the planet. \n\nHowever, last year, Transstellar Shipping announced an expansion
    of its storage and routing center in the system, and a number of smaller Gallente
    corporations, including Quafe subsidiary Quality Agroproducts and CreoDron subsidiary
    Applied Automation, have bought up previously abandoned properties and started
    a number of new industries on the planet. New corporate farms and factories have
    provided a wealth of new jobs and vocational training. According to the man responsible
    for attracting most of this new investment, Gallente entrepreneur Jean Ogorard,
    the Republic presents unique opportunities for the Federation corporations.\n\n\u201CWhen
    I came to Avenod three years ago as a consultant for Transstellar Shipping, I
    was surprised to see so many people and buildings simply sitting idle and empty.
    With so many Gallente corporations looking to expand right now, it seemed silly
    to let this go to waste, especially with Sinq Laison only a jump away.\u201D \n\nThough
    progress is still slow, and the economic situation in the system is far from perfect,
    locals have noticed a distinct change on the planet thanks to the injection of
    funds and jobs. \u201CI've been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy for four years
    now,\u201D said Heskidi Allsvert, the owner of a small restaurant in one of the
    capital city's poorest districts. \u201CSince Applied Automation bought the factory
    down the street though, I've seen more customers every day than I used to see
    in a week sometimes.\u201D Food prices, she says, have dropped this year as well,
    as the planet's growing agricultural sector has reduced the need for imports.
    \u201CI had to double my staff just to handle all the new business.\u201D \n\nAllsvert's
    success is better than most, but Sebiestor tribe authorities on the planet report
    that unemployment has nearly halved over the last year, and crime is down thanks
    to the planet's improving job market and a renewed effort by Republic law enforcement
    in the system to crack down on the Angel Cartel. \u201CWe're not out of the woods
    yet,\u201D said one Sebiestor tribe aide, \u201Cbut we've been able to hang on
    to the coattails of the Gallente boom here, and it's made a big difference.\u201D"
