    spacelanes, the Sisters of EVE splinter group 'Pharos of Thera' has been in exclusive
    contact with the Scope's Galactic Hour with Ret Gloriaxx.\n\nSpeaking to Ret Gloriaxx,
    Pharos of Thera spokesperson Jora Alexis claimed that a covert unit of CONCORD's
    SARO \"Black Ops division\" orchestrated a complex plan to entice Drifters into
    a situation where \"advanced anti-Drifter counter-measures could be deployed.\"\n\n\"The
    story that this was a simple timebase measuring mission is just a cover for the
    real plan involving covert assets from SARO and probably even Algintal Core, who
    after all were also there in force,\" said Jora Alexis.\n\n \"Ever since the disappearance
    of Taya Akira during this Rogue Swarm Alert, we've been seeing even more signs
    of experimental operations carried out by the DED and especially the SARO,\" said
    Alexis. The former Sisters of EVE scientist Taya Akira is the presumed leader
    of Pharos of Thera, while the Special Affairs for Regulations & Order (SARO) unit
    is known to be the DED's elite operators group.\n\nJora Alexis claims that SARO
    has expanded over the last ten years into a covert intelligence and \"black ops\"
    section within CONCORD. As the Pharos of Thera spokesperson put it: \"They specialize
    in developing advanced weapons from ancient technology, eliminating AI researchers
    and sabotaging scientific enquiry that might threaten CONCORD's world order. We're
    certain they are behind the disappearance of Taya Akira.\"\n\nWhen pressed, Jora
    Alexis could offer no evidence to back up the Pharos of Thera group's claims.
    A DED official described the claims as \"conspiracy theory ravings not worth the
    time of any professional journalist.\" CONCORD Aerospace, Project Discovery and
    Algintal Core all declined to comment on the matter. Needless to say, the Galactic
    Hour with Ret Gloriaxx will continue to pursue any leads related to this story.\n\nMeanwhile,
    the DED has declared an end to its Rogue Swarm Alert after over five weeks of
    counter-rogue drone operations by both CONCORD and capsuleer freelancers working
    to fulfil contracts issued through the Agency. The DED admitted that they have
    \"noted the unusual and increased length of time of this Rogue Swarm outbreak\"
    but they reassure the public that \"research and development of new methods of
    anticipating, and countering, rogue swarms is ongoing.\""
