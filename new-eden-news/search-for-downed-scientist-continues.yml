- body: 'The search for the Ammatar scientist downed on a habitable moon in Huola
    continues. The search team believes it is on the right track, as it recently discovered
    a day-old camp site they believe was used by Karnell. The camp site shows indications
    that he managed to procure a small amount of water and has a fair supply of food
    rations.


    A search of the area produced tracks that the rescue team is continuing to follow.
    Orbital scans revealed a small lake twenty kilometers north of the camp site.
    The rescue team believes Karnell may be heading there.


    Further updates will be made as they become available.'
