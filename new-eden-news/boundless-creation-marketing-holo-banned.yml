    A review panel at the Republic Justice Department has ordered a ban on the latest
    marketing holoreel produced by Boundless Creation after fierce opposition from
    a Minmatar-Gallente based pressure group. The group, named \"Reconcile,\" is a
    pro-peace movement seeking to move the major governments of New Eden toward a
    peaceful end to current hostilities.\n\nReconcile filed a petition with the Republic
    Justice Department several days ago, stating that the upcoming Boundless Creation
    marketing holoreel was \"needlessly antagonistic and totally lacking in any measure
    of class.\"\n\nThe disputed holoreel contains publically sourced footage of the
    recent capture of the last Curatores Veritatis Alliance outpost in AY-YCU in the
    Providence region, where an all-Minmatar starship taskforce was assembled by the
    alliances Against ALL Authorities and Ushra'Khan, as well as several other capsuleer
    organizations.\n\nA Reconcile spokesman stated the following after the hearing
    today: \"We are very happy with the ruling and feel that something worthwhile
    has been achieved here today. As our first major move into any high-profile lobbying,
    we are understandably excited with the results, and the prospects of future success.\""
