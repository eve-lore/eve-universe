- body: "Caldari Prime \u2013 The Federation Navy has abandoned its attempts to break
    the Caldari Navy\u2019s blockade in Luminaire and is reportedly deploying \"all
    spaceborne military assets\" to the isolated Caldari system of Tierijev. This
    report follows confirmation that millions of Caldari troops supported by armor,
    MTACs, and gunships have launched frontal assaults on the two largest cities of
    Tovil and Arcurio. Although some pockets of Federation police and marines are
    fighting back, it appears that the vast majority of defenses in both of these
    cities was obliterated during the bombardment. \n\nCivilian casualty reports remain
    varied, as the bulk of Caldari citizens remain largely isolated because of President
    Foiritan\u2019s efforts to quell civil unrest in the past several weeks. \n\n_Posted
