    - Several Caldari leaders took time over the last week to express their opinions
    on the apparent reconciliation between King Khanid II and the Amarr throne. The
    overall tone of their comments was quite positive, though some voices on the CEP
    were cautious; insiders say that some members of the Wiyrkomi and Sukuuvestaa
    delegations are worried about the threat a renewed Amarr-Khanid state would pose
    to the interstellar balance of power.\n\nNone of the State's corporate leaders
    expressed those concerns publicly, however. State Executor Tibus Heth, who was
    celebrating the anniversary of the invasion of Caldari Prime in Piak, where his
    rise began, told workers that \"the renewed relations between our two strongest
    allies will be a great benefit to the State and its citizens, both economically
    and politically. It is my great hope that this will only hasten Amarr's success
    against Gallente's Minmatar puppet state, mirroring our own great successes on
    the Federation front.\"\n\nIshukone CEO Mens Reppola and Lai Dai CEO Alakoni Ishanoya
    held a joint press conference at Ishukone headquarters in Malkalen, where the
    two have been meeting for several days at Reppola's request. \"Both our corporations
    are strong partners with the Khanid Kingdom and Amarr Empire, and we believe this
    reconciliation will be quite profitable for our corporations and the State,\"
    said Ishanoya.\n\n\"I am always glad to see friends put aside their difficulties
    and try to forge a more prosperous future together,\" said Reppola. \"While this
    will no doubt be of great benefit to the State, the true measure of its value
    will be what improvements it brings to the subjects of both the King and the Empress.\""
