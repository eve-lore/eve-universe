    works plan was opened yesterday in a grand public ceremony. The new cathedral,
    located in Ardishapur Prime's biggest city, is one of the largest in the entire
    Empire. Thanks to a massive investment of slave and free labor, the cathedral
    was constructed in record time.\n\nYonis Ardishapur, alongside representatives
    of the Theology Council, christened the cathedral in the name of St. Articus,
    a move that has surprised some. St. Articus is not a well-known saint, being most
    remembered by Scriptural experts as playing a moderate role in establishing the
    Amarrian doctrine of Sacred Flesh.   \n  \n\"St. Articus is a true paragon of
    the Amarr faith,\" said Ardishapur in his speech. \"He exemplifies everything
    that is proper with the Amarr way. He fought - often in secret - to preserve the
    righteous way of the Amarr people in the face of corruption and impurity. He is
    a True Amarrian saint; the only proper kind and it honors me to dedicate this
    cathedral in his name.\"  \n  \nFollowing the dedication ceremony, Father Matius
    Aldor led the gathering in prayer. It is expected the cathedral will serve as
    the place of worship for over a million Amarrian citizens."
