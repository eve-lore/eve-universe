    Misu Banyia, the four empires have each sent messages expressing their condolences
    to the Jove Empire. Additionally, Chief Executive Panel spokesman Kuuvar Mesarnur
    yesterday released a statement wherein the Caldari State expresses regret at the
    killing of unofficial Jovian spokesman Veniel in New Caldari last Friday -- an
    incident attributable to the tremendous population in the system at the time,
    which caused decreased response time from the on-site Caldari security forces.
    \  \n  \nNo official communication has been received from the Jovians since the
    Friday in question, when Tunai Moran, CONCORD\u2019s Jovian representative, issued
    a strongly worded statement condemning Veniel\u2019s murder and calling the Caldari
    State to task on their negligence. Moran, however, has in the last two days brought
    to light certain facts regarding the status of Baniya\u2019s project and the liaison
    himself. Apparently, as he began to disintegrate, Baniya\u2019s last-minute brain
    scan, a crucial element in the cloning process, was only partly able to penetrate
    the transportation device\u2019s tremendously dense Fullerine casing, causing
    the Jovian\u2019s clone to activate without the necessary brain functions to sustain
    it. The clone, therefore, died mere seconds after being given life.   \n  \nMoran
    has also reportedly said that the Jove Empire may, using advanced DNA sampling
    and retro-scanning techniques, be able to bring Baniya back, given that they can
    collect enough of his biomass to extract a sufficient amount of the cells needed
    for the procedures.   \n  \nIn the wake of this news, word is beginning to spread
    in diplomatic circles that the four empires, working jointly through representatives
    in CONCORD\u2019s inner circle, have begun plans on the massive undertaking of
    collecting Baniya\u2019s body parts in order to present them to the Jovians. Additionally,
    whispers on the grapevine point to tensions mounting between the empires as to
    which of the four will manage to procure the greatest amount of Baniya\u2019s
    biomass, thus currying future favor with the Jove Empire. No official announcements
    have been made yet, but according to confirmed reports, pieces of the Jovian delegate
    have begun exchanging hands on galactic markets for vast sums.   \n  \nMore updates
    as they arrive."
