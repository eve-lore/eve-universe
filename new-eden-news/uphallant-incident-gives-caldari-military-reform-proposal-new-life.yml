    - A military reform proposal submitted by the Caldari Providence Directorate in
    April appears to be getting new life as a result of Internal Security's attack
    on a civilian convoy in Uphallant last week. Nugoeihuvi had previously led opposition
    to the proposal, but the actions of their security arm have reportedly made CBD
    and Sukuuvestaa uncomfortable with supporting their longtime ally in this matter.\n\nMeanwhile,
    sources close to the Ishukone board are reporting that the patriot bloc is pushing
    hard for new CEO Mens Reppola to support the proposal. Political observers point
    to Reppola's strong loyalty toward the Navy as a reason for patriot hopes in this
    matter, despite the fact that he has raised strong objections to Provist policies
    over the last several months.\n\nHowever, not all pundits think Reppola's support
    is a sure thing. \"Reppola still owes Modern Finances, a Nugoeihuvi subsidiary,
    for their part in his stock buyout,\" said Nukanata Jaasaken, a political consultant
    with the Mercantile Club. \"He's also the former CEO of a megacorporate security
    firm, and as such knows the necessity of making sure corporate security is loyal
    to the corporation first and foremost. There's no guarantee he will back the Navy
    over the interests of Ishukone, and if he does, there may be repercussions for
    him personally, both from inside and outside the company.\""
