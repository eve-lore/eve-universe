    exhaustive safety testing and extensive computer modeling, we have determined
    that advances in warp field mathematics are safe and effective for use in existing
    equipment, and so have released this code to the public.\u201D The new firmware
    code allows the generation of \u201Ccleaner\u201D warp fields, resulting in much
    faster travel.   \n  \nNew insights into the interaction between so-called \u201Cgummy
    attractor\u201D particles allow significant decreases in the field density of
    generated warp fields, allowing objects below a certain mass-to-volume threshold
    travel through space inside warp fields moving at a significantly increased rate.
    \  \n  \nGeld Odling, acting as scientific advisor for CONCORD\u2019s Public Relations
    department, attempted to explain the breakthrough to a crowd of reporters in CONCORD\u2019s
    Istodard IX, Moon 5 office. \u201CAll warp fields are essentially \u2018depleted\u2019
    energy bubbles, with a positive and negative charge generated by gummy attractor
    flow along the axis of travel, which is determined by adductor generator plates
    rotating in relation to each other inside a ship\u2019s warp core. These new findings
    allow tunings and refinements in how these plates \u2018pulse,\u2019 which generate
    cleaner fields, which therefore travel faster. It\u2019s the whole field\u2014not
    just the ship\u2014that\u2019s moving through space.\u201D The findings, rumored
    to be part of an abandoned research project from the now-defunct Crielere Labs
    institution, allow a higher stable pulse rate in warp core generators.   \n  \nThe
    generation of more and higher velocity \u201Cgummy attractors,\u201D or particles
    which interact with and influence the \u201Ccolor force\u201D in subatomic particles,
    create more highly charged \u201Cdepletion fields,\u201D which move through space
    at much higher rates of speed. These depletion fields are generated by gluon manipulation.
    Gluons are \u201Cmassless\u201D elementary particles that bind subatomic particles
    together and are ultimately believed to be responsible for the stability of atomic
    nuclei. Gummy attractors exist in a sub-gluon state, generating the same sort
    of subatomic attraction among hadrons\u2014a quark-gluon particle\u2014and gluons.
    Unlike the \u201Cabsolute\u201D nature of gluon attraction, these \u201Cgummy
    particles\u201D have some \u201Cgive\u201D to them, hence their name. The gummy
    particles allow \u201Chand off\u201D and \u201Cflow\u201D of gluons and hadrons,
    resulting in energy fields of very low subatomic density.   \n  \nThe creation
    of these cleaner fields is currently limited to objects of a certain density.
    \u201CA lot of the math is over my head\u2014this wasn\u2019t my exact field of
    study at Pator Tech,\u201D said Odling, \u201Cbut what I\u2019ve been told by
    the experts is that this basically means objects of a certain density can have
    these fields generated around them, but if an object has too much mass in relation
    to its displacement volume, these fields aren\u2019t stable and can lead to some
    unpredictable effects. Effectively, this means all current frigate-class hulls,
    because of their size, and industrial-class hulls, because of their relative mass,
    have received the new microcode allowing faster warp travel. Smaller ships will
    travel more quickly, at about twice the previous speed, and larger ships will
    see a gain of about one-and-one-half previous speeds.\u201D   \n  \nAs is usual
    in the release of firm- or software revisions, the new instructions are transmitted
    to ships from stargates whenever they launch, dock, or make use of stargates for
    interstellar travel. Most ships currently in operation should already have received
    the firmware upgrade at the time of this writing."
