    by the lasers of the Kor-Azor fleet, a Speaker of Truths appeared and demanded
    they hold their fire. \n\nLast week had seen the escalation of events on Liparer
    II with the Holders rising in near-rebellion against the rule of House Kor-Azor.
    The House's representative promptly gave a deadline for submission, adding that
    it would otherwise send a fleet to \u201Ccompletely obliterate all resistance\u201D.
    As the Holders did not stand down, a fleet was dispatched to destroy the estates.
    It was then that a Speaker of Truths intervened. \n\nThe Speaker of Truths, known
    as Brother Joshua, asked that the Admiral in charge returned to Kor Azor so that
    the Speaker could arbitrate between the two parties involved in the Liparer crisis.
    Furthermore, Brother Joshua announced that he would be traveling through the Kor-Azor
    region to investigate the situation, speaking to Holder and commoner alike. It
    is very rare for a Speaker of Truths to appear in such a fashion, and this is
    the first such occurrence for nearly a century, has been the subject of great
    surprise and speculation. \n\nWhen asked about the situation, the Theology Council
    responded, \u201CWhen approached by the Speakers of Truth for permission to investigate
    the allegations stemming from the Kor-Azor region, we duly gave it. We wish Brother
    Joshua Godspeed on his mission.\u201D \n\nAs a reporter inquired after the recent
    allegations of attacks upon the Theology Council, and any links these attacks
    might have to Kor-Azor, the Theology council refused to comment, stating only
    that \u201Cour investigations are continuing.\u201D \n\nThe consensus on GalNet
    is that the arrival of the Speaker of Truths is a \xB4welcome development\xB4
    and that overall the people are hopeful the situation will be solved without bloodshed."
