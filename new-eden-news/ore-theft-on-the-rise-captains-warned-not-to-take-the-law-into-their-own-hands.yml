- body: "ORE THEFT - a practice frowned upon by most and reviled by legitimate miners
    seems to be on the rise. Ore thieves are dastardly pilots who take advantage of
    others that are using non-secure containers to mine in empire space, claiming
    right of salvage from the jettisoned cans - even if they are sitting right next
    to the owner's ship.   \n  \n\"Unfortunately, right of salvage is law. My government
    has been attempting to push a bill that changes this in CONCORD protected space,
    but things happen slowly. Frankly, the other empires' response has been less than
    enthusiastic, ranging from calling us a bunch of 'weak Gallentes' to mere indifference.\"
    said Gallente senator Jean Zerren.   \n  \nMany a frustrated captain has lost
    his ship to CONCORD when faced with a \"salvager\" and decided to protect his
    investment with his turrets. In instances such as this, the police has no choice
    but to destroy the offending ship.   \n  \n\"You asked for a tough CONCORD. That's
    what you got.\" quipped an anonymous outlaw when asked how he felt about ore thieves."
