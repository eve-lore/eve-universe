- body: 'Amarr - Elseth Jarim, a minor Holder within House Sarum, yesterday announced
    the development of a new breed of flower that she is calling Jamyl''s Rose.


    The breed is reportedly a mix of several similar species indigenous to various
    worlds across the Empire. Holder Jarim has been quoted as saying "the development
    of Jamyl''s Rose is meant to reflect the effect the Empress has had on the Empire
    since her miraculous return ... uniting the disparate parts of Amarr into one
    glorious, unified form."


    Images of Jamyl''s Rose have not yet been released. Holder Jarim intends to produce
    enough plants to decorate the entire venue of the Empress''s coronation ceremony
    with the new breed, and will be keeping the look of the flower under wraps until
    that time.'
