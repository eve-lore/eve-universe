- body: "The news that the Caldari won favor with the Jovians has met with mixed reaction
    within the Amarr Empire. While the Imperial Chancellor has sent formal congratulations
    to the Caldari State, thanking them for an honorable competition; the Theology
    Council has criticized how the competition was configured, claiming it favored
    the Caldari and the Gallenteans. Uriam Kador has even went so far as saying that
    he was convinced that the whole thing was rigged from the outset, as everyone
    knew that the Jovians favored the Caldari anyway and hated the Amarrians.   \n
    \ \nGyt Quisog, the Jovian responsible for the body part collection effort, has
    vehemently denied these accusations, stating that each race were on equal footing
    from the onset. \u201CEvery possible step was taken to assure fairness in the
    competition,\u201D he is quoted as saying. \u201CIn my opinion the competition
    was a great success. Every race competed with passion, yet honesty.\u201D Quisog
    finished.   \n  \nMeanwhile, the Imperial Chamberlain has issued a statement on
    behalf of the Emperor where those Amarrian pilots that participated in the competition
    are thanked for their efforts. The statement especially mentions members of the
    PIE Corporation and their associates as model subjects, who ceaselessly and unselfishly
    act to strengthen the Empire and aid the Emperor. Others mentioned in the statement
    are those that managed to collect a whole batch, which entitles them to a limited
    blueprint from the Jovians in due time. Those are: Alexia Sonique, Chimi, Aralis,
    Darklogan, Therax and Dreck Morrison. Aralis was especially active, turning in
    four batches."
