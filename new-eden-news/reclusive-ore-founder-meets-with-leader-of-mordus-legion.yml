- body: "Orion Mashel, the founder of the Outer Ring Excavations company, is known
    for his secluded nature. He never travels outside his fortress-like home in the
    Heart constellation and very rarely invites visitors. Thus, whenever he meets
    with someone it is always a point of considerable interest for the press and it
    is now chewing over what Mashel\u2019s meeting with Muryia Mordu, leader of Mordu\u2019s
    Legion mercenary corps means. Especially in the light the Legion guards ORE property
    in the Outer Region.   \n  \nThe two met yesterday at Mashel\u2019s sprawling
    complex, the meeting lasted more than two hours and when Mordu left he was visibly
    upset. But he declined to comment to the media waiting outside and left in a hurry.
    Calls to Mashel himself were not returned.   \n  \nOrion Mashel founded ORE several
    decades ago when the private corporations were taking their first tentative steps
    outside empire space. His company grew rich trading in Nocxium, which back then
    was in heavy demand. ORE established itself in the Outer Ring region and surrounding
    areas, scouting out the systems better than anyone before or since. The company
    is thought to know the locations of fabulously wealthy asteroid fields deep in
    space, which they mine slowly so as to not flood the market.   \n  \nMashel withdrew
    from the public eye some half a century ago and has since lived almost as a hermit
    in the midst of the Outer Region. But he still manages to be well informed about
    goings on in the outside world and the few times he has stuck his neck out it
    has always turned out to be transitional periods for his company; either to save
    it from looming threats or to expand its already great fortune to even greater
    heights. Now we are left wondering what the meeting between Mashel and Mordu portrays,
    is there some impending doom waiting to fall on ORE, or are we witnessing another
    chapter in its extraordinary success story?"
