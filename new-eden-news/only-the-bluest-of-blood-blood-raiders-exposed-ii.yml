    at an active, combative Blood Raider loyalist corporation. What do they actually
    do and why? \n\n* * *\n\n**CRUORIS SERAPHIM [CR-SE]**\n\n* * *\n\nIn a sect where
    blood is everything, it should come as no surprise that among the most active
    and prominent, though least vocal, there boasts a proud descent from the Blood
    Inquisition \u2013 the organization that worked with Omir Sarikusa himself in
    causing the Mabnen I rebellion. \n\nThe corporation\u2019s leader, Cyshade, is
    a slender, yet muscular Civire woman \u2013 like many pilots, she seems young
    for the many terrible things she has seen and done. Of course, in Cyshade\u2019s
    case, these things are more lurid than most. \n\nSince her beginnings as a humble
    industrialist, driven to near-bankruptcy by SCC taxes, Cyshade has wandered a
    little, but was always drawn back to the Covenant and its cause. Now, with Cruoris
    Seraphim, she seeks to embody the very epitome of a Blood Raider corporation.
    She explained their current priorities to me as follows: \n\n\u201CWhen The Bleak
    Lands stations were surrendered, many Covenant supporters felt\u2026 abandoned
    by Sarikusa, and that he was a fool and a coward - including myself at the time.
    I was subsequently persuaded by Countess Myadra and others, of the wisdom in his
    decision. \n\n\u201CI now await his return, and the annihilation of the Amarr
    Empire. \n\n\u201C[To prepare for that day], we hone our combat skills, and blood
    the infidels.\u201D \n\nFor a new pilot, the move from practicing the Sani Sabik
    privately to putting it into practice in space, in the company of fellow believers,
    can be a big one. Cyshade explained what she looks for in a potential recruit
    that makes her believe he or she will last the distance: \n\n\u201CA mix of qualities,
    particularly combat ability is important, I'd suppose... but also an open mind.
    So much of the cluster is so regrettably blinkered when it comes to our organization.\u201D
    \n\nWhile Cyshade declined to reveal to me the exact nature of her corporation\u2019s
    activities, we can exclusively disclose (after some very minimal investigation)
    that they are engaged in exuberantly vicious acts of piracy. Raking through lowsec
    and 0.0 in small to medium packs, Cruoris Seraphim strike and fade, vanishing
    like the hungry ghosts the superstitious believe them to be, seldom leaving either
    wreck or corpse to say they were there. Olaf Vingle, a cleaner on the docks at
    the Republic Parliament Bureau near Skarkon III, described a chilling experience:
    \n\n\u201CI\u2019m just a simple janitor \u2013 my job is to mop the floors of
    Hanger 13, clean up any spilled coolant, lubricant\u2026 anything that someone
    might slip on or eat its way through the floor, basically. \n\n\u201CAnyway, I
    hadn\u2019t noticed anything strange when I was mopping, but when I came to empty
    my bucket, the water was red\u2026 deep, deep red. \n\n\u201CI can only think
    it was something dripping off one of the ships\u2026 rust that had been sanded
    off, maybe, or sometimes bodies bounce off the hulls when they\u2019re at speed
    and\u2026 well, it ain\u2019t pleasant when they defrost. \n\n\u201CSo that\u2019s
    when I checked the docking logs, and saw one of these Blood Raider sorts was docked
    there. I couldn\u2019t say which ship it was; I heard they flew these weird, bloodstained
    ships that look like they\u2019re snarling at you, but they all looked the same.
    That\u2019s when I decided maybe life as a farmer wasn\u2019t so bad after all.\u201D
    \n\nIf this is the present horror of the Blood Raiders, where does their future
    lie? If Omir Sarikusa should return, where will he strike first? I asked Cyshade
    who would be first against the wall when the Blood Raider revolution comes, and
    she had this to say: \n\n\u201CI wouldn't say theres going to be a 'revolution'.
    I'd call it a war of extermination. It\u2019s hard to be say who will be first
    against the wall\u2026 \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s be easier to say who won't be.\u201D
