- body: "ERAM - Gerne Broteau has been executed after being declared guilty by the
    Sebiestor Tribal Court after a trial which continued without interruption for
    36 hours. The tribal judges sentenced Broteau to death for his attack on a Minmatar
    cultural festival in the Gallente Federation which left 59 dead, including Sebiestor
    Tribal Chief Karin Midular. \n\nShortly after the verdict and sentence were delivered,
    Broteau was led from the court and executed by a firing-squad of hand-picked Sebiestor
    warriors from Karin Midular's clan. Neither the Republic authorities or any other
    tribe chose to contest the sentence, a step that would have automatically elevated
    the matter to an appeals court.\n\nThe swiftness of the trial and particularly
    the execution is unusual inside the Republic, leading some commentators to criticize
    their actions. The Sebiestor Tribe has released a short statement saying, \"Justice
    was served. No punishment can truly fit the crime committed; we dispensed the
    most fitting justice possible.\""
