    has gone into hiding after allegations of strange behaviour have appeared in the
    press.\n\nProfessor Foucalt, who has dedicated his life to the study of Automated
    technology in zero-g environments, is staying resolutely silent after a former
    mistress has accused him of \u201Cunnatural practices\u201D. A retired Naval Officer,
    he is well known and well liked within Gallentean educational circles.\n\n\u201CWe
    were close friends for almost a year; he used to come to me to wind down after
    a hard day\u2019s work,\u201D revealed Liberienne Houlliente, society playgirl
    and heiress to a chain of nightclubs across Sinq Laison. \u201CAt first, it was
    just the usual, a drink, someone to talk to, someone to share his problems with;
    but then it turned physical after a night out on The Crystal Boulevard.\u201D
    She related how Foucalt \u2018groomed\u2019 her into his world of perversion.
    \u201CHe started asking me to wear certain kinds of perfume, which were horrible
    to smell. It wasn\u2019t until later I realised what he was doing. The perfume
    contained pheromones, although I wasn\u2019t aware at the time.\u201D\n\n\u201CHe
    took advantage of my innocence. I thought at first that these were just harmless
    games, but it seems that he needed something extra.\u201D She continued, \u201CHe
    asked me to make strange, mewing noises; I feel so humiliated now, I wish I could
    have seen what was coming.\u201D Foucalt appeared at Liberienne\u2019s apartment
    one night in a state of visible excitement, carrying a large bag. When he opened
    the bag, to Liberienne\u2019s horror, it contained a fancy dress outfit. \u201CThis
    was no ordinary fancy dress. I mean there is nothing wrong with a little role-play,
    don\u2019t think of me as a prude. This was a full sized Fedo outfit, and this
    disgusting old man wanted me to wear it in bed!\u201D She collapses in tears.\n\nLiberienne,
    a recovering alcoholic, kept quiet about the whole sordid affair, until Foucalt
    made it clear he had grown tired of her, and stopped returning her calls. \u201CI
    feel so empty. He used me and abused me; I expected more from a man with his reputation.\u201D
    Fighting back tears, she continued, \u201CHe has ruined my life, I can\u2019t
    look at myself in the mirror anymore, and I knew it was time to go public about
    this pervert and his Fedophilia!\u201D\n\nWhen asked if she still possessed the
    fancy dress outfit, Liberienne revealed she had destroyed it, along with the perfume
    that Foucalt forced her to wear. She has kept a pharmacist\u2019s report that
    showed the perfume was impregnated with Fedo pheromones.\n\nFoucalt's secretary
    at his office in Balle made the following public statement: \u201CIt is true that
    Professor Foucalt had a relationship with Ms. Liberienne Houlliente, which he
    ended recently. Professor Foucalt states that he ended the relationship after
    Ms. Houlliente asked him to leave his wife and children. He refused to do so,
    and this is nothing more than a dirty smear campaign to disgrace a fine, upstanding
    academic.\u201D\n\nProfessor Foucalt himself was \u201Cunavailable for comment\u201D
    today at his private residence in Scuelazyns. His wife of thirty-seven years,
    Juissene, is \u201Cstanding firm by his side while this nasty business is concluded.\u201D
    It is reported that he has been working on new military applications of Drone
    tech, and that his work will undoubtedly suffer from these allegations."
