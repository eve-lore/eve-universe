- body: 'FD-MLJ, Syndicate - Special Accounts Manager Lee Brinalle provided an update
    on the Upwell Consortium prototype citadel construction project in a short briefing
    today. Hailing the efforts of capsuleers supplying rare and sophisticated research
    components for Upwell''s _Astrahus_ -class citadel construction project, Lee Brinalle
    noted that already she had received enough components to guarantee _Astrahus_
    BPCs for two lucky winners in the draw that Upwell will be holding.


    "I want to thank and commend our capsuleer community. We''ve seen the real face
    of the future builders and colonizers of the deep reaches of space with the research
    component project. I have been amazed at the response and I am looking forward
    to being able to award more _Astrahus_ BPCs and, perhaps, if the efforts continue
    at this pace, to rewarding one lucky capsuleer collaborator with a _Fortizar_
    BPC!"


    Taking questions, Lee Brinalle was asked about the security of the construction
    sites and if Upwell had any response to the latest demands by "The OSS", an independent
    capsuleer alliance that featured heavily in the destruction of the sites a few
    days ago.


    "Security has been enhanced over and above the original levels and we have been
    assured by the Upwell Department of Friendship and Mutual Assistance that all
    traces of the illegal AI virus introduced into the original sites'' systems have
    been purged from our constructors. As for the renegade alliance you refer to,
    they have had a clear response from us and their demands are absurd. If there
    is doubt, let there be none, we will use every tool at our disposal when it comes
    to dealing with criminals and gangsters that attempt to block progress towards
    the World of Tomorrow!"'
