- body: "The Caldari State has revealed that the budget for the Caldari Navy will
    be slashed for the 10th consecutive year. A high-ranking official was quoted as
    saying: \u201CThe war with the Federation is long since over and in our estimate
    there is no imminent threat on the horizon. Besides, our annual spending for CONCORD
    forces has been on the rise, which counterbalances the cuts for the Navy. We are
    confident that despite these cuts our Navy will still be more than capable of
    performing its duty 100%.\u201D   \n  \nThe Caldari armament industry has yet
    again criticized the decision, claiming that the history of the Caldari people
    amply demonstrates the need for a strong space fleet and that these cuts are jeopardizing
    the national security of the State. Furthermore, spokesmen for the armament industry
    predict these cuts will put small armament companies under and force larger companies
    to cut down on their R&D; efforts, which can seriously affect the technological
    armament race being held with the Federation and others.   \n  \nState officials
    have dismissed these doomsday prophecies, stating that the same claims have been
    heard for 10 years now, yet the Caldari armament industry has shown no signs of
    a decline, if anything it has grown over this period. This indicates that the
    armament companies have adapted to the new situation by finding customers outside
    the State. Indeed, State officials have gone on the offensive by insisting that
    the identities of these customers should be revealed, something that the armament
    companies are unwilling to do."
