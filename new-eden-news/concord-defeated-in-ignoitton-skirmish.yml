    Officers by two extremely heavily armed Guristas pilots, one of them being infamous
    Lucash Helmatt.   \n  \nA daring engagement took place in Ignoitton between the
    Concord forces and the two \u2018Rattlesnake\u2019 class battleships, resulting
    in one of the Concord Battleships succumbing to enemy fire, and causing Commander
    Plavers of Concord\u2019s Special Forces division to retreat. It is well known
    that Lucash has crossed swords with Commander Plavers before, however until now
    this was with limited success.   \n  \nIt is rumoured that the Guristas attacked
    the Concord ships to obtain a valuable item they were carrying. This rumour is
    strengthened by this piece of communication, which was intercepted moments before
    Lucash and his wingman left the system: \u201CWe have what we came for; it is
    time for us to leave\u201D. Even though Concord officials refused to comment on
    the ship\u2019s contents prior to its destruction, sources within the agency revealed
    today that the bodies of certain terrorists were scheduled to be transported through
    the Caldari State on the day of question \u2013 including those of Mercurion Red
    and Bleak Scarab. Although it does not state the names of the pilots assigned
    to this mission it is possible that this was indeed the cargo of the doomed ship.
    \  \n  \nA Concord official however did put out a statement urging all pilots
    to be on the lookout for Lucash, describing him as an extremely dangerous and
    violent individual. Pilots are advised not to engage this Pirate single-handedly,
    but to contact a Concord official as soon as possible."
