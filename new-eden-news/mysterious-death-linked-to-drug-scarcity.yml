- body: "PLACID: The gruesome discovery of the body of a man identified as Bevarius
    Qolemar has been made in Osmeden, baffling investigators with the severity of
    injuries suffered showing signs of torture and alleged links to organised crime.
    \n\nThe grisly remains of the victim, whom had been missing for a week were found
    in his quarters and whilst the exact cause of death is still under question, it
    has been reported that he was tortured over an extended period of time. \n\nStation
    security stated that they had found the body after being informed that there had
    been no sign of the victim and numerous attempts to contact him went unanswered.
    \n\nA spokesman for the station said: \u201CWe were not expecting this, we simply
    thought he had left without anyone knowing. Given that he was receiving numerous
    messages from various locations in Syndicate and his involvement in the drug trafficking
    group \u2018Euphoric Gaze\u2019, we have no doubt that his death is connected
    to the criminal elements of the area.\u201D \n\nAttempts to contact other members
    of the victim\u2019s organisation have also been unsuccessful; however, a review
    of the last transmissions Qolemar sent shows that he was planning to flee to Syndicate,
    from Idatheth Khora.   \nWho or what Idatheth Khora is remains a mystery at this
    time. \n\nMany observers believe that this murder is directly responsible for
    the drastic reduction in the production and distribution of Rise, a powerful narcotic,
    created by Sundari Idama who employed the deceased. Due to this shortage, many
    users have begun to suffer withdrawal symptoms, which include severe depression,
    and suicidal tendencies. \n\nVorada Kuvakei, former Mordu Legion officer and now
    head of the Intaki organisation, Illoren, was asked about these incidents but
    only commented that the death of Qolemar was \u2018needlessly brutal\u2019 and
    that \u2018the decline of the drug Rise, is but the first step in Placid\u2019s
    recovery, and the growth and empowerment of the Intaki people\u2019. \n\nDue to
    the lack of Federation and CONCORD presence in this investigation, the Intaki
    Space Police have been in full control of the situation. The Syndicate itself
    has not given any sort of official statement on these events; however a source,
    who wishes to remain anonymous, claimed that when news broke of the murder, several
    members of the Syndicate retired to their quarters claiming illness.   \nWhile
    CONCORD presence has been non-existent during the investigation, they have issued
    a brief statement on the drug known as Rise. It reads: \u201CWe have received
    various inquiries and comments about this new drug that has surfaced in Placid.
    We are continuing to gather samples of the drug when possible, our initial tests
    have shown this drug to be highly dangerous to those who use it, with the risk
    of overdose being nearly triple that of any current narcotic.\u201D \n\n\u201CGiven
    these dangers, it has been decided that the substance is to be outlawed and ask
    that citizens please inform local enforcement agencies of any use or trafficking
    of the dangerous substance. Those who have created this drug will cease their
    activities immediately, or face prosecution,\u201D concluded CONCORD. \n\nWhether
    or not this is sees an end to production of Rise or is just a blip in Idama and
    others\u2019 plans, remains to be seen."
