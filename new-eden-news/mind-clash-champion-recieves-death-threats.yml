- body: "Only a few days after the announcement of the annual Mind Clash tournament,
    current Champion Joelyn Donalokos has received death threats warning against his
    participation. This latest development has put further doubt around the tournament,
    and has fuelled previously rising tensions between the two empires. In the face
    of the threats, Donalokos has remained defiant, stating he will not be intimidated
    and will continue his preparations. \n\nMajor networks were quick to pick up the
    threat, which was leaked to the underground news outlets at the same time it was
    delivered to Joelyn. In the note it was claimed \u201Cthe Blue Tiger will become
    a mascot for dead Gallente traitors.\u201D At this time, the origins of the note
    or the group behind it remain unknown. The warning followed the official announcement
    that this years Mind Clash tournament would be held on Caldari Prime, a move that
    has sparked controversy beyond the realm of just the entertainment business. \n\nOn
    a broader political scale, Gallente-Caldari tensions have been renewed, as the
    Federation Nationalists continue to exert pressure to have the venue changed,
    citing concerns for security and what Roden Spokesperson Orvecel Raouli called
    \u201Ca lack of respect.\u201D Responses from the State corporations remain varied,
    in what many are claiming is a strategic move to stall and deflate the Federation
    Nationals on the issue. \n\nOnly hours ago, Roden continued to apply its influence
    and called for a temporary closure of over half their offices in the Sinq Laison
    region, citing Article 237 of CONCORD\u2019s Iyen-Oursta Treaty, allowing Federation
    offices located in the Border Zone to restrict Caldari access without stated reason
    for a maximum time of no longer than an hour. The unprecedented use of the Article
    as a political tool has raised a more concerned and unified stance from the State,
    although still at an unofficial level. Most agree that the lost trade revenue
    from the office closures is a trifle compared to any postponement or cancellation
    of the tournament. \n\nDonalokos himself was adamant in the continuation of the
    tournament stating, \u201CThis shouldn\u2019t be about politics, this should be
    about the game and people want the game to go on.\u201D Whilst his management
    team stated they took all threats very seriously, Donalokos himself seemed untroubled
    by recent events, commenting that his mind was \u201Calready focused on the matches
    ahead.\u201D Some have commented that the current Champion is already under a
    lot of pressure to attend, with the financial success of the tournament riding
    on the attention his presence brings. \n\nMind Clash officials have stated that
    they will increase personal security for the Champion, as well as at the venue
    overall. In an effort to appease growing concerns on both sides, vast sums of
    ISK have already been sunk into public security contracts that will help ensure
    the peace on match day. Satirists and comedians have already commented on the
    situation, saying that the Mind Clash has already begun in the political realm,
    with each side already using its own unique chimeras in the battle of ISK over
    ideals."
