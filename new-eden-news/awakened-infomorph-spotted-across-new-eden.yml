    the past two weeks, an Awakened Informorph has been increasingly spotted in systems
    across New Eden. New and interesting developments have followed in its wake including
    increased Sleeper aggression, changes in Sansha strategy and the reported construction
    of new Drone structures in the Genesis region.  \n  \n[![Drone Structure in Promised
    Land](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4681/4681-drone1thumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4681/4681-drone1.png)\u200BLast
    Tuesday the Blazing Angels alliance discovered an \"Awakened Infomorph\" on their
    directional scans during standard wormhole mining operations. Shortly after, a
    wormhole opened up in \"the middle of the gravimetric site and sleepers came pouring
    out.\" stated Slade Nightstrum.  \n  \n\u200BDuring last week's Sansha blockade
    of Jita in the New Caldari system, an Awakened Infomorph was spotted observing
    the battle between capsuleers and Citizen Astur.  \n  \n\u200BFinally, reports
    from The Synenose Accord [SYNE] this past Saturday say they've spotted an Awakened
    Infomorph in the Promised Land and surrounding region. This region was once dominated
    by Bloodraider pirates. However their influence is being slowly displaced by an
    increasing Rogue Drone presence. Local and SYNE pilots have confirmed that \"Rogue
    Drone hives are now appearing in the area. Visual analysis suggests that their
    sites are generally small-to-medium sized, off-grid, and in the medium-to-late
    stages of construction.\" Speaking to SYNE pilot Unit XS365BT, she let slip that
    there was \"another Drone complex within the Dead End system\" which she recently
    surveyed.  \n  \n\u200BIt is unknown whether it has been the same Awakened Infomorph
    in all three sightings. However its presence has been linked to unusual events.\n\n###
