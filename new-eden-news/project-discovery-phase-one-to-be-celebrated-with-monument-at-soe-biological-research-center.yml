- body: 'Lanngisi, Metropolis Region - The SOE have announced that their planned monument
    to Project Discovery Phase One will be moved into position outside the Sisters
    of EVE Bureau in orbit of the second moon of Lanngisi III. The monument has been
    built into a new biological research center that will operate as an isolated substation
    of the SOE''s facilities in their Lanngisi station.


    Sister Latimas of the SOE''s Sanctuary research organization said, "We are very
    happy to be able to mark the vital work of Project Discovery over the period when
    it provided the backbone of our Drifter tissue analysis through the citizen science
    research efforts of so many capsuleers. As we have long been planning to establish
    special biological research facilities here in Lanngisi, where we have carried
    out so much good work in the field of space medicine, we have taken the opportunity
    to incorporate a lasting memorial to Project Discovery Phase One."


    Sister Latimas would not be drawn on the topic of the transfer of Project Discovery
    to CONCORD oversight or how the new center and memorial were funded but she remarked
    that "the SOE is very pleased to see citizen science continue among the capsuleer
    community and especially on such a vital research area as exoplanet hunting."


    The Project Discovery Phase One Monument is expected to be in position tomorrow
    and will feature an interactive record and database of elite capsuleer research
    achievement.'
