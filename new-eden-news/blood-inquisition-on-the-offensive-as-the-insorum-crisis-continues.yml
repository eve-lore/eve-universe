- body: "The Blood inquisition, a corporation which has achieved notoriety this week
    with their very public campaigning and defence of Blood Raider space during their
    critical attacks, are stepping up their campaign another notch. News has reached
    us that the Blood Inquisition, along with 4 other covenant sympathiser corporations
    are planning to create an alliance with the goals of defending Blood Raider space
    and move their cause of bringing the Amarr Empire to its knees forwards.   \n
    \ \nSpeaking to me earlier today, Myadra of the Blood Inquisition was full of
    pride and glee in the fact that a lot of their hard work in supporting the Blood
    Raiders was beginning to pay off. She spoke of her long term involvement with
    the cult. Working as a double agent in the Abolition party of Amarr - and later,
    the CVA - she told me how she tried to work pilots up against each other and create
    civil war in the alliances, destabilising one of the pillars of the defence of
    the Empire from within. \"I have deceived and influenced the CVA command and PIE
    leadership to the Covenant's wishes, all the while still working for them, and
    almost causing a civil war.\"   \n  \nSpeaking of their goals, Myadra had this
    to say: \"I'm just glad we have the tools now to make it all possible,\" referring
    to the Insorum drug that the Blood Raiders have been synthesising since seizing
    the wife of the late Dr. Hnolku.   \n  \nWhen asked if they would ever hand over
    or sell the Vitoc cure, Myadra recoiled in disgust. \"Since it\u2019s a mutagenic
    drug, it cannot be synthesised without the proper research tools and databases
    that the good doctor had. Our plans for the drug is to further our cause. I would
    rather destroy it, than to let it fall into the Matari's hands. So no, we will
    not sell it or hand it over to anyone.\"   \n  \nThis news has caused predictable
    dissatisfaction in scientific communities; notably, those of the Gallente Federation
    and the Minmatar Republic, both of whom were clinging onto the hope of being able
    to obtain just a small sample of the drug - a commodity worth more than its weight
    in Megacyte.   \n  \nAmarr Navy officials have reacted with contempt at the actions
    of the Blood Inquisition and other Covenant sympathiser corporations. \"You can
    be assured that we will hunt these people down. They have let down their peers,
    the citizens they swore to serve when they took up their place as capsuleers,
    and most importantly their Emperor. This is unacceptable and they can be sure
    they won\u2019t be welcomed back into the service of the Empire as anything but
    reminders of what happens to those seeking to betray their people.\""
