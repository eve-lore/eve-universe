- body: "Skiks Alfotada, Commander of Security for Republic Security Services, today
    issued a statement implicating Amarr and Ammatar \u201Cinfiltrators\u201D in the
    recent Slave Farm scandal. The statement is the culmination of nearly two weeks
    of investigation by the RSS into the tragic discovery of an \u201Cillegal and
    immoral expatriation facility\u201D in Minmatar space. The statement read, in
    part, \u201C\u2026 there can now be little doubt that Ammatar and Amarr agents,
    masquerading as Minmatar citizens and taking advantage of the free borders between
    our sovereign spaces, have again conspired against the Minmatar people to further
    historical injustices enacted upon them.\u201D \n\nThe slave processing compound
    was first uncovered by an agent in the Internal Security division of RSS, on a
    tip from an operative of Trust Partners, the lawful trading arm of the allegedly
    unlawful Thukker Mix corporation. Officials within both the RSS and Trust Partners
    declined to provide the identities of the agent or his informant, citing security
    and safety concerns. \n\nAlfrald Enstulf, commander of Internal Security for Thukker
    Mix, said, \u201CWe\u2019re indebted to the sharp eyes of this particular Trust
    Partner pilot. She noticed unusual activity in an otherwise forlorn region of
    space--numerous transport ships at regular intervals, and haulers of Minmatar
    registry being escorted by Amarr or Ammatar fighter vessels. She documented these
    flights and contacted my office, who then handed the information over to the RSS,
    as they are better capable of investigating and dealing with a crime of this nature.\u201D
    \n\nWithin hours, fast attack and transport vessels descended on the compound,
    treating the captives with any necessary first aid and readying them for transport
    to medical facilities nearby, while detaining and imprisoning anyone suspected
    of \u201Cbeing on the wrong side of the wall,\u201D as RSS Lieutenant Veteks Eska
    put it. \u201CIt was easy to tell who was who, at least in terms of victim and
    perpetrator. The captives were poorly clothed and malnourished, and glad to see
    us.\u201D \n\nOfficials were shocked to learn the slavers held Minmatar identification
    papers and transit visas, which has been widely reported. Unreported until now
    is the fact that these documents were sophisticated forgeries or illegally altered
    copies of identification documents reported as stolen or missing from a variety
    of sources. RSS Lt. Eska explains, \u201CWe were stunned, obviously. Then one
    of our Corporals noticed something odd about these supposed Minmatar slavers:
    no tribal tattoos.\u201D So began the investigation that would lead across three
    stellar regions and deep into the heart of an Empire now celebrating the ascension
    of its new Emperor. \n\nOnce the universal lack of tribal tattoos or initiation
    marks on the staff of the slave processing compound was discovered, the documentation
    these criminals presented came under closer scrutiny. Officers of Thukker Mix,
    acting as adjuncts to the larger RSS force, were instrumental in uncovering the
    counterfeits. Alfrald Enstulf said, \u201CDue to the nature of our business, Thukker
    Mix employees are familiar with forged documents. Once you know what to look for,
    they are easier to spot. We were lucky to have an expert in counterfeiting on-hand
    during that operation.\u201D \n\nThis unnamed expert identified many of the forgeries
    as the work of a known \u201Cdocument artist\u201D in the Intelligence Division
    of the Ammatar Consulate. Armed with that information, RSS technicians began poring
    over the original holovid captured by the unnamed Trust Partners pilot. After
    closer examination, several of the escort vessels were traced back to the Imperial
    Chancellor organization, making them Amarr in registry and origin. \u201CAfter
    that,\u201D said Enstulf, \u201Cit was just a matter of connecting the dots.\u201D
    \n\nWhich the RSS proceeded to do. Though lacking the sort of hard proof necessary
    for an official CONCORD board of inquiry, RSS has provided proof of identity for
    15 of the 22 slavers captured at the unnamed location, conclusively showing them
    to be Ammatar citizens. The identities of the so-called Minmatar Slavers had been
    a mystery until the RSS statement. The RSS also presented clips of analyzed holovid
    showing identifying insignia on the escort vessels marking them as Imperial Chancellor
    craft. The RSS statement calls for both official inquiry into the slave scandal
    by the Republic Parliament and an unofficial investigation of the facts by the
    appropriate CONCORD committee, and condemns the continued silence of the Amarr
    Empire and its governing bodies. \u201CWords of peace and conciliation mock the
    Minmatar people and dishonor the grave wrong-doings perpetrated against us over
    our history of struggle against the Amarr. Slavery not only continues under the
    rule of so-called peace loving Emperors as Heideran VII and Doriam Kor-Azor, but
    flourishes and expands into the heart of the Minmatar Republic. There are no words
    strong enough to communicate how exceedingly intolerable this state of affairs
    continues to be.\u201D \n\nThough the discovery of a slave compound in Minmatar
    space is still shocking to many, the idea that Minmatar citizens were complicit
    in its operation was more shocking still. Though Prime Minister Midular has yet
    to make an official statement, a representative of the Republic Parliament spoke
    briefly to reporters after the RSS statement. \u201CThe Prime Minister has been
    in contact with the RSS from the very first reports of this horrible crime, and
    she has continued to closely monitor developments. The PM feels she speaks for
    the entirety of the Republic Parliament when she says she has the utmost confidence
    in the RSS and their ability to quickly and adeptly handle issues of this nature.\u201D
    \n\nRepublic Security Services is the de facto intelligence and espionage branch
    of the Republic government, with many contacts in the burgeoning black market
    and underworld communities in and around Minmatar space. It is widely thought
    that, of all official and semiofficial Republic agencies, the RSS has access to
    the most reliable and complete information regarding illicit trade or criminal
    activity in and around Republic space. \n\nThe location of the slave processing
    compound is being kept secret to aid in the ongoing investigation and to prevent
    throngs of curious sightseers, and space lanes in and around Minmatar and Ammatar
    borders offer no clue of increased intelligence gathering activity\u2014no surprise
    to any who know the reputation of the RSS as being masters of stealth and discretion.
    Likewise, no reports of the enforced viral infection known as Vitoc addiction
    have come out of official sources. \n\nLt. Eska mirrors the feelings of many Minmatar
    when she says, \u201CIt was an incredible relief to learn that these slavers were
    not Minmatar after all\u2014but that does precious little to offset the shock
    and outrage I feel at learning of this horror. I thought we would never see slavery
    from within the borders of the Republic. I guess I was wrong.\u201D"
