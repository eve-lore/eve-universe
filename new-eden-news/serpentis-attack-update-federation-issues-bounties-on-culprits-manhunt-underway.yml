    the culprits of this morning\u2019s coordinated strike upon Gallente assets in
    the Alperaute system have been identified as Salvador Sarpati, CEO and founder
    of the Serpentis organization, and several high-level commanders and operatives
    in his personal army.   \n  \nAlso confirmed was the capture of one Gallente Soltueur
    titan, the Molyneux, by the Serpentis forces. The Molyneux is the first Gallente
    titan in history ever to be seized by a hostile force. According to Navy pilots
    who survived the battle, the vessel sustained considerable damage in the attack
    and is believed to be operating at less than full capacity.   \n  \nEyewitness
    reports indicate the group is headed into the Syndicate region, possibly intending
    to make their way to their home base in the Fountain region. Federation Navy Joint
    Operations Command has approved a CONCORD-authorized bounty of 1.2 billion ISK
    for Salvador Sarpati, 500 million ISK for Tuvan Orth, his right-hand man, and
    50 million ISK for other ranking officers in command of the Serpentis force.   \n
    \ \nSouro Foiritan, President of the Gallente Federation, in a statement at 15:00
    this afternoon exhorted all capsuleer pilots loyal to the Federation to \u201Crise
    up against the tide of villainy that threatens to destroy the very fabric of all
    we hold dear.\u201D He furthermore stated that the Sarpati family had \u201Cmade
    a war for itself that it couldn\u2019t afford,\u201D and that \u201Cthe Federation
    will do everything in its power to get the Molyneux back.\u201D   \n  \nMore news
    as we receive it."
