- body: "Agencies within the Gallente Federation have in recent weeks been engaged
    in staving off potential problems posed by the steadily escalating influx of Matari
    immigrants to regions bordering the two nations.   \n  \nAccording to a report
    released by the Federal Immigration Advisory Board to the Gallente Senate yesterday,
    the inhabitant figures of population centers in the Gallente Border Zone and Nexus
    constellations have swelled considerably in the past two months, even more so
    if the presumed number of illegal immigrants is factored in.   \n  \nThe report
    warns that \u201Ca large-scale ingress of displaced societal elements can and
    very often does contribute to slum formation, increasing crime rates and the drawing
    of hard cultural lines across areas previously unaffected by racial tensions.\u201D
    It further proposes that the Senate divert significant funds towards fiscal benefits
    for immigrants, outlining several legislature drafts for Senate consideration.
    \  \n  \n\u201CWe do agree that there is a potential problem looming there,\u201D
    stated Mentas Blaque, Gallente Senate head, at a press conference this morning.
    \u201CWe must, however, keep aware that even in times of prosperity the federal
    budget has its limits, and the wellbeing of our own has to remain a priority.
    We will take the matter up later in the week.\u201D   \n  \nBlaque has prompted
    outrage among the inhabitants of the most heavily affected areas for what is seen
    as a criminally blas\xE9 response to large-scale problems with serious implications.
    Lirianne Crulart, mayor of Des Ponticelles, this afternoon went on record stating
    that \u201Cif the esteemed Senator sees a particular distinction between border
    zone residents and other members of the Federation, I sure wouldn\u2019t mind
    him enlightening me. As far as I know, we\u2019re all citizens of the same nation.\u201D
    \  \n  \nDes Ponticelles is Bourynes III\u2019s largest city and one of the Federation\u2019s
    registered megalopoli. It is home to sixty-three million inhabitants, fifteen
    million of which are disenfranchised Matari."
