- body: "**Red alert!** Lately, CONCORD offices have been flooded with reports of
    entire fleets of pirates outside empire space reclaiming their \"sovereignty\".
    In what can only be called a concentrated effort to drive back ore prospectors
    and bounty hunters, literally hundreds of ships have met their end in the cold
    vacuum of space to this new threat. \n\n_\"We have no reason to believe that pirate
    nations and organizations such as **Sansha's nation** and **Serpentis corporation**
    are joining forces - there has been no evidence of cooperation between them -
    but we do find their simultaneous strengthening a bit mystifying.\"_ said **Haram
    Goskaktar** , the head of DED security. \n\nThe sudden strengthening of attacks
    on miners and bounty hunters in lawless space has come as a great shock to many
    pilots who had grown complacent with the ineptness of the piratical nations at
    keeping them out. \n\n_\"I swear they even have new types of ships! I didn't even
    have the presence of mind to engage my warp drive before I got shot down by that
    monster.\"_ remarked an anonymous bounty hunter, who lost his ship to a new type
    of **Angel Cartel** battleship recently. \n\nStrangely enough, not everyone seems
    bothered by this news. Some pilots even welcome the changes, saying that this
    will help keep out their competition. \n\nIndeed it might. Lone pilots are now
    advised to stay away from the areas where the pirates are concentrating their
    attacks, and corporations are implored to operate in larger groups. This reporter
    has already suffered a loss while investigating these sightings. Don't let this
    happen to you."
