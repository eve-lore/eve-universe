    1,000 Lai Dai scientists and engineers were forced to abandon a deadspace starbase
    yesterday due to a reactor leak. The starbase crew took refuge in an industrial
    vessel until they were rescued by a Peace and Order Unit fleet on patrol in the
    system. Nearly 500 cases of radiation poisoning have been reported among the refugees.\n\nThe
    cause for the reactor leak has not been reported, but according to Lai Dai officials,
    the starbase passed all security checks.  The latest safety inspection was conducted
    one month ago. Together with the attack at the Black Rise Development Conference
    and the fire at one of Lai Dai's research bases, this incident marks the third
    major security failure suffered by the corporation in as many weeks. An anonymous
    source within the corporation estimates the value of the research and development
    lost in these accidents to be nearly 300 million ISK, and potentially tens of
    times that amount in predicted profits lost.\n\nThe Innia starbase is reported
    as being in a derelict state after having had its reactor core forcibly ejected
    by a Lai Dai recovery team today. Lai Dai officials have stated that it could
    take as long as three months to return the starbase's laboratory modules to working
    condition. Lai Dai has not revealed the nature of the research."
