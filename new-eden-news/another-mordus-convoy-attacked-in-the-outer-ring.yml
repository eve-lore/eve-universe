- body: "Under attack from NORAD and Imperium forces, a Mordu\u2019s convoy managed
    to evacuate the 4C-B7X station last Thursday.   \n  \nA fleet composed of somewhere
    between 18 and 20 Mordu\u2019s ships and the additional cover of reportedly nearly
    20 freelance pilots travelling in a courier mission to the 4C-B7X system to retrieve
    Legion\u2019s assets met a hostile combined force of NORAD and Imperium vessels.
    \  \n  \nAccording to Mordu\u2019s convoy leader Lt. Amlerik Raun, operatives
    from MC, CAIN, KARN and PIXE provided cover while Legion ships docked, retrieved
    their cargo and left the system. After re-grouping in PF-346 the majority of freelance
    pilots escorted the fleet safely to the Legion\u2019s HQ at 5ZXX-K. The assets
    were reported as highly classified. \u201CWe were not authorized knowledge of
    their nature\u201D, said convoy wingman Lt. Omae Hitimo.   \n  \nThe reasons for
    NORAD and Imperium hostilities towards Mordu\u2019s vessels are not clear at the
    moment. Lt. Raun reported his attackers acted on grounds of supposed territory
    ownership, claiming that neutral vessels were not allowed to fly in or through
    the system. 4C-B7X is under ORE sovereignty.   \n  \nAs reported in early June,
    ORE \u2013 Mordu\u2019s relations turned sour after Mordu\u2019s failed to show
    up to protect and ORE transport thus forcing ORE to request escorting assistance
    to NORAD/Imperium forces in the area, yet it is unknown if this episode was related
    to the recent hostilities.   \n  \nRumours have surfaced this week about Mordus
    and ORE finishing their contract due to the recent tensions, though there has
    been no official confirmation on the subject."
