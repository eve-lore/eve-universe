- body: 'This just in: Rumours of a viral epidemic have been coming from the Hjortur
    system over the last few days, and earlier tonight the Minmatar Republic Security
    Council ordered the system closed and all travellers detained for quarantine and
    mandatory inspection. Pilots in the Metropolis region have been warned to stay
    out of the Hjortur system, as crossing into the system via jumpgate will result
    in immediate webification and detainment by The Minmatar Republic Fleet and Minmatar
    Health Board officials. Those travellers currently quarantined are being expedited
    from the system as swiftly as possible, and hopefully the area will again be declared
    safe for travel sometime over the next twenty-four hours. The epidemic is not
    thought to have spread to any other systems, though there are reports of investigations
    being conducted by health officials in Kisogo, Otenen, Autelen and Nonni. Pilots
    are advised to travel to these locations at their own risk.'
