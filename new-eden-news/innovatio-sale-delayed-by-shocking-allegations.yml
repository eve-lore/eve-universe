- body: "**NEW CALDARI** \\- The acquisition of Innovaatio Varustukset by Ishukone
    Corporation, scheduled for April 11, was derailed by a last minute scandal when
    accusations of underhanded business dealings between the two corporations surfaced.
    The Chief Executive Panel of the Caldari State (CEP) has ordered a temporary halt
    on the sale to begin an inquiry into the matter. \n\nThe trade which was set to
    occur at a ceremony held in station at New Caldari, was almost finalised when
    Kalaakiota Corporation representative Paavo Arto burst into the boardroom, delivering
    an official mandate from the Chief Executive Panel that the transaction be immediately
    postponed. \n\nDetails of the CEP order or the evidence that provoked it have
    not yet been released. Unconfirmed statements from non-official sources have hinted
    that the decision to temporarily halt the merger was based on irregularities they
    found to have occurred in the bidding process, that directly benefited the Ishukone
    Corporation. These allegations are lent weight by the words of Mr. Arto himself,
    who stated to a stunned New Caldari audience: \u201CI have evidence that proves
    that some of the records for the final bids on INNVA were covered from public
    view.\u201D Speculation about the nature of the irregularities behind the CEP
    order has been fuelled primarily by comments made at the press conference prior
    to the aborted signing. \n\nAfter answering several questions about the substantial
    financial benefits offered by the merger, Ishukone representative Martti Vilho
    also potentially implicated Ishukone in an offhand remark that stated: \"Ishukone
    offered many things outside pure ISK that the other mega corporations could not
    offer.\" In the context of the CEP order and statements made at the event by Arto,
    the exact nature of those additional benefits has been called into question. Others
    have defended the remark, claiming that the situation has allowed many to twist
    Mr. Vilho\u2019s words. \n\nThe reaction from many capsuleers present at the ceremony
    varied greatly. Some remained unsurprised by the allegations, deriding Ishukone
    for dishonest business practices and worse. Others claimed that Innovaatio and
    Ishukone were the target of unfair and devious manoeuvres themselves, stating
    that proceedings were being sabotaged by envious Corporations seeking to damage
    reputations and slow the transaction with bureaucratic red tape and political
    mudslinging. The lack of details regarding either the CEP mandate or the evidence
    that supported it\u2019s issuing have only further polarised opinion. \n\nThe
    press conference was the culmination of a heated bidding war between several Caldari
    mega corporations for the small, privately held military development corporation.
    When the final bid was in, Ishukone had obligated themselves to pay 680 billion
    ISK, a final price exceeding most analysts and is now itself being questioned.
    Initially, the size of Ishukone's interest was thought to centre around unconfirmed
    rumours that Innovaatio is currently developing a new cloaking device that would
    allow warp movement during operation; a sure boon to Ishukone given their own
    contracts with the Caldari Navy. Following the scandal in New Caldari however,
    many have said that the surprisingly large final bid was now \u201Cobviously inflated.\u201D\n\nDespite
    the setbacks and allegations, Innovaatio CEO Markku Samuli stated that \"proceedings
    will be cleared up in a few days and the sale will go forward as planned.\" Ishukone
    Corporation CEO Otro Gariushi was unavailable for comment due to his attendance
    at a possibly related CEP meeting."
