- body: "BREAKING NEWS - In a statement made from Caldari Navy Headquarters in Perimeter
    just moments ago, Wing Commander Hikemi Korrado gave details of the largest manhunt
    in the history of the Caldari Navy.\n\nThe announcement comes after the release
    of more information pertaining to the attack in the Mito constellation yesterday
    morning, during which a number of Caldari Navy capital class vessels were hijacked.\n\nKorrado
    confirmed in the statement that those responsible for leading the attack have
    been positively identified as \"a number of officers who were under the command
    of former 37th 'Octopus' Squadron leader Sami Okuuda\" and went on to state that
    \"these are all officers who were dishonorably discharged from Caldari Navy service
    in late February.\"\n\nThe statement also clarified that the Caldari Navy would
    be seeking capsuleer assistance with bringing these former officers to justice,
    and would be offering paid bounties for proof of their execution in the form of
    Pilot License Extensions.\n\nFollowing the press conference, Korrado released
    a list of identities with prices attached to their heads and last known locations,
    along with criteria for payment of bounties, declaring open season on former officers
    now branded \"traitors to the Caldari State.\"\n\nArve Vesren, Director of Operations
    for the Directive Enforcement Department, was swift to back up the release by
    stating that \"any vessels piloted by these individuals will be marked either
    suspect or criminal depending on bounties issued by the Caldari Navy.\"\n\nKorrado
    declined to comment further, simply requesting that the list of fugitives be distributed
    by the interstellar press as widely as possible.\n\nA copy of the bounty listing
