- body: "THE FORGE. The first steps of a new marketing strategy targeting the quality-conscious
    pod-pilots were a success, Strata Corp CEO said. \n\nAs part of a renewed strategy
    to counter the raising pressure from Gallente imports, Caldari high-tech producers
    are increasing exposure of their products among the pod-pilot community, according
    to Strata Corp CEO David Simmons. The New Caldari-based transmitter producer \"has
    engaged in an aggressive marketing campaign to raise consumer awareness of the
    higher quality of Caldari manufacture,\" Mr. Simmons said. \"When quality becomes
    the determining factor for purchase decision, all analyses show that the pod-pilot
    community is the most receptive, always willing to pay a premium for the best
    available products.\" \n\nWhether this is the case for transmitters is a matter
    of debate. \"While I'm unable to speak for the whole Gallente transmitter market,
    let alone the entire Gallente hi-tech market, I can say it is a fact that our
    products have performances similar to any other currently being supplied in the
    State,\" said Anaiolen Oruvei, PR Director of Soullier Laboratories, a Federation-based
    transmitter producer with a substantial presence in Caldari space. \"The product
    in question is highly commoditized, and every product for sale - ours included,
    of course - complies with both State and Federation regulations.\" \n\nSome have
    even argued that Strata Corp's campaign, its holo ads showing their product crushing
    a caricaturized yet recognizable Federation logo along with the slogan \"Caldari:
    it's just better\", seems to be focused not so much on quality as on national
    pride. \"Such accusations are quite obviously down to the frustration of competitors
    that do not understand the Caldari market and the Caldari consumer,\" said Strata
    Corp CFO Jenny Civ. \"Quality is such a defining part of the Caldari spirit that
    saying 'Caldari quality' would be redundant. Of course, a portion of our consumers
    may feel more inclined to purchase a product built in the State, under State-enforced
    labour conditions and complying with the highest standards, than a product of
    dubious origin such as imported ones, where the working conditions can never be
    verified.\" \n\nDebates on nationalism aside, Strata Corp achieved a remarkable
    success in the first steps of their new strategy. Pod-pilots in New Caldari proved
    receptive to SC's campaign, acquiring \"several thousand units\" according to
    Mr. Simmons, who also indicated that the sell figures of this first phase had
    met their strategic goals. \n\n\"This is just the first step,\" said Mr. Simmons.
    \"We will not have the Gallente invading our space unchallenged; in fact, we will
    push ourselves to not only stop them in their tracks, but to reverse the invading
    tide entirely.\""
