- body: "In a surprising turn of events, the Theology Council has stated that it is
    officially investigating the veracity of the claims made by the Order of St. Tetrimon.
    The Suppression Edict is being lifted for a period of two months to allow the
    Tetrimon Order to prepare its case and bring all relevant evidence before the
    Council.   \n  \nDeacon Azir of the Theology Council has said, \"It's put up or
    shut up time for the Tetrimon. Either they support their words with facts, or
    they will be declared heretics. Either way, we will put an end to these lingering
    doubts.\"   \n  \nEsht Pakern, a high-ranking member of the Minmatar Republic
    diplomatic corps, has stated that this announcement is a very worrying one for
    the Minmatar people. \"The Tetrimon are fanatical religious extremists who massacred
    several hundred children without remorse because of their beliefs. The Cultists
    are utterly convinced of the superiority of the Amarr race -- intellectually,
    spiritually, even biologically. The fact that these fanatics are being allowed
    to speak is an insult to to the families of those children.\""
