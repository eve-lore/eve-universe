    'Rabbit' Kosakami, a growing wave of protest has been rising from citizens of
    both the Gallente federation and the Caldari state.   \n  \nDespite the fact that
    there has so far been no evidence of the scientists actually being enslaved by
    the Kor-Azor heir, the demands for their release is getting louder - especially
    on the Gallente side, where people whisper that the president is getting ready
    to propose economic sanctions against Amarr.   \n  \nA few apologists are still
    attempting to whitewash Articio, saying that he might have altruistic motives,
    but they mostly fall on deaf ears. And why wouldn't they - after all, the Amarr
    are well known for their slavery.   \n  \nOf course, there are those who find
    the whole situation more than a little ironic.   \n  \n_\"Finally they agree on
    something. This is rich...the moment someone other than a minmatar is enslaved,
    they all get their panties in a bunch.\"_ said **Muton Sviad** , an agent of the
    Republic fleet. _\"I'm fairly sure the Caldari wouldn't even be bothered at all,
    if it wasn't for the possibility of them missing out on fancy new technologies.
    Don't quote me on that one, by the way.\"_   \n  \nStill no word from the emperor.
    The clock is ticking."
