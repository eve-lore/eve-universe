- body: "**Onward to Glory** \\- On Sunday 20th April we were privileged to be spectators
    at the third ISGC racing league race of Season V. \n\nThere were two main differences
    to this race compared to any other race the league has ever held, the first was
    that for the first time in league history there were two waypoint cans at most
    of the waypoints. \n\nThis caused some confusion amongst the racers at first who
    are not used to having sequential waypoints right next to each other; this also
    made each waypoint a lot more dangerous as it gave any roaming pirate gangs that
    much longer to target and attack. \n\nThe second main difference of this race
    was that it was dedicated to the memory of Mr. Kendar Zek, who passed away in
    his sleep on during the early hours of Friday 18th April. \n\nMr Zek was a well-known
    philanthropist in New Eden, owner of the Venture Racing Team, and one of the main
    sponsors of the Interstellar Gaming Consortium Racing League. His untimely demise
    has caused quite a ripple in the circles where he was known. He was not known
    to be in ill health even by his closest friends, but it would appear from a statement
    made by Mr Zek shortly before he passed on, that he was aware of his situation
    and had made provision for the distribution of his estate and the smooth running
    of his beloved racing team. More information may be found on his last [GalNet](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=751802)
    announcement. \n\nIt is fitting that this race, in remembrance of Mr Zek, was
    once again dominated by Takashi Karasuwo ex-manager, now owner of the Venture
    Racing Team. Mr Karasuwo has been unstoppable for the last couple seasons, and
    even among the racers he is known as the best and fastest, in fact he is so good
    that you cannot place a bet on him to win as the bookmaker that deals with the
    racing league does not feel that Mr Karasuwo could possibly lose. \n\nAll the
    teams are looking strong this season and we are looking forward to a possible
    change in the finishing order in the next couple of races. \n\n* * *\n\nThe next
    race is set to take place in the Everyshore region on Sunday 27th April starting
    at 20:00. \n\n* * *\n\n_External GalNet References_  \nKendar Zek - Final Broadcast
