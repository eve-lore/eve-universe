- body: 'MOLDEN HEATH - According to reports from Republic law enforcement, the Angel
    Cartel has begun to experience a downturn in fortune within Molden Heath from
    a combination of cloned mercenaries, Thukker Tribe assets, and elements of the
    Republic Fleet. While the Thukker Tribe and Republic Fleet have been active in
    Molden Heath for years, the newly settled cloned mercenaries have enabled them
    to refocus their operations.


    The region has seen a sharp drop in violent crime and booster-related trafficking
    in the days since the mercenaries have arrived. The Republic Fleet and Thukker
    Tribe have diverted assets from their planetside installations, which have mostly
    been taken over by mercenary corporations, and have redirected them toward interdiction
    of Cartel assets in space.


    Experts have expressed cautious optimism about the results. "It seems likely that
    the Cartel will be hard pressed to continue with the same tactics they always
    have," said one law enforcement official. "However, it must be said these are
    early results. The Cartel is likely being cautious and is reading the situation.
    They are well known as adaptable. We cannot simply celebrate this as a permanent
    success. And once the mercenaries begin fighting each other heavily, who knows
    what the Cartel will do?


    The Republic has released a statement saying, "The Tribal Assembly supports the
    rights of the Thukker Tribe to do with their territories as they please. We are
    currently satisfied with the situation in Molden Heath."'
