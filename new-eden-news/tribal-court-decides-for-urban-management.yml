    - Today, in a split decision, the Vherokior tribal court sided with Urban Management
    in the case of _Hagori v. Urban Management_ , effectively ending Oguko Hagori's
    attempt to reclaim lands on Trytedald III. Previously owned by his family prior
    to the Minmatar Rebellion, the land had been confiscated by the Republic government
    and had been returned to public use.\n\nAs many had suspected, the decision in
    the case hinged on whether or not the the land was considered abandoned. The Vherokior
    court pointed to the lack of any claim by Hagori's family since the Rebellion,
    citing it as evidence that the family had relinquished their claims. While Hagori
    maintained that the de facto state of war between the Mandate and the Republic
    made such claims, even if they had been filed, unlikely to be acknowledged, the
    court decided that the fact there was not even an attempt to do so was in effect
    a relinquishment of the family's right to the land.\n\nAt the moment, what that
    means for the many other similar lawsuits is unclear; however, most legal scholars
    agree that the decision raises the bar for further attempts by Nefantar immigrants
    to reclaim previously held property in the Republic. Nefantar tribal leaders have
    so far been silent, a move seen by many parliamentary insiders as an attempt to
    avoid such a hot-button issue with the pending tribal assembly closing in."
