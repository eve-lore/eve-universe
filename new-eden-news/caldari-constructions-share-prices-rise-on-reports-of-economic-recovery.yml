    Constructions) stock saw an uptick following reports that it has broken even on
    operations for the first time in four years. The corporation had been posting
    small losses under the executorship of [Tibus Heth](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tibus
    Heth) which, while not as significant as those of [Kaalakiota Corporation](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Kaalakiota
    Corporation), had still put stress on the company.


    Following the report, Caldari Constructions also released a statement saying it
    has completed the nullification of Tibus Heth''s stake in the company and will
    begin a public offering on his reclaimed shares. The sudden availability of the
    large number of shares is expected to stall, or even reverse, the gain, but analysts
    also expect this to be a short term dip in an anticipated upward trend of Caldari
    Constructions shares.


    Finally, the corporation has indicated it will initiate a leadership vote for
    a new CEO pending the public offering. Several upper level executives with the
    corporation are considered top candidates, including CFO Tamo Heinulaila, Business
    Development Director Onnuta Ahvala, and CMO Korada Shutsu.'
