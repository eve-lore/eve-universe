- body: "Amarrian slave traders Imperial Human Resources announced today that they
    will no longer be conducting business with pod pilots. The decision comes after
    a series of violent attacks on IHR shipping orchestrated by the Brutor Freedom
    Front and their leader Alger Skaven.   \n  \nSpeaking from his office in Sharhelund,
    IHR CEO Malachi Bolden stated that the decision was made after \u201Cmuch deliberation
    and prayer\u201D following his corporation\u2019s failure to pacify Skaven in
    The Bleak Lands last week. On December 7th, Bolden\u2019s fleet of warships made
    an attempt to capture Skaven\u2019s capsule in Kourmonen. The fleet, which consisted
    of five Apocalypse-class battleships and four smaller escort craft, was met by
    the Brutor Freedom Front and nearly thirty representatives from the capsuleer
    alliances Electus Matari and Fimbulwinter, among others. IHR forces lost all nine
    of their ships in the proceeding battle.   \n  \nDuring the course of the press
    conference, Bolden repeatedly emphasized the insignificance of his corporation\u2019s
    recent losses, claiming they alone did not influence IHR\u2019s newest move. \u201CIt
    is true that Skaven and his band of terrorist scum have made business difficult
    for my company over the past few weeks,\u201D he said, \u201Cbut I would like
    to assure our loyal customers and shareholders that the Brutor Freedom Front has
    not so much as made a dent in our overall gross earnings.\u201D   \n  \nWhen asked
    about [continued accusations](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=436217&page=1#4)
    of illegal slave trade made by several Minmatar pod pilots on GalNet, Bolden responded:
    \u201Cthe terrorists cannot hope to justify any attack made on our peaceful trade
    vessels. Imperial Human Resources operates under perfectly legal circumstances
    and we consider our business bound by all laws and regulations enforced by CONCORD.\u201D
    \  \n  \n\u201COver the past month we have seen an alarming increase in the amount
    of reported terrorist activity in and around our area of operation,\u201D he said.
    \u201CMy own experiences with the Brutor Freedom Front and their supporters certainly
    seem to reinforce such statistics. If the situation continues to decline, my humble
    enterprise will begin to encounter substantial self-defense and logistics issues
    that we are not currently prepared to face.\u201D Bolden punctuated his final
    statements by claiming that his corporation\u2019s new policy was \u201Cnot a
    sign of cowardice but rather a precautionary measure.\u201D   \n  \nIHR shares
    fell 1.4% following the announcement. The corporation first started selling slaves
    to pod pilots six weeks ago."
