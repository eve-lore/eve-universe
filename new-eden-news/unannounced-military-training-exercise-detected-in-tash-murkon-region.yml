- body: 'Tash-Murkon - Approximately 200 Amarrian warships were detected moving through
    the Tash-Murkon Region earlier today in what is being described by analysts as
    a training exercise by the Imperial Fleet. Although no official statement has
    been released by the Ministry of War, the movement of such a large number of purely
    Amarr-class vessels "could be nothing else" according to military strategists
    familiar with Imperial Navy operations.


    The Tash-Murkon family spokesman expressed concern over the developments. "We
    have not been informed of any exercises by the Ministry of War," he said. "We
    would like to think they would have the courtesy to inform us before moving such
    a large number of ships through our space."'
