    Artois Chermoul claimed the [Minmatar Republic](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Minmatar)
    has been guilty of "spreading discontent within the [Federation](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente)".
    In the middle of a speech about Federal trade policies, the former colonel with
    the Federal Marines went on to call the Republic "untrustworthy" and a "security
    threat".


    "We have seen the Republic engage in increasingly belligerent behavior," Chermoul
    said. "In response to minor incidents within the Federation, the Republic has
    tacitly endorsed violence against Gallente. We''ve already seen them undertake
    military incursions against our borders. They have engaged in vandalism and disturbing
    the peace whenever the Federal government takes some action that does not appease
    their minority."


    He went on to say, "Even when things go their way, they have spread violence,"
    referring to the disturbances that broke out following the acquittal of Kinhar
    Elokur. Police are currently charging twelve Gallente and eight Minmatar with
    disturbing the peace and inciting riots in relation to those incidents.


    The anti-Republic sentiments drew scattered but vocal cheers from the audience,
    in contrast to the universal but more muted applause occurring during other points
    in the speech.'
