- body: "The two leading scientists in the Crielere program, the Gallentean Henric
    Touvolle and the Caldari Taromi Umailen, have publicly called for unity amongst
    their fellow scientists following the stunning revelations that top Caldari officials
    have systematically been stealing blueprints from the Crielere facilities. Many
    of the most prominent scientists in the program have since left their posts and
    gone to work for independent research firms elsewhere. Now Touvolle and Umailen,
    which pioneered the Crielere program in the first place, are asking the remaining
    scientists to stick with it despite the internal turmoil and lack of funding.
    \ \n  \nIt seems unlikely that the plea from the two visionary scientists will
    suffice to save the Crielere program, which is on the brink of collapsing completely.
    Touvolle and Umailen have vowed to continue their work to the very end 'for the
    sake of humanity as a whole to progress to the next level', as they put it. Though
    their dedication and radicalism managed to build the greatest science think-tank
    in human history, it is difficult to see it survive without the support of the
    empires. Yet only time can tell."
