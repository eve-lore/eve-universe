- body: "Late last night, a freelance trader named Kerio Ekoena was spotted in the
    Nonni system, buying slaves, drugs, firearms and a whole host of other illegal
    goods, showing that the rumour mill can occasionally hold the unvarnished truth.
    \  \n  \nWorking for a third party corporation, he is suspected to have spent
    millions obtaining the contraband items they require. Who he is fronting for is
    still the object of wide speculation. Astonishingly though, it is believed that
    a trader by the name of Jashira Ne\xB4rgha of Galactic Trading and Logistics,
    a reputable Gallente firm, was present amongst the smugglers selling large quantities
    of contraband items on behalf of her corporation.   \n  \nWith the trading taking
    place in a system with supposed Concord presence, some more publicly concerned
    citizens have cried for an answer as to why they didn\u2019t intervene. So far
    Concord public relations officials have declined to comment."
