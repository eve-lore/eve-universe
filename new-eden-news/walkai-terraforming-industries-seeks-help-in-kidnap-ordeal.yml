- body: "In a statement today, a spokesman for Walkai Terraforming Industries issued
    a request to the capsuleer community for information leading to the safe return
    of one of its lead scientists - reported missing last month.   \n  \nSpeaking
    on behalf of WTI CEO Kentanen Koimota, the spokesman stated that he was less than
    impressed with Concord\u2019s investigations thus far.   \n  \nConcord officials
    still maintain that the WTI scientist is simply \u201Cmissing\u201D despite numerous
    appeals from Mr. Koimota to treat the scientist\u2019s disappearance as suspicious.
    \  \n  \nThe spokesman went on to report that Koimota had made use of several
    unofficial contacts to acquire the following list of individuals thought to be
    involved in the scientist\u2019s disappearance.   \n  \nEverard Yrton  \nMoy Ygmot
    \ \nJorler Teauxt  \nAyst Otradik  \nDefone Ashtornt   \n  \nKentanen Koimota
    is said to have requested that pilots keep a lookout for these individuals and
    report any sightings to him; expressing his desire that pilots encountering these
    individuals should avoid engaging them in combat as they risk destroying vital
    information as to the whereabouts of the missing scientists   \n  \nWhen asked
    what Walkai Terraforming Industries planned to do with this information, the spokesman
    added \u201Cwe need to know the location, activities, and the kind of craft these
    people are piloting so that we can plan our response\u201D."
