- body: "The Gallente Federation have, earlier this morning, responded positively
    to a plea for assistance from Gallente citizen Mera Vahlsina regarding her missing
    partner. This plea was reiterated [via the public GalNet](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=637362&page=1#6)
    after repeated unsuccessful attempts to gain information from CONCORD regarding
    her partner, Captain Bethol Jan Kozer. Captain Kozer was officially declared missing
    in action on the 3rd of this month by CONCORD. Frustrated at the lack of progress,
    and having generated a mix of public sympathy and scorn in her previous GalNet
    appeals, Ms Vahlsina\u2019s appeal to her government for assistance in gaining
    information has now been answered. The Gallente Federation statement, issued from
    the office of the Gallente CONCORD delegation, had this to say. \n\n\u201COur
    concern for our citizens has always been a high priority for us. We will seek
    to resolve this issue via our representatives to the CONCORD Assembly as quickly
    as possible, and allow Ms Vahlsina the peace of mind and closure she deserves.\u201D
    \n\nWhen asked for comment in response to her government\u2019s pledge of assistance,
    Ms Vahlsina restated her suspicions regarding Commander Rhatal\u2019s retirement.
    \n\n\u201CThere is obviously something more going on here.\u201D She stated strongly.
    \u201CI simply will not sit down and continue to be ignored while having my intelligence
    insulted by the likes of bureaucrats and bloated Admirals. Nor will I be patronised
    by them with former Commander Rhatal as their obvious puppet.\u201D \n\nA statement
    from CONCORD regarding the Gallente Federation involvement is expected in the
    coming days."
