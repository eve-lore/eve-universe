- body: "SAFIZON - In a statement released this morning, the Imperial Navy claimed
    that loyalist capsuleer assistance has allowed naval research and development
    staff to achieve the first in what is likely to be a series of breakthroughs involving
    Sleeper technology.\n\nSpeaking during a press conference from Imperial Navy headquarters,
    Admiral Ren Karetta declared that \"assistance from a number of sources within
    the capsuleer loyalist bloc has allowed us to make further advancements in downsizing
    Sleeper derived technologies in order to apply them to a lighter hull than the
    strategic cruiser platforms.\"\n\nAdmiral Karetta elaborated further on the breakthrough,
    commenting that \"as it stands, thanks to the diligence and support of capsuleer
    organizations loyal to the Empire, this breakthrough has shed light on potential
    applications for more compact tracking and hardpoint technologies that may be
    suitable for a new tactical destroyer class hull.  \n\n\"With the assistance of
    those in service of the Amarr Empire, in particular Admiral Ascentior of Praetoria
    Imperialis Excubitoris [PIE] and his fellow pilots, our research and development
    staff are poised to make further breakthroughs in several fields in the coming
    weeks,\" continued Admiral Karetta.\n\nAfter completing his address, Admiral Karetta
    handed the floor to Grand Admiral Kezti Sundara, Commander in Chief of the Imperial
    Navy, who reiterated the gratitude of the Navy, saying \"today, the Empire shares
    with the rest of the cluster, its pride in the strength of those who choose to
    serve her cause, and the cause of God. It gives me immense pride to grant the
    honorary rank of Fabricator-General of the Imperial Navy to Admiral [Ascentior](https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Ascentior)
    of [Praetoria Imperialis Excubitoris](https://gate.eveonline.com/Alliance/Praetoria%20Imperialis%20Excubitoris),
    for his diligence and devotion to duty as a subject of God and Empire.\"\n\nIn
    the wake of the announcement, the Scope Galactic News Network has received reports
    from several unconfirmed sources that a short notice meeting of the CONCORD Assembly's
    Inner Circle has been called, apparently to discuss the implications of further
    weaponization of Sleeper derived technologies."
