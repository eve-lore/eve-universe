- body: 'Leremblompes, Everyshore - An official spokesman for the Federal Intelligence
    Office yesterday announced that the investigation of last month''s Federal Freight
    break-in has become a national security matter, from now on placed under the exclusive
    purview of the FIO itself. Local authorities previously responsible for investigating
    the crime have been sidelined, with agents of the Special Department of Internal
    Investigations (the so-called "Black Eagles") commandeering all the evidence,
    files, and investigative materials produced to date.


    The move was undertaken following the disclosure of Federal Freight personnel
    that they could not vouch for the integrity of their data storage systems during
    the break-in. The number of Federation Navy supply contracts held by Federal Freight
    at the time of the break-in, coupled with the recent increase in offensive operations
    undertaken by the Caldari, has led to speculation that the break-in was motivated
    by espionage, rather than by vandalism as was initially suspected. The Federation
    Navy has suspended all contracts with Federal Freight until more information is
    brought to light.


    While the FIO spokesman would not comment on the matter directly, unnamed sources
    within the government have indicated that several Federal Freight employees are
    now classified as "persons of interest" in the investigation.  Federal Freight
    spokesman Michel Gevault has issued a statement that the company is "doing everything
    in its power to cooperate with the FIO."  That reassurance did little for investors,
    however, as news of the Navy''s contract suspensions sent the company''s stock
    price tumbling.'
