    of Ammatar Consulate Governor Ana Utulf\u2019s urgings to defect filtered across
    the cluster. Expecting a bloody confrontation with the Ammatar to free their once-lost
    tribe, there was widespread shock as reports stated an overwhelming lack of resistance.\n\n\"I
    can\u2019t believe it,\" said Bhane Karemi, one of the many hundreds of thousands
    of Matari now filling the streets of cities across the Republic. \"I can\u2019t
    say I trust these reports, and I bet I\u2019m not alone in that. They\u2019re
    probably buying time until the Amarr arrive..\" Reactions to the invasion remain
    mixed, confusion still reigns about the composition of the force, and no one seems
    to have any idea who\u2019s leading the fleet. Some are already celebrating what
    they see as the return of their people and others simply confused as they watch
    news feeds eagerly for more information.\n\nPosted 13:34 GMT"
