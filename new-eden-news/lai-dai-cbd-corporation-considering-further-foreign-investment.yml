- body: "Jita \u2013 Financial newsmagazine _The Kimotoro Report_ is reporting that
    two of the eight Caldari megacorporations are considering increasing their stakes
    in a number of foreign markets as a hedge against the faltering State economy.
    The Lai Dai Corporation and CBD Corporation, already heavily invested in a number
    of foreign markets, were reported to be in \"high-level discussions regarding
    foreign acquisitions and trade contracts,\" and that the recent spate of profit
    warnings has \"troubled many in the executive offices\" of the two corporate giants.
    \n\nAccording to the article, Lai Dai, which already has a minority stake in the
    Carthum Conglomerate, is considering expanding its holdings in the Amarr corporation.
    The news brought about a small jump in the share price of the Conglomerate, with
    speculators hoping to cash in on a buyout. With Carthum's annual shareholder meeting
    coming up soon, this has generated rumors of an attempt by Lai Dai not only insulate
    themselves from the Caldari economy but also gain more influence over the Amarr
    concern's board. \n\nLai Dai has denied the report, saying that the article was
    based on \"rumors and hearsay.\" \"There has been no move by Lai Dai to increase
    our stake in the Carthum Conglomerate, and we encourage investors to look carefully
    at the true motivations for the report, coming as they do from a Nugoeihuvi-owned
    publication,\" said their chief spokesman, Haalonen Ihoya. \n\nReaction has been
    quick in coming from the Empire, with sources in the Amarr Trade Registry reporting
    that several of the noble houses have put pressure on the ATR to investigate the
    rumors. According to these sources, the prospect of one of the Empire's largest
    aerospace and heavy industry concerns becoming more tightly linked to the State
    than it already is has been called an \"imperial security matter\" and some in
    the Empire are worried that this will expose the corporation to the weakness in
    the Caldari economy. For its part, the Carthum Corporation itself has declined
    to comment on the matter. \n\nMeanwhile, the _Report_ also claims that the CBD
    Corporation, long the largest importer/exporter in the State, is quietly floating
    plans to move into \"marginal\" markets of the cluster, such as the Intaki Syndicate,
    Trust Partners, and ORE. According to sources in the company, these areas \"present
    considerable growth opportunity\" and \"a lack of constraining financial regulation.\"
    The memo states that security concerns are \"a possible issue,\" but that they
    can be dealt with through \"adequate financial incentives to local militias.\"
    \n\nThe Caldari megacorporations have long considered most of these areas to be
    unprofitable or too politically sensitive to become involved with. CBD has a history
    of high-risk, high-yield venture taking, however, and many analysts believe that
    the current downturn is likely to encourage that behavior if it continues. Sources
    within the Caldari Business Tribunal, however, are quietly concerned that movement
    into such markets may bring more scrutiny on the State from the Secure Commerce
    Commission, a particularly sore subject in the wake of recent CONCORD involvement
    in the State, such as the Itsukame Innovations case. \n\n\"Organized crime, especially
    the Serpentis and Angels organizations, is so imbedded into what little semblance
    of government and administration there is out there that it will be nearly impossible
    for CBD to maintain distance from them,\" said Irine Otomo, professor of periphery
    state studies at the School of Applied Knowledge. \"CBD is treading a fine line;
    while it could potentially pay off, there's always the chance it could backfire.
    The Tribunal is extremely touchy about such matters in the wake of the recent
    SCC allegations.\" \n\nThe CBD Corporation declined to comment on the matter,
    refusing to confirm or deny the validity of the leak, but so far _The Kimotoro
    Report_ has stood by both stories, claiming that it has \"reliable sources\" in
    the upper echelons of both corporations that confirm the reports. Though the _Report_
    has often been the first to break such stories before, the newsmagazine was rocked
    by scandal last year when one of its junior editors was convicted of stock market
    manipulation by the CBT. As a result, many investors are waiting to see the story
    confirmed elsewhere before making any significant moves in the market."
