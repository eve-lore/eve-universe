- body: 'BREAKING NEWS  -The Federal Intelligence Office has released a statement
    to confirm that a massive surface offensive has begun against the Provist occupation
    force on Caldari Prime.


    The announcement comes just moments after all communication with the surface of
    Caldari Prime was lost abruptly for the second time today, and the cities of Pakuri
    and Tovil were plunged into darkness as entire electrical grids have apparently
    been shut down.


    Since the release, made by Federal Intelligence Office Director Mentas Blaque,
    wild speculation on the identity of the organization responsible for the offensive
    has begun to flood various media outlets after the FIO neglected to name those
    responsible. At this time there is a complete communications lockdown in place,
    with no reported flow of information between the surface and the Caldari Navy
    defense fleet that sits in low orbit.


    A number of military tactics experts have indicated that the shutdown of communications
    may have been undertaken to render the Caldari orbital fleet unable to provide
    orbital support without reliable coordinates, and if so, the move may be the precursor
    to a full scale surface invasion of Caldari Prime.


    A number of explosions large enough to be seen from low orbit have been reported
    around the city of Pakuri, and an entire battalion of combat dropships is reported
    to have been dispatched to the area by the orbiting Caldari Navy support fleet.'
