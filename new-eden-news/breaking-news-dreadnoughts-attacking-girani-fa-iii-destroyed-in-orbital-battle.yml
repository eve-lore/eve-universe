    an orbital strike on the planet of Girani-Fa III has been destroyed by the combined

    III is under enhanced security lockdown with no communications possible with the
    surface through civilian channels. Scans of the planet are reportedly showing
    a number of subsurface energy readings suggesting the activation of underground
    shielding, and possibly surface-to-orbit weapons and active defenses.\n\nPresident
    Celes Aguard has personally issued a statement disavowing the involvement of her
    government in the incident and ordered a full investigation into the activities
    of the Crux Special Tasks Group by the Federal Intelligence Office. Federal Navy
    units are reported to have raised their alert status but have been ordered to
    maintain ready status only.\n\nAuthorities across the Amarr Empire are invoking
    security lockdowns and a number of Royal and Major Houses have invoked wartime
    status for their fief troops. Reports from several heavily-populated Amarr planets
    indicate slave districts are being sealed and police troops rushed to key positions
    to forestall the threat of rebellion.\n\n**BREAKING! BREAKING! BREAKING!**\n\n
