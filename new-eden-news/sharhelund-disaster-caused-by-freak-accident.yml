- body: "The investigation into the crash on Sharhelund III has made its conclusions
    public earlier today. The release of the deadly plague virus on Sharhelund III
    was caused by a crash between a battleship carrying the virus and a shuttle in
    orbit of the planet.\n\nObbet Rember from the Republic Justice Department states
    that the Restless Spirit was a rebuild battleship and that this played a large
    part in the \u201Cfreak\u201D accident. The accident was caused by an orbital
    shuttle which, due to navigational error crashed into the Restless Spirit as it
    was doing a supply run to the planet. Normally battleships are able to withstand
    crashes and bumps but the Restless Spirit was rebuilt and standard engineers could
    not perform their maintenance duties on the altered design. The lack of regular
    maintenance had weakened the battleship because small fractures and similar damage
    went overlooked. \n\nThe shuttle which was in orbit of the planet had not adjust
    his flight plan in time to dodge the battleship that came to replenish supplies
    on Sharhelund III. The pilot of the Restless Spirit followed normal protocol when
    he contacted the shuttle to make way for the battleship. What followed was a crash
    between the two ships that left a wreck for the investigating team to dissect.
    The Republic Justice Department has closed the investigation being satisfied with
    their answers regarding the crash that had cost close to 3 million lives.\n\nThe
    accident on Sharhelund has provoked the sympathy of all citizens and the aid people
    gave was overwhelming for the official authorities. Obbet Rember will give a personal
    letter of recommendation from the Justice Department to pilots who helped the
    inhabitants of Sharhelund or the investigating authorities."
