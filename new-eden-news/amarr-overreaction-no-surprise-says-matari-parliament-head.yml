- body: "Head of Republic Parliament Malaetu Shakor yesterday commented on the Amarr
    Empire's reactions to Matari splinter group attacks in the Bleak Lands these past
    weeks, calling the Amarrians' response a gross overreaction, but an unsurprising
    one.   \n  \nIn an interview with news outlet The Scope, Shakor expressed his
    belief that Imperial Chamberlain Dokuta Karsoth's hand had been \"forced by egotism\"
    into \"doing whatever was necessary to salvage the Bleak Lands situation.\" This
    is in reference to the steady ramping up of forces within the Bleak Lands areas
    within the past week, a move widely believed to be in response to a recent deluge
    of media reports about Karsoth's lack of control over the Amarr Navy, which peaked
    with the destruction of an Amarrian battlestation roughly three weeks ago.   \n
    \ \nThe party responsible for most of the attacks is a radical organization known
    as the Defiants, a Matari splinter group composed of ex-Republic Fleet personnel
    and led by much-decorated ex-Republic Fleet Captain Karishal Muritor. The group
    has reportedly been pushed back from the Bleak Lands after a large influx of Amarrian
    forces to the area resulted in significant skirmish losses for them.   \n  \nChamberlain
    Karsoth, meanwhile, has been exerting a great deal of diplomatic pressure on the
    Republic to rein in these undesirable elements. Accusations of Republic funding
    have repeatedly entered the discussion, with the Republic issuing vigorous denials
    every time.   \n  \nInside sources confirm that relations between the two nations
    are at a lower point than they have been at for a long time.   \n  \n\"There's
    definitely a chill in the air,\" stated a top-level Matari aide who wished to
    remain anonymous. \"They [the Chamberlain's representatives] are so dead-set on
    our guilt that they seem unwilling to listen to reason.\"   \n  \nCommenting on
    the situation, Shakor said, \"Even though I have a great deal of personal sympathy
    with the cause of my old friend Muritor, I cannot say I see the sense - diplomatic
    or military - in our Republic endorsing these raids. As our spokesmen have already
    stated on numerous occasions, the Republic Fleet has dismissed all of these personnel
    long ago. Any speculation that they are linked to us at this point in time is
    tenuous at best.\""
