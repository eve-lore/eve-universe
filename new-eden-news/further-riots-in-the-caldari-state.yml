    areas.\n\nArmed mobs of substantial numbers had taken to the streets in a clear
    threat to the local status quo, with the ringleaders having identified Kisogo
    as their focus where the fighting has been at its most fierce. \n\nA rapid response
    was prepared by the local Megacorporations and the Navy Security Forces and the
    rioting was eventually suppressed at the cost of numerous lives, reported to total
    in the thousands. Many of these are believed to be unfortunate civilians, caught
    up in the riot. \n\nEyewitness reports that armed citizens chanted anti-State
    rhetoric and demanded power for the people, whilst others clamoured for the resignation
    of alleged corrupt officials. \n\nShortly before the first riot erupted, State
    officials revealed that Melarius Torvil, the leader of the Brothers of Freedom,
    sent them a message stating: _\u201CThe enemies of the Caldari have shown themselves
    to be within the State, they have refused to stand down peacefully, so now we
    will put them down.\u201D_\n\nIn response to the riots, Caldari officials have
    been quick to declare the Brothers of Freedom as an \u2018enemy of the State\u2019
    and issued warrants for the arrest of its leaders. In a news conference civic
    leaders pleaded: _\u201CThat all citizens should remain alert\u201D and that the
    \u201CCaldari Navy has been tasked with the bringing down of the organizations
    and shall bring it's ringleaders to justice.\u201D_\n\nThe pacification operation
    is believed to be led by Caldari Navy\u2019s Commander Jurensai."
