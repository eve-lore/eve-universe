- body: 'VILLORE - The Gallente Senate announced the results of yesterday''s internal
    election for a new Head Senator this morning, after the 24 hour voting period
    came to a close. Renvieve Jolousse, interim head Senator for the last 10 days
    and head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, formally confirmed the results
    via press release a little over an hour ago.


    Stepping up from her position as leader of the Senate''s Domestic Security Council,
    Senator Andon Gardieu will assume the role of Head Senator, formally known as
    ''Speaker of the Chamber'', this evening when she is sworn in during a special
    ceremony by Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Broyal Alserette.


    The announcement has so far been met with extremely positive public sentiment,
    with this being the first time in almost a century that a female Head Senator
    has been elected. Speaking to the press from her family residence on Villore IV,
    the 67 year old former servicewoman, who spent 26 years with the Federation Navy,
    expressed her delight at the result and offered her most "sincere gratitude for
    the support shown by the people of the Federation".


    Her inauguration ceremony this evening is expected to be attended by President
    Jacus Roden, Black Eagles Director Mentas Blaque, and Senator Gardieu''s former
    commanding officer with the Federation Navy, Admiral Auvier Bauvon.


    It was also announced in the same press release that Gilles Ranchel, nephew of
    the Federation Navy''s Grand Admiral will assume Senator Gardieu''s position as
    leader of the Senate''s Domestic Security Council.'
