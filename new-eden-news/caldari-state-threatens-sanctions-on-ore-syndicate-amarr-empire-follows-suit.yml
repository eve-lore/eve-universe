- body: "Officials from the Caldari Executive Panel yesterday morning released a statement
    wherein it was indicated that the Caldari State might impose severe sanctions
    on the ORE Syndicate, should the Syndicate not back down from its declared intention
    to release moon mining equipment and starbase materials into SCC markets later
    this month.  According to the statement, \u201CThe ORE Syndicate and its administration
    have shown no willingness to accommodate the Caldari State nor its neighbors in
    our wish for galactic stability, both economic and militaristic.\u201D In an official
    statement from the Imperial Chancellor\u2019s Office just three hours later, the
    Amarr Empire declared that it placed its full support behind the actions of the
    Caldari State, prompting speculations that they would follow suit sometime in
    the next few days.  The news has sent shockwaves through the stock markets, with
    some investors seeing this as the end of the ORE Syndicate, others seeing it as
    the beginning of a new era in its history. ORE officials remain mysteriously unruffled
    by the news; no comment has been forthcoming so far, but an unofficial source
    stated founder Orion Mashel was \u201Cin repose at his home, unperturbed by bristling
    monoliths.\u201D  The Syndicate\u2019s nonchalant reaction has led to discussion
    on whether the defiant stance taken by the notorious Curse Alliance early last
    month with regards to the incident at one of the State\u2019s COLOSSUS qualifier
    races, where two pilots were shot down and pod-killed by a CA member, may have
    been the first indication of a subtle power shift in the galactic political arena.
    Analysts, journalists and social speculants have wondered aloud whether the old
    empires may be slowly giving ground to a new world order of sorts \u2013 according
    to State Beacon journalist Kisasen Purukai, \u201Ca pure meritocracy where survival
    is dictated by the strongest and the cleverest, and the importance of pure racial
    boundaries takes a back seat to the importance of shared goals and common interests.
    It comes as little surprise that Mr. Mashel, shrewd businessman that he is, realizes
    that these are the people he wants to do business with.\u201D  The Gallente Federation
    and the Minmatar Republic are reportedly on the fence at the time of going to
    press, neither nation having given an official response. Fevered debates are reported
    to be taking place within the Federal Senate, and the Republic\u2019s Tribal Council
    has convened four times within the last forty-eight hours. Statements are expected
    from these nations very soon."
