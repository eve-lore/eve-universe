- body: 'Pator - Sanmatar Shakor and the Republic Tribal Chiefs will host a meeting
    with Ennar Aeboul, Chief of the Thukker Tribe, it was announced at a press conference
    today.


    Shakor was short on details, stating that the goal was to "promote goodwill between
    the tribes of the Republic and our Thukker brethren after a long period of misunderstanding
    between our people," and that he hoped Chief Aeboul''s visit would be productive
    for both factions.


    When asked about the Thukker Chief''s arrival date on Matar, Shakor surprised
    the assembled press by saying that he had arrived this morning, adding "I hope
    the nation will join me in showing Chief Aeboul our warmest welcome. It has been
    far too long."


    This move comes after a general upswing in relations between the Thukkers and
    the Republic, following their near non-existence before the Minmatar invasion
    of Amarr.'
