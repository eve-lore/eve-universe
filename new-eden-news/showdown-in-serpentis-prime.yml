- body: "A duel between the Serpentis Corporation and Ryan Routine was fought in the
    Serpentis Prime system earlier this week. The contest, won by the Serpentis, quietened
    any speculation that the corporation did not still have its sharp edges. \n\nThe
    duel between Admiral Rembran of the Serpentis Corporation and Ryan Routine of
    Cataclysm Enterprises within the G Alliance had been initiated by a request from
    Mr. Routine to battle Salvador Sarpati. Sarpati, CEO of the Serpentis Corporation,
    currently holds the ill-favored and sometime-coveted spot of the most wanted man
    in the known universe, with a bounty of 1.184 billion isk. \n\nThe battle lasted
    approximately eight minutes before the Machariel piloted by Mr. Routine exploded
    under the attack of Admiral Rembran\u2019s Vindicator. Loosely organized betting
    pools gathered over 300 participants, with less than fifty-percent expecting the
    Serpentis to win. \n\nMr. Routine said that he had originally planned to fight
    CEO Sarpati, but due to internal Serpentis politics the duel had been arranged
    with Admiral Rembran instead. Mr. Routine also commented that \u201CThis was the
    most exciting duel I\u2019ve ever had.\u201D \n\nAn earlier incident involving
    the loss of a Moros had set the Admiral at odds with his CEO. Even in victory,
    doubts remained: \u201CNo. I don't know if I'll ever look alright in Sarpati's
    eyes. At least I know I'm keeping my position. But one of these days, I'm going
    to get my revenge on those meatbags who destroyed my ship.\u201D"
