- body: "The outer rim regions of space have traditionally been hotly contested by
    not only empires, but corporations and pirates aswell. Venal is no different in
    this regard, especially not recently. \n\nApproximately 3 weeks ago, pirates from
    the infamous M3G4 pirate organization started making incursions into Venal. These
    incursions were intensified the following week with more numbers pouring in armed
    with increasingly more advanced and powerful weaponry. \n\nM3G4 are a part of
    the Northern Alliance, which is also home to Taggart Transdimensional (TTI), who
    are believed to supply M3G4 with the resources to carry on their incursions into
    the Venal region's primary authority's territory. That of the New Venal Alliance
    (NVA). \n\nIn case you're confused as to why this alliance is indeed called 'new',
    it is because of it's short but unsettling history. \n\nTaggart was once part
    of the Venal Alliance, a vast organization which extended it's dominion over the
    whole of the region. It's war with the Fountain regional alliance was not going
    in it's favor, and alternative strategies were desperately needed in order to
    turn the tide of the war. \n\nThe Fountain alliance, chiefly being interested
    in the Taggart Transdimensional corporation, demanded the expulsion of said corporation
    from the Venal alliance. In response, the VA member corporations held a vote,
    to remove TTI from the alliance ranks in order to buy time for the war effort,
    or, as some contrary opinions go, to barter for complete peace. \n\nThe vote went
    in the favor of TTI, and it was decided that the war would continue with TTI still
    in the alliance. Immediately following this vote however, a prepared statement
    from TTI's management denounced the alliance representatives, resulting in a second
    vote to be held which expelled TTI from the alliance, taking several allies with
    them. \n\nSince then a state of war has existed between TTI and allies on the
    one hand, and the remainder of the Venal alliance on the other. \n\n_\"This war
    has been thrust upon us by no choice of our own, this is a war on behalf of the
    common people. Should our enemies prevail, it will mean the end of democracy in
    the Venal region\",_ said Athule Snanm, prominent member of the Jericho Fraction,
    by large the public face of the NVA. \n\nWhich brings us to the present situation,
    with M3G4 incursions recently having been taken up again in the region. \n\nTTI
    have supplied the attackers with a base of operations in the area, from which
    the incursions are staged further into the region, operating through the traditional
    pirate model of electronic warfare, using mainly Caldari Blackbird cruisers with
    battleship's supplying raw firepower. \n\nExact losses are unknown, though NVA
    authorities claim that losses on NVA side number 14 battleship class vessels and
    just under 20 cruisers, it further claims to have downed 21 TTI battleships with
    over 31 cruiser and frigate kills. \n\nThough trading has resumed thanks largely
    due to NVA attempts to clear the region, it remains to be seen however if this
    momentary lapse in fighting will last, as various sources estimate massive fighting
    to take place across the region come this friday. \n\nZeta, NVA Military Command
    had the following to say: \"The lies and deceit of TTI and their pirate allies
    will not break the New Venal Alliance, we will fight to keep the free space lanes
    open.\"_\n\nPromptly backed up by colleague Violation: _\"We will never leave
    our home, and will continue to fight for it.\"_\n\nTTI and M3G4 officials were
    unavailable for comment.\n\nTravellers, regardless of affiliation are advised
    to stay away from the area."
