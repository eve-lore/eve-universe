- body: "### Empress Breaks Silence on Upwell\n\nDomain, Amarr - Empress Catiz I has
    given a public address on Upwell workforce clone transfers. Over the last month
    both those for and against the transfers have called for the Empress to speak
    on the issue. The Empress broke her silence in a cluster-wide broadcast made from
    the Imperial Palace on Amarr Prime.\n\nIn an uncharacteristic move, the Empress
    focused on scripture, beginning with \u201C'As Emperor rules Holder; as Holder
    rules Serf; Yet all under Heaven serve Me,' Consider those words, \u2018all under
    Heaven serve Me\u2019. Not only those who serve within the Empire, but all. 'You
    will bring its message to every planet of every star in the heavens.' Not only
    the reaches of our holy Empire, but \u2018every planet.\u2019\u201D\n\nThe speech
    was however not entirely positive on the issue. \u201CSacred flesh may not be
    remade, but those who consider their bodies profane or filled with sin might feel
    the need to cast them off.\u201D The religious doctrine of sacred flesh is usually
    only applied to royals, not the commoners who are most likely to seek out Upwell
    workforce transfers. However, the implication that Upwell transfers are desirable
    to the sinful echoes the rhetoric used by Upwell\u2019s critics.\n\nThe Empress
    concluded that \u201CThose considering Upwell\u2019s invitation must maintain
    their faith. No matter what world they live in, or what flesh they inhabit, they
    must carry their devotion to Amarr with them.\u201D The address was met with rapturous
    applause at the Imperial Palace and was praised as a \u201Cthoughtful and powerful
    exploration of the topic through the lens of faith\u201D by Amarr Certified News.
    \n\nThe speech, however, fell short of passing an Imperial Edict on the matter.
    Without an edict, the decision on whether to allow the Upwell recruitment will
    remain with the noble houses and their holders. Those who can gain access to recruitment
    facilities will be free to transfer.\n\nLord Arim Ardishapur, the most vocal opponent
    of Upwell within the Amarr royal houses, told Amarr Certified News that he was
    \u201Chappy to await a clear edict on the matter once the Empress feels the time
    has come.\u201D adding that \u201Cone cannot argue with wisdom born of scripture.\u201D
    Sources within House Ardishapur have told the Scope that Lord Arim has withdrawn
    from any public debate on the issue following the Empress' uncharacteristic theological
    approach, leading to speculation that this was the reason for her reliance on
    scripture.\n\nKing Farokh Khanid, an open advocate of Upwell workforce transfers,
    called the announcement \u201Can acceptable lecture on theology.\u201D He too
    was left dissatisfied by the Empress' failure to deliver an edict on the matter,
    but offered that he was glad she was \u201Copen to the future, even if she is
    not yet ready to embrace it.\u201D \n\n### News In Brief\n- Labor Populists deny
    any remaining connection to former member and terrorist Thibaul Tailler.\n\n-
    Questions raised by CONCORD as a known associate of the Deathless Circle spotted
    in SOE station in the Efu system.\n\n- Sukuuvestaa executive board meets with
    Upwell Consortium representatives as the Chief Executive Panel considers workforce
    transfers.\n\n- Kam\xED D\xEDa\u2019s latest collection was banned in Amarr Empire
    by the Ministry of Internal Order."
