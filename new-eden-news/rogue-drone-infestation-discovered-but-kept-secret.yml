- body: "A report filtered out from reliable sources within the Inner Circle of CONCORD
    has revealed that a huge infestation of rogue drones was found well within empire
    space. There is a strong indication that the recently discovered swarm constitutes
    a new breed of the drones. The leaked report further states that this discovery
    was made some weeks ago, but has been carefully kept under wrap by CONCORD since.
    The reason given is that the exact nature of this new breed is as of yet not fully
    understood and the presence of curious bystanders can lead to infestation or contamination
    of these vessels, spreading the rogue drones even further.   \n  \nThe report
    also claims that the rogue drone hive was discovered in a so called deadspace
    pocket, which explains why it remained undetected for so long. Many feel that
    this claim discredits the whole report, as every spacefarer knows that deadspace
    is totally inaccessible. Since the deadspace phenomenon was first discovered centuries
    ago, many have tried to unlock the secrets to entering these elusive areas, but
    to no avail. That semi-sentient entity like the rogue drones have mastered deadspace
    sounds frankly ludicrous. Nevertheless, there is a grain of truth to be found
    in the report and it will be interesting to see how CONCORD officials respond
    to the leaked report."
