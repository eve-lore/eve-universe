- body: "Last week, the Republic Fleet denied a request by one of its captains to
    lead a task force in what has been described as the 'pacification of criminal
    elements' in the Molden Heath region after the loss of his patrol. \n\nKarishal
    Muritor \u2013 Captain 1st Class, who was presented with the prestigious Drupar\u2019s
    Sun award earlier last month for \u2018consistent and meritorious service to the
    Republic\u2019 \u2013 had allegedly deviated from his assigned patrol route and
    was attacked in the Oddelulf system by several capsuleer pilots who were believed
    to be under the employ of the Outbreak corporation. The attack resulted in the
    total destruction of the outnumbered Republic patrol. \n\nMuritor, who has earned
    a reputation throughout the Minmatar Republic as a daring and highly skilled commander
    is reported to have repeatedly petitioned his superiors to assign a task force
    to the region during the inquest into the loss of his patrol. A spokesperson for
    the Republic Fleet issued a statement in which he explained: \"Captain Muritor
    was found to be off his assigned patrol route when the Republic craft under his
    command were destroyed. Currently, he has been releaved of his duties until further
    inquiries are made.\" \n\nThe spokesperson went on to add that \"The captain\u2019s
    request to assign valuable Fleet resources to purge the relatively benign criminal
    element of Molden Heath has been denied. While we regret the loss of the men and
    women under Captain Muritor\u2019s command, we hope that this experience will
    increase his respect and obedience for the directives set out by the Republic
    Fleet.\" \n\nWhile Karishal Muritor has remained silent since his duties were
    temporarily ended, a source close to him is said to have commented that the captain
    was \"angered and dismayed by the decision of the Admiralty\" but had reluctantly
    accepted their judgment and will await his punishment. Critics of the Captain
    have since described this incident as an example of the type of cavalier attitude
    towards the rules that has been increasing, which \"might be instrumental in the
    success of an incautious rebel fleet has no place in the Republic.\""
