- body: "**5ZXX-K -** On Thursday 12th at approximately 11:00, the first of two planned
    Flagships was launched in the Mordu's HQ System. The vessel, christened _\u201DHonour\u201D_
    , will be under the direct command of Colonel Akuras of the Mordu's Legion Command.
    \n\nThe exact specifications of the ship remain unknown, although anonymous high-level
    sources have supported more widespread rumours that the vessel is a capital-class
    craft of some kind. The Legion itself has refrained from officially commenting
    on the ship type at this moment, offering only the word \u201Cflagship\u201D as
    a description. Given the longstanding history of other Legion task forces utilising
    Dreadnought-class capitals, the current speculation is rife. \n\nFollowing the
    launch there was a small, private ceremony held in station, where the Caldari
    Navy officially transferred control of the vessel over to Colonel Akuras of the
    Mordu's High Command. Col. Akuras graciously accepted the transferral, promising
    that _Honour_ would live up to it\u2019s name, and uphold the shared ideals of
    the Legion and the Caldari State. \n\nWhen asked in a brief interview about the
    tasks _Honour_ will be expected to undertake, the commander replied: \u201CShe
    is just the first step in a planned build up of forces to reinforce our position
    in the Pure Blind Region. It takes more than one ship to secure a region this
    large, however it will certainly be a considerably easier task now.\u201D \n\nCommenting
    on the plans for a possible second flagship vessel, the commander was less forthcoming,
    hinting that so far, only a name existed: \u201CAs with most plans of this nature,
    there is a large investment of time and other resources involved. Hopefully one
    day _Glory_ will fly next to her sister, allowing the Mordu's Legion a greater
    range of tactical options that it can choose to employ in the future.\u201D \n\nColonel
    Akuras himself has a long and distinguished history with the Legion, and was the
    expected candidate for command of the vessel and it\u2019s support. The son of
    an officer who fought alongside Mordu during the Caldari-Gallente war, he has
    followed on in his father\u2019s footsteps, earning the Legion\u2019s Gold Cluster
    with bar, the Legion\u2019s Purple heart, and various other accolades. His loyalty
    to the Legion is almost as renown as his success in establishing the Legion since
    their relocation, a mission he was personally tasked with overseeing. \n\nThe
    Legion has slowly been consolidating their position in Pure Blind, ever since
    their rearrangement of forces primarily to the area over a year ago, a move that
    followed the [high-profile end](\u201Chttp://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=899&tid=4\u201D)
    to their contract with Outer Ring Excavations. Since that time, they have launched
    squads of increasing capability and strength, such as the [ \u201CNight Stalkers\u201D](\u201D),
    the 5th Dreadnought task force despatched since the repositioning. \n\nAccording
    to sources within the Legion High command, _Honour_ will be undergoing test runs
    at the Legions Testing Facilities in the Pure Blind Region, and is scheduled for
    tactical deployment within the next few weeks."
