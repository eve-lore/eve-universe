    Following the recent incidents at Sukuuvestaa holdings throughout the Caldari
    State and its held regions, the Caldari Business Tribunal are initiating its own
    review of the events and Sukuuvestaa's security protocols. The announcement has
    been met with criticism from Sukuuvestaa and several other megacorporations.\n\nThe
    past month has seen multiple attacks against Sukuuvestaa Corporation and its subsidiary
    security force, the Peace and Order Unit, including the bombing of a Sukuuvestaa
    station in the Arvasaras system. The megacorporation has launched an internal
    investigation rumored to operate on a budget of tens of millions of ISK, and vastly
    increased the spending for its Security division and the Peace and Order Unit.\n\nCriticism
    has been directed at the CBT following the announcement.\n\n\"The CBT has the
    right to enquire into the matters of the State's corporations, but this is not
    a matter it needs to concern itself with,\" says Oilenen Inuki, head of public
    relations at Sukuuvestaa.\n\n\"Hyasyoda stands on a foundation of the traditions
    of self-governance and independence,\" said a spokesperson for the Hyasyoda Corporation.
    \"We value the government of the State, but this is not a matter for the CBT.\"\n\nA
    response from Wiyrkomi stated, \"We do not believe that security matters such
    as those endured by Sukuuvestaa should concern the CBT or other state entities.
    Should the matter become a threat to the stability of the Caldari State, we are
    confident that SuVee would welcome assistance.\"\n\n\"The CBT will not impose
    itself upon Sukuuvestaa,\" explained Auvulatoh Vaira, Principal Clerk of the Caldari
    Business Tribunal. \"We will not interfere with any internal efforts of Sukuuvestaa.
    \ We are simply looking to answer a series of questions that we feel need to be
    addressed.\""
