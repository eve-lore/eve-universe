- body: "The Bleak Lands - With world events crashing forward the war in The Bleak
    Lands continues unabated. Events there are being thrust once more into the limelight
    as reports filtered in of Minmatar militias pouring into the combat zone reinforcing
    the strength of the Defiants and bringing a string of victories to the rogue Minmatar
    force. \n\nThe Saracens were quick to downplay such victories but brought forward
    questions about the origin of these militias. \n\n\"While we have been fighting
    a hard struggle against determined and elusive heathens my Fleet stands steadfast
    and it will not be long before we have these vagabonds in our grasp.\" Admiral
    Saracen stated \"However in our recent battles our fleet has uncovered evidence
    that these so called \u2018militias\u2019 are based in the Minmatar Republic.
    The question has to be asked of the Republic: why are they supporting these elements,
    and if they are not why do they continue to sit on their hands doing nothing about
    it? It only lends weight to my suspicion that the so called Republic is supporting
    the Defiants\u2019 efforts \u2013 either that or they are entirely incompetent.\"
    \n\nA spokesperson for the Prime Minister was quick to issue a response stating
    that it was unaware of any such activities and would commence an investigation
    immediately, going to some lengths to emphasize once again that the government
    deplored the actions of the Defiants in the Bleak Lands. This position is not
    publically shared by the entire parliament, with some tribes continuing to contest
    the official line."
