- body: "Caldari Judges earlier today awarded Pete Sance, Jay Pops and the rest of
    their team a warrant for the hunting down and execution of Albert Stance and Victor
    Stats, the scientists who are believed to have invented a brain wave control device.
    \  \n  \nThe team, led by Pete Sance spared no time and raced to the Yulai laboratories
    where the scientists were rumoured to be but they had escaped by the time the
    team arrived. Evidence from the abandoned laboratory indicates that they had made
    significant progress in constructing the device, but were still a short way from
    completion.   \n  \nIt is believed the scientists escaped on an Interbus transport
    after receiving a tip off about the movements of their persuers. This explains
    why they were able to slip past those hunting them in the very short time they
    had available.   \n  \nThere is currently no information as to their new whereabouts."
