- body: "Heimatar - Simple hauling contract negotiations have ended up tangled in
    controversy this week after Mechanical Industries secured a large majority of
    contracts over other . \n\nWith trading routes from the core Matari worlds to
    the frontiers of the Great Wildlands becoming more lucrative in the past year,
    massive trade contracts offered by a conglomerate of industrial corporations here
    have been the hot topic among investors for weeks. \n\nThe two expected front
    runners contending for these opportunities have been New Order Transportation,
    an old respected company who has had several successful past contracts with the
    conglomerate, and Mechanical Industries, an up and coming mercantile company founded
    on the fringes of the Wildlands itself. The two Matari corporations have been
    in direct competition for years in many markets stretching between their respective
    bases of operation. \n\nEarly forecasts by independent market analysts heavily
    favoured New Order in winning a majority of the contracts based on the corporation's
    long-standing relations with the client companies and excellent reputation for
    making tough runs on time and intact, leading to a sizable 8% gain in the company's
    stock over the past month. Yet, when the dealing was done and announced to the
    public, Mechanical Industries had somehow scored quite the corporate upset, securing
    25 of the 27 contracts in question. \n\nAfter reeling from the news and the subsequent
    drop of almost a quarter of the company's stock value, New Order Transportation
    is not taking the decision lying down. After an emergency shareholders meeting,
    New Order has decided to challenge the agreement, citing preliminary internal
    investigations that revealed 'suspicious' activity. \n\n\"We have always strived
    to succeed in our markets through asset security, punctuality, and hard work.\"
    said New Order CEO Haca Eskavert, \"This doesn't mean we're not wary of the sort
    of tactics used by companies who do not share our values. We will not rest until
    we have exposed the truth behind this decision; and we have the resources, and
    the will, to uncover that truth.\" \n\nMechanical Industries CEO Sveard Otolf
    seemed unconcerned. \"It should not surprise anyone that intelligent businesses
    value innovation and new ideas in those they chose to partner with. Our competitors
    have forgotten this, and when it came time to put hard ISK down, we simply provided
    a better, leaner solution for their needs, and it showed at the negotiation table.\"
    \n\nNew Order's investigations had best find what they seek, and soon. Industry
    insiders are whispering that Ms. Eskavert's position as CEO may be on the line
    soon should such inquiries prove fruitless."
