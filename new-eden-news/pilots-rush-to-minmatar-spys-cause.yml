- body: "SIRSESHIN - Pod pilots rallied to the aid of exposed secret agent Rirokton
    Teursen in Sirseshin several weeks ago but were unable to affect his escape from
    forces bent on his destruction. \n\nEurik Karsteinn, Teursen's loyal friend of
    many years made a plea in Sirseshin for pilots with good standing towards the
    Minmatar Republic to form up and aid the agent in his escape. A band of twenty
    or so answered the call and with news of a Caldari Navy patrol in the vicinity,
    this added urgency to proceedings and with the promise of a handsome reward once
    they reached Minmatar space the motley convoy set off. \n\nHowever, it would appear
    that Teursen had been double-crossed and Helpdesk, a vehemently pro-Caldari pilot
    was in on the rescue committee, having been unceremoniously removed she swore
    revenge and vowed to kill the fleeing Minmatar. \n\nPerhaps it was the hour long
    wait for the armada to form up but this gave plenty of time for Helpdesk to devise
    a plan and she carried it out with ruthless efficiency. Barging into the fleet
    sent to protect Teursen she succeeded in flushing him out and although he managed
    to flee the initial scene, the driven killer followed her prey to the next system
    and succeeded in pod killing the escaping spy. \n\nWithin moments the Caldari
    Navy patrol despatched to secure Teursen turned up, to be met by an angry cadre
    of Minmatar-loyal pilots bent on revenge. Furious that Concord had allowed Helpdesk
    to escape, the mob turned on the patrol but they were beaten off, further denting
    their pride. After the loss of some smaller vessels, Karsteinn ordered his volunteers
    to stand down to avoid any further bloodshed. \n\nAfter thanking the pilots for
    their help, Karsteinn slipped away leaving the pod pilots to reflect upon their
    losses and the whereabouts of their new ally. \n\nReports leaking from Caldari
    security sources indicate that Karsteinn somehow found the whereabouts of his
    friend. Despite a heavy Caldari presence at the medical facility where Teursen
    was due to recover, somehow the two managed to escape, disappearing to destination
    unknown in an unregistered Cheetah covert-operations vessel. \n\nThe news is a
    huge embarrassment to Caldari security forces who are on the hunt for a mole within
    the operation to secure the Minmatar agent."
