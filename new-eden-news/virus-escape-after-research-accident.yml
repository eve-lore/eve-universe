- body: "Chaos erupted on the planet of Sharhelund III, the only inhabited planet
    in the Sharhelund system, when a research vessel fell out of orbit and burned
    up in the atmosphere. The ship, the Restless Spirit, is believed to have struck
    another ship in a low orbit accident, leaving all of its gyroscopic and engine
    systems wrecked. Without those systems it appears to have fallen out of orbit
    and fragmented on re-entry. \n\nMore disturbing, however, is that the Restless
    Spirit was conducting research on several highly contagious and lethal viruses.
    One of these viruses is believed to have escaped into the atmosphere of Sharhelund
    III after its cryogenic capsule splintered from the crashing vessel and was broken
    open on impact. Winds surrounding the crash site carried the virus to one of the
    nearby cities where many hundreds of cases have already been reported, with the
    fatality list growing slowly but steadily. \n\nMedical officials have along with
    government representatives announced a state of martial law in the affected regions,
    with a zero-tolerance curfew being held up with the threat of lethal force. \u201CWe
    expect the casualties to rise before we can fully contain this. However, we have
    our top groups working on decontaminating as large an area as possible. If anyone
    experiences symptoms correlating with this virus they are advised to isolate themselves
    and alert the medical teams who will pick them up for treatment as swiftly as
    possible.\u201D \n\nGiven the extreme situation and the curfew being maintained,
    head investigator Obbet Rember II is appealing to the public to help with the
    investigation surrounding the failure of the Restless Spirit. \u201CThis ship
    should not have crashed. It was top of the line in every respect. I call on all
    capsuleers to help us resolve the issue. We currently cannot spare any ships,
    as they are all shuttling supplies to the stricken areas. Anyone with any information
    is asked to contact me directly.\u201D"
