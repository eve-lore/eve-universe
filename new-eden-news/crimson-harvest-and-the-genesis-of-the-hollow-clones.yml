    Dr Hwung and the Advent of the Hollow Clone\nOn the planet of Tei-Su in the Lirsautton
    system, there is a necropolis. In that ancient city of the dead stands the mausoleum
    of a once-great family. Amidst the hundreds of rows of generations laid to rest,
    one coffin lies empty. Empty, that is, save two small trophies. The name on that
    coffin is Dr. Hwung Rudolfo, once the pride of a planet, now its greatest shame.
    \n\nThe more prestigious of these entombed trophies was awarded in YC127, the
    Jin-Mei Science Award for Achievement in Cybernetics. The triumph of this award
    was, unfortunately, quickly overshadowed by his greater legacy. For the Blood
    Raiders, he will be remembered for flinging open the gates to glory. For the Order
    of St. Tetrimon, he was the father of abominations. For the Upwell Constorium,
    he is a mistake best forgotten. The reason for all these responses is the same,
    the Hollow Clone. \n\nHwung Rudolfo grew up a member of the Jin-Mei\u2019s ruling
    Sang Do caste, though generations of poor financial management had left his family
    rich only in heritage. His mother, an immigrant from the nearby system of Ardene,
    refused to allow her son to wallow in his family\u2019s fallen status. Rudolfo
    recalled in an interview by the Interplanetary Media Network, \u201Cwhatever I
    took an interest in, my mother would push me to be the best. It is thanks to her
    that I learned that greatness often comes at the cost of comfort.\u201D\n\n\u201CShe
    pushed me to perform ballet as a child\u201D, Rudolfo reflected with a broad smile,
    \u201CI was not a natural. My mother told me that I was a smart boy, but that
    my overthinking was an obstacle I had to surmount. So I practiced until I did
    not need my brain to know where my feet should be, and soon I could jete as easily
    as I could walk. This is the grace of action unencumbered by thought.\u201D\n\nThis
    was the key revelation that would earn Hwung that buried trophy. Hired by Eifyr
    and Co. after completing his doctorate, Hwung was assigned to improve workforce
    efficiency for the Upwell Consortium\u2019s Equinox suite. The Mecha-Tooling upgrade
    he developed allowed workforce clones to elegantly control construction mechs
    with a \u201CReflexive Interface\u201D. Unlike the neural interfaces used by capsuleers,
    Hwung\u2019s invention connected the nervous system directly to external technology,
    bypassing the brain entirely. \n\nThe innovation was hailed as a triumph, and
    Hwung became a celebrity in the cybernetic field. His new interface meant untrained
    workers could control machines as if they were a part of their own bodies. But
    for Hwung, success was not enough; his goal was greatness. When he was handed
    the Jin-Mei Science Award, he leaned into the microphone and whispered, \u201CJust
    wait until you see what\u2019s next.\u201D\n\nThe true potential of the Reflexive
    Interface, Hwung theorized, was still to come. To achieve that, he proposed a
    new device, the Cybernetic Neural Lattice (CNL), a bridge between reflexive inputs
    and a lattice of neural networks working in harmony. With this increased power,
    he aimed to enable the average workforce clone to not just execute simple tasks,
    but also instantly master complex skills.\n\nThe Upwell Consortium sank trillions
    into its development, constructing hundreds of research facilities. With all that
    investment, Hwung was under constant scrutiny. To satisfy his backers, he arranged
    a simple test. At every experimental site, cloneblanks that did not yet support
    infomorphs would receive the new implants. These cloneblanks would then be hooked
    up to a simple set of security protocols to see if the system could register basic
    reflex responses from the bodies.\n\nWhen the first bodies lurched off their operating
    tables, the researchers were shocked, too shocked to run. The bodies should have
    moved the system, not the other way round. If they had foreseen that the system
    could also instruct the body, perhaps things would have gone differently. Instead,
    hundreds died across the cluster before the first alarm was even sounded. The
    bodies, propelled by corrupted security systems, tore through every facility with
    blood-curdling efficiency. Then, they took to the ships.\n\nExactly what went
    wrong is still unknown,but some how monsters without minds took to space with
    a singluar goal; kill everything they see. Without infomorphs, they were dubbed
    Hollow Clones. \n\nIf the story had ended there, Upwell would have quarantined
    the sites and this horrible tale may have gone untold. Instead, it occurred just
    as the Blood Raiders prepared for their clone hunt. The Raiders perverted this
    tragedy into a challenge. Many young sect members have descended on the newly
    destroyed Biocybernetics Facilities, looking to prove themselves against the hordes
    of Hollow Clones. Some have even survived.\n\nThe Order of St Tetrimon has also
    rushed to combat the hollow clones. For this storied sect, a body acting without
    a soul is an abomination that must be destroyed. Though they have remained unwaivering
    in their usual animosity against the Blood Raiders, the two groups now find themselves
    fighting the same enemy. There is no threat of cooperation, however, as for the
    Blood Raiders, every Hollow destroyed by the Tetrimon is a source of clone blood
    they have been denied, and for the Tetrimon, every site the Blood Raiders claim
    only adds to the heresy.\n\nWhat started as a dream for Grace has mutated into
    a cautionary tale of blood-soaked brutality. Hwung Rudolfo was on site when the
    disastrous malfunction occurred, and while his exact fate remains uncertain, there
    were no known survivors. The violence surrounding these experimental sites has
    prevented any attempts at recovering bodies. All his grieving mother could do
    was bury the award that once made her son the pride of Lirsautton, side by side
    with the child\u2019s ballet trophy and the dream it unlocked.\n\n## News in Brief\n-
