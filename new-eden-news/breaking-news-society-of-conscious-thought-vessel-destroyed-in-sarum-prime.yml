    been able to confirm that a Gnosis class battlecruiser registered to the Society
    of Conscious Thought has been destroyed in The Throne Worlds.\n\nThe vessel, piloted
    by Elder Mentor Matshi Raish of the Geminate Chapter of the Society of Conscious
    Thought, was destroyed on order of Empress Jamyl Sarum I after repeated quests
    for the vessel to withdraw from Imperial space. \n\nThe incident happened at the
    Mekhios Graveyard in Sarum Prime, where a combined fleet of Thukker Tribe and
    Republic Fleet vessels were destroyed by an Imperial taskforce during the Battle
    of Mekhios on June 10th, YC110, leaving a massive debris field that has become
    a monument to the victory. \n\nEmpress Sarum delivered a rousing speech to Amarr
    loyalists before the appearence of the Society vessel, which began using an unidentified
    scanning system on her Avatar class titan  _Seraph._ After a number of requests
    to cease operations and leave Imperial space that were seemingly disregarded,
    the order was given for Amarr Loyalists and her own escort to destroy the vessel.\n\nAt
    this stage there has been no formal statement made by the Society of Conscious
    Thought in response to the loss of the vessel, and the loss of Mentor Raish 's
    capsule."
