    - The trial of Pierre Allendreau, the man accused of manufacturing and distributing
    the suicide pill 'Liberty,' saw an unusual turn of events today, when those the
    prosecution are painting as the case's victims rose to the defense of the accused.
    \n\n\"He wasn't out to make a buck. He sold basically at cost, and would make
    as many as requested. We would have paid a lot more,\" said Hebark Tooten, director
    of a mining colony in Postouvin. Another director from the same system, Freid
    Lefebre, said, \"He was the only one protecting us from being victims. If Sansha
    comes for us - any of us - CONCORD can't protect us, the Empires combined can't
    protect us\u2026 who are we supposed to rely on? The capsuleers? They're just
    as likely to kill us even if they do manage to stop a Sansha raid. What other
    options do we have?\" \n\nThe prosecution asked for a short recess, which the
    judge denied. The string of witnesses speaking out in the accused's defense continued.
    Said Gael Sorchine, director of still another colony that had contacted Allendreau
    to purchase the suicide pill: \"The Nation promises the death of liberty, the
    capsuleers promise death. If we are the victims in this case, it is not Mr. Allendreau
    that made us so.\""
