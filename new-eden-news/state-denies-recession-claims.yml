- body: "Representatives of the Caldari State\u2019s Chief Executive Panel issued
    a public statement this morning, refuting several claims recently put forth by
    noted economist Arvelan Tokaru.   \n  \nIn an in-depth article published in respected
    economic journal _The Wiramar Index_ last Monday, Dr. Tokaru warns that numerous
    signs indicate the Caldari State may be headed for a major recession.   \n  \nForemost
    among these, she claims, are rising unemployment numbers and crippled supply chains
    stemming from rift trade agreements with the Amarr Empire, previously the State\u2019s
    top trading partner. Dr. Tokaru also states that in an attempt to salvage the
    situation, the Chief Executive Panel has engaged in what she terms \u201Cback-against-the-wall
    protectionism,\u201D heavy-handedly levying tariffs that are beginning to cause
    diplomatic ill-will among smaller trading partners and \u201Care sure to backfire
    in the long run.\u201D   \n  \nThe Executive Panel in its statement wholly refutes
    these claims, stating that unemployment numbers are at much the same level they
    have been at over the last two years, and that the tariffs have been imposed to
    promote protection of jobs within the State and maintain the domestic standard
    of living. According to them, the rift trade agreements with Amarr are \u201Can
    unfortunate consequence of administrative difficulties within Empire agencies,
    which we have been assured will be rectified soon.\u201D   \n  \nA number of analysts
    from within the State have spoken out in support of Tokaru\u2019s claims, reporting
    that the State\u2019s methods for calculating unemployment figures are misleading
    and that the actual numbers are higher than they have been for over eighty years.
    \  \n  \n\u201CThey only include workers who sign on,\u201D stated an analyst
    who wished to remain anonymous. \u201CIf you haven\u2019t reported yourself to
    the Bureau of Civilian Affairs \u2013 a trek through a bureaucratic labyrinth
    which takes the better part of a day, and can go wrong in numerous ways, all of
    which will result in your application being rejected without notification \u2013
    you\u2019re not included among the unemployed. This excludes large portions of
    the population who, even notwithstanding the inefficiency of the bureaucracy,
    have long since given up any chance of finding steady work.\u201D   \n  \n\u201CThere
    is a very definite underclass here,\u201D he said, \u201Cand it is growing.\u201D"
