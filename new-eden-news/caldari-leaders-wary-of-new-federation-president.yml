- body: 'New Caldari - State Executor Tibus Heth took time today to speak to the press
    on the recent Gallente elections. He said that "any attempt to intrude upon the
    sovereign territory of the Caldari State will be met with an immediate and overwhelming
    response" by Caldari forces. His statement was seen as a warning to the new Federation
    administration against attempts to retake Caldari Prime and the Gallente border
    systems occupied by the State, something which Jacus Roden mentioned several times
    during his campaign.  Caldari Navy forces in the occupied territories have been
    at an elevated state of alert since Tuesday''s elections.


    Elsewhere in the State, public reaction has been muted.  Most corporations have
    followed the lead of Ishukone, which released a statement saying that the company
    hoped that the new Federation administration would "recognize the need to stabilize
    the cluster-wide economic and political situation," avoiding any comment on specific
    Federation policy.


    Such caution is not unexpected, according to political analyst Ylle Audre, due
    to the business interests that many of the megacorporations and their subsidiaries
    still maintain in the Federation despite the ongoing border hostilities.


    "Roden is probably the closest you can come to a Caldari CEO outside of the State
    itself, and despite his Caldari Prime comments during the campaign, I think many
    Caldari CEOs see him as someone they may be able to deal with," says Audre.  "Whether
    or not they can -- or if Heth and the Provists will allow them to do so -- remains
    to be seen, of course."'
