    Damaged Republic Parliament Bureau in orbit of Turnur I*\n\n### Stellar Disruption
    and Wormhole Activity in Turnur Aftermath\n\nTurnur, Metropolis \u2013 Turnur's
    star continues to exhibit a highly energetic and disrupted state following yesterday's
    extreme stellar event, with the star undergoing a rapid and unpredictable evolution
    to an apparent new phase.\n\nThe planet of Turnur I continues to feel the after-effects
    of the impinging radiation burst and wave of supercharged plasma particles, with
    its atmosphere reduced to an ionized remnant of even its formerly thin but breathable
    troposphere layer. Seismic disturbances have been monitored and emerging hotspots
    have been detected across the planet, leading scientists monitoring the situation
    to believe the planet's core has been highly disrupted by the spike in electromagnetic
    energy impacting the world. Suborbital probes are searching for survivors but
    there is little hope that any will be found.\n\nThe Republic Parliament Bureau
    station in orbit of Turnur I has also experienced further damage and collapse
    as stressed outer structures and peripheral habitation modules have detached from
    the relatively intact core of the station. Services remain highly minimal and
    much of the returning crew are engaged in search and rescue operations, together
    with emergency response units from CONCORD and the Sisters of EVE.\n\nIn a particularly
    disturbing development, reports of Triglavian activity have been confirmed. Large
    squadrons of Svarog Clade vessels have been recorded roaming through Turnur in
    an apparent \"reconnaissance in force\" by the Triglavians. AEGIS units taking
    part in continuing search, rescue, and evacuation efforts across Turnur have monitored
    the activity and reported their findings to EDENCOM high command.\n\n![triglavian

    from Turnur also indicate significant effects on local space-time topography as
    well as large increases in disruptive radiation throughout the system. Ship sensor
    systems appear to be severely impacted while changes to space-time have increased
    the performance of warp drives. In a development predicted by some scientists
    and capsuleers, the system is reportedly seeing a large increase in unstable wormhole
    activity, with some noting the similar effects, at differing scales, seen after
    the Seyllin Incident and the Thera stellar event.\n\nCaptain Marshal Sirdan xer
    Qosh, Imperial Margrave and military governor of Amarr forces throughout the warzone,
    has declared a state of emergency and exhorted all 24th Imperial Crusade forces
    to \"seize Egmar and Vard, that we can use the knowledge we gained at such cost
    to prevent further disruptions, loss of life, and destruction of Imperial property.\"
    Republic Ambassador Keitan Yun is reported to have \"gesticulated vigorously and
    emphatically\" in the negative upon it being put to him by an ACN news correspondent
    that \"it may be in the best interests of the people of Egmar and Vard if the
    Republic retreats and allows experts from the Amarr Empire to take over the transmuters.\"\n\n![turnur
