    Four highly placed members of [Caldari Funds Unlimited](http://www.evelopedia.com/en/wiki/Caldari_Funds_Unlimited)'s
    executive staff resigned today, as reports continue to trickle out of the Caldari
    Business Tribunal regarding its ongoing investigation of the State's largest independent
    bank. The Tribunal has now confirmed that it has opened an investigation into
    the corporation's finances, and details are emerging as to the exact nature of
    the irregularities being looked into.\n\nThe four CFU executives, Sirotova Fukikaga,
    Tsurkuma Siainki, Orpakku Konken and Tatkashin Pukuwakai, were all junior vice-presidents
    in the corporation's investment banking and retirement account divisions. No reason
    has yet been given by either the executives or Caldari Funds Unlimited for the
    resignations, but there are reports that at least two of the four have been taken
    into custody by the Home Guard.\n\nMeanwhile, sources within the Tribunal have
    told the Scope that investigators believe Caldari Funds Unlimited may have misreported
    thousands of financial transactions to the House of Records, a violation of Caldari
    banking regulations. As a result, CBT officials believe CFU may have far less
    ISK reserves than it was reporting to the House of Records and Tribunal, possibly
    even below the minimum demanded to secure its deposits and maintain its other
    operations. If this is true, it would constitute a major violation of Caldari
    law.\n\nIn addition, Caldari Funds Unlimited CEO Jaan Omura is apparently under
    personal investigation, due to alleged contact with individuals linked to the
    Gallente Federal Intelligence Office. Though the Tribunal has officially denied
    that this is the case, the Scope has it from reliable sources that both the Caldari
    Navy and Corporate Police Force have been contacted for assistance with the investigation.
    Neither CFU nor Omura herself have been available for comment."
