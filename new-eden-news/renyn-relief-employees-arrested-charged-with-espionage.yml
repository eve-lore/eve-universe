    arrested members of Remyn Relief today, following the searches conducted at the
    charity''s offices last week. The arrested employees were charged with espionage
    for the Caldari State. Fifteen employees of the charity fund were arrested in
    relation to these charges.


    "This is a very harsh blow to us," said Kolin Lagarde, spokesperson for Renyn
    Relief.  "We will provide full cooperation and support to the authorities investigating
    this matter."


    A source within the SDII, wishing to remain anonymous, asserted that the charges
    are related to the fund''s recent initiatives on the outskirts of the Federation.
    "It is already clear that the arrested persons were using their status as a cover
    to spy on Gallente military forces in the Placid and Black Rise regions, severely
    compromising the operations of our Navy in the area and putting thousands of lives
    in danger. We intend to remove any conspirators completely."


    Gaido Noreitta, the founder and honorary chairman of Renyn Relief, was unavailable
    for comment. The charity fund''s representatives claim that Mr. Noreitta remains
    in  Federation space and is assisting the SDII with their enquiries.'
