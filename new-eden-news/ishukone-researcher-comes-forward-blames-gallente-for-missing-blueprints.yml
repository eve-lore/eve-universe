- body: "_\"Our people have a right to know the truth.\"_ said Olkkenen Osa, a junior
    researcher for the **Ishukone Corporation** who was responsible for leaking out
    the story of the missing blueprints earlier. \n\nOsa, who was furious of the fact
    that the **Crielere Command** seemed about to sweep the whole thing under the
    carpet, has no doubts about who is responsible for the theft. \n\n_\"Some Gallente
    did it. Of course they did! Unlike us, they don't monitor their scientists nearly
    enough. Every member of our research team is monitored around the clock by our
    leaders. And *they* sure as hell aren't going to steal their own blueprints. The
    Gallente have no honor!\"_\n\nWhen asked whether he wasn't worried that he was
    ruining the investigation by making these claims, Osa responded: _\"What investigation?
    Everything has pretty much been business as usual at the labs. Makes me laugh...our
    CEO is bending backwards to accomodate these bastards, and this is how they repay
    him!?\"_\n\nImmediately following his statement, the Crielere Command issued their
    own, stating that Olkkenen Osa has been temporarily removed from the research
    team."
