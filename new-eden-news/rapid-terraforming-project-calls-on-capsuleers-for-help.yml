- body: "Walkai Terraforming Industries, whose slogan **\"Building Better Worlds\"**
    is prominent in hundreds of their offices across EVE, announced today that they
    are in the final stages of planning to terraform the planet Iivinen IV, a planet
    in the Gallente / Caldari border zone. The statement made by the CEO of Walkai
    Terraforming Industries, Kentanen Koimota, was particularly interesting because
    of its presence in the border zones. Most previous projects have been in much
    more secure space.   \n  \nMr Koimota carried on to announce that due to radical
    terraforming technology breakthroughs, the process of transforming the planet
    from an inhospitable wasteland into a spatial body teeming with the building blocks
    of life can be done in mere months, as opposed to the years previous terraforming
    projects have taken.   \n  \nKentanen Koimota went on to finally announce that
    they would be seeking capsuleer assistance during several stages of this new process,
    an unprecedented move in this formerly highly secretive business. What the pilots
    will be required to do however, is the subject of much speculation."
