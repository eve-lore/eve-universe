    has detected \"an increase in spatio-temporal disturbances with a signature matching
    those emanating from unstable wormholes associated with Drifter Hive Systems,\"
    according to an advisory issued by the CONCORD Directive Intelligence Agency (CDIA).\n\nThe
    CDIA advisory notes that this \"could indicate a spike in wormholes forming as
    connections to Drifter Hive systems\" and adds that \"multiple spatio-temporal
    signals resonating with these increased disturbances could be caused by additional
    wormholes forming between Drifter Hive systems and other systems in the Anoikis
    network.\"\n\nThe CDIA notice raises its advice on exercising caution when travelling
    near ruined Jove Observatories and unidentified wormholes to \"avoid if possible,
    exercise extreme caution on encountering, and leave the vicinity immediately.\"
    The CDIA have also reiterated longstanding CONCORD advice that \"exploration of
    Drifter Hive Systems should be avoided at all costs.\"\n\n**CDIA Capsuleer Support
    Project**\n\nIn a related development, the CDIA has confirmed that is preparing
    a series of technical readout datafiles for the use of newly-qualified capsuleers
    and expects to make a more detailed announcement shortly. The project is believed
    to be part of CONCORD 's continuing effort to build up capsuleer force capabilities
    during the Triglavian invasion crisis and is reportedly benefitting from resources
    provided by the New Eden Defense Fund.\n\n**In Other News**\n\n  * Security Situation
