    Senate Defense Committee head, Vance Opheron, has issued a preliminary report
    to the Senate's Military Oversight department. This follows an official petition
    last week by Senator Chermoul, calling for a full review of the Federal Defense
    Union's administration.\n\nInitial press releases regarding the report, though
    relatively low on detail at this time, indicate the first findings into the FDU's
    administration 'leave little to be concerned about.' Early probes into previous
    budget allocation, communications management and internal security are said to
    be of a satisfactory level and a non-contributing factor in the steady loss of
    occupancy of dozens of Gallente systems along the Caldari border. However, the
    media release from the Senate's Military Oversight department stresses these are
    the results of low intensity investigations, and do not represent definitive conclusions.\n\nSenator
    Chermoul, having received a copy of the preliminary report, stated the following
    in response:\n\n\"So far what I have read does not seem consistent with the reality
    of the situation. Don't get me wrong, I do hope there are no serious issues in
    the FDU and this report is a sign of good things to come. But the fact remains.
    Our space has been overrun by Caldari militia and this needs attending to by the
    right people in the right places.\"\n\nWhen asked if he was satisfied with the
    investigation so far, the senator stated only that he hoped the committee would
    'give the matter the full weight of attention it required.'"
