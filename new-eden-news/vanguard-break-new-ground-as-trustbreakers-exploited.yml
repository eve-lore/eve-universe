    Trustbreakers Open Planetary Defenses to Vanguard Subversion\n\nMultiple Planetary
    Defense Networks have suffered outages in insurgent star systems. Reports of these
    PDN disruptions came in following the deployment of \u201CTrustbreaker Arrays\u201D
    by the Deathless Wraiths. With defenses down, clashing Vanguard warclone deployments
    have been sighted across Raihbaka II. \n\nThe Trustbreaker Arrays are capable
    of scanning PDNs and using a remote connection to the Warden in Zarzakh to reconstruct
    the passkeys necessary to shut down surface-to-orbit turrets on temperate planets.
    However, these arrays have come under persistent attack by Drifter-controlled
    forces. The Deathless Wraiths called for support in this conflict, but most capsuleers
    preferred to take the opportunity to keep the arrays alive long enough to generate
    PDN passkeys before allowing them to be destroyed. Almost all these PDN passkeys
    found their way into the hands of militia forces who used them to disrupt defenses
    in pirate-controlled areas, exposing them to ground-based assaults. \n\nAccording
    to reports from the field, Vanguard warclones have been spotted fighting each
    other for control of the compromised planetary defense turrets at sites across
    Raihbaka II, retargeting them at each other's deployment infrastructure. The opposing
    warclones seem to be fighting on behalf of the Guristas\u2019 Commando Guri on
    one side, and Mordu\u2019s Legion mercenaries on the other.\n\nThe split loyalties
    of the Vanguard imply their usage has been made available by the Deathless Circle
    to both the Legion and the Guri. This has sparked rumors that the Circle\u2019s
    primary interest is in the dependency on Vanguard deployments in a conflict, rather
    than the outcome of the conflict. It is clear that those responsible for the ongoing
    development of the Vanguard deep within The Fulcrum\u2014led by the Arkombine\u2019s
    Lifegiver and the enigmatic Quartermaster\u2014are taking full advantage of these
    deployments as a proving ground for the minds, clones, and equipment wielded by
    this new generation.\n\nDespite this, the Deathless Circle is believed to be reeling
    from the destruction of their Trustbreakers. Theft of their passkeys also means
    they have lost the ability to dictate deployment details. The State Protectorate
    coordinated the disabling of PDNs in Raihbaka for counter-pirate deployments by
    Mordu\u2019s Legion, with Tribal Liberation Force similarly well placed to counter
    Angel forces in the future. General Gar Orga of the TLF sent a message from the
    frontlines stating that \u201CWith the assistance of capsuleers fighting Cartel
    insurgency in space and delivering these passkeys, plus the potential of Legion
    coordinated Vanguard efforts on the ground, we will soon free these worlds of
    the pirate corruption.\u201C Mumara Kara of the State Protectorate added that
    \u201CVanguard forces have pushed back Guristas and proven that they need not
    only be a force for chaos in this cluster.\u201D\n\n![VG Militia](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/6N6gCTDKrvra5kPhdDPy7J/013e129581c640cc67882ec43423de1b/image.png)\n<div

    Agency Network Deploys Vanguard as Colony Attacks Escalate\n\nEarly Thursday morning,
    local administrations of four Equinox workforce colonies in the Branch, Querious,
    Vale of the Silent, and Wicked Creek regions reported attacks on transport and
    supply vessels at remote worksites. This marks the latest escalation in a wave
    of increasingly violent raids faced by Equinox nullsec colonies in recent weeks.
    Those responsible for these attacks, who identify themselves only as \u201Cmilitia\",
    are suspected of belonging to a decentralized movement that aggressively opposes
    Equinox workforce colonies.\n\nUpwell has denied appeals for preemptive surface
    security reinforcements on logistical and economic grounds. Various enterprising
    third parties have begun offering services to the colonies or exploiting their
    disruption. These organizations are wide-ranging, including the Order of St. Tetrimon,
    the Society of Conscious Thought, and even the Blood Raiders. \n\nMercenary contracting
    houses with controlling interests in the Agency network have deployed warbarges
    in orbit of the affected planets. From these, they are staging trials of Vanguard
    \u201Cfreelance\u201D deployments. Vanguard operating in these locations are accepting
    contracts from third parties and colony admins via the Agency's job brokerage
    framework, in addition to acquiring and extracting assets for personal use.\n\n---\n\n###
    News in Brief:\n\n- Battle in 1N-FJ8 results in over 4 trillion ISKs of destruction
    including Revenant, Vanquisher, and Komodo as well as first-ever Azariel-class
    Titan lost in open combat. \n\n- Upwell refuses to comment on emergent \u201Cmilitia\u201D
    threat.\n\n- Legion-coordinated Vanguard forces gain ground over Commando Guri,
    providing 40% of total suppression gains in Raihbaka.\n\n- Wormhole telemetry
    reports ships in Drifter deployments with new Drifter Recon Battleship.\n\n- CONCORD
    under fire following one year of insurgencies.\n\n- Trustbreaker deployment ends
    following continued Drifter attacks.\n\n- Sanmatar Shakor and Chairman Akimaka
    Saraki praise capsuleers for coordinated cooperation with TLF forces and Protectorate.\n\n-
