- body: "Derelik - Following Ammatar Consulate Governor Ana Utulf's broadcast encouraging
    Ammatar citizens to defect, the invasion of their space by the Elder fleet and
    the liberation of the Starkmanir tribe from their midsts, reports have come in
    of Ammatar Navy ships engaged in combat with other Ammatar Navy vessels. \n\nReports
    are coming in that mutinies have broken out on some Ammatar Navy vessels, with
    an uncertain number being commandeered by Minmatar sympathizers. Reports say that
    the majority of these vessels have begun broadcasting under altered transponder
    signals as \"Nefantar Tribe\" ships. \n\nEven among ships where the Ammatar Navy
    retained control, casualties are being reported by some crew. These casualties
    have hampered the Ammatar Navy's attempts at bringing a semblance of order to
    a region just recently plunged into chaos. Regardless, dozens of skirmishes have
    broken out between the two sides in the hours since the initial invasion. There
    have been unconfirmed reports of at least one Ammatar Navy capital ship defecting,
    with many other Navy ships unaccounted for."
