    their finger on the pulse of New Eden\u2019s tech scene: the Association for Interdisciplinary
    Research (AIR). The latest arrival to join the cluster\u2019s existing tableau
    of technology-driven corporations has made its first public statement with a series
    of bold proclamations.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/air_station_simulation1.png)

    In a press release sent to media outlets on behalf of AIR CEO Elida Balashirian
    and COO Daisuke Ojala, the corporation lays bare its ambitions: \"The Association
    for Interdisciplinary Research is proud to announce its debut onto New Eden\u2019s
    corporate landscape. By pioneering groundbreaking technologies, AIR seeks to disrupt
    the status quo for the benefit of all mankind. Our philosophy is one of radical
    independence; we believe in science beyond the borders of empire. Where others
    see limits, AIR sees possibilities.\"\n\n The statement elaborates on the corporation\u2019s
    immediate plans, including the simultaneous launch of AIR Laboratories, a subdivision
    of AIR focused on scientific research and development across multiple industries,
    and the AIR Capsuleer Training Program. The program, overseen by AIR Laboratories,
    claims to provide aspiring pilots with everything they need to become successful
    capsuleers, from the acquisition of necessary skills to discovering their long-term
    career goals.\n\n In response to the Scope\u2019s request for additional comment,
    AIR\u2019s VP of Operations, Vesper Calytrix said, \"In order to democratize the
    notoriously expensive capsuleer conversion process, AIR will cover the cost of
    all necessary training and medical screening for qualified aspirants. AIR espouses
    the notion that the vast reaches of space exist for the enjoyment and exploration
    of all, regardless of one\u2019s socioeconomic status.\"\n\n AIR was founded by
    two entrepreneurs who split from their respective corporations to create their
    own: Elida Balashirian, formerly of the Sisters of EVE, and Daisuke Ojala, formerly
    of the Ishukone Corporation. Inquires with both SOE and Ishukone confirm that
    Balashirian and Ojala departed those organizations in good standing. Those corporate
    connections appear to have proved integral to kickstarting AIR's research projects.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/air_station_simulation2.png)
    \ \n\n*Above: Combine TNR promotional simulation of new AIR station development*\n\n
    According to publicly accessible development plans, Combine TNR\u2014the Caldari
    corporate consortium of which Ishukone is a member\u2014is assisting in the rapid
    construction of several AIR stations across the cluster. Additionally, the Sisters
    of EVE confirmed to Scope that they will provide these new AIR facilities with
    equipment vital to AIR Laboratories\u2019 operations.\n\n \"The Sisters of EVE
    are thrilled to see our former colleague, Elida Balashirian, make a splash with
    the public launch of AIR. We wish her the best in all her endeavors and look forward
    to collaborating with AIR in the future,\" said SOE spokesperson Errin Buelle.\n\n
    Although sources for part of the new corporation\u2019s funding can be gleaned
    through public filings with the Secure Commerce Commission (SCC), the available
    documentation leaves a significant chunk of AIR\u2019s monetary wealth unaccounted
    for. A representative for the SCC responded to Scope\u2019s inquiry with a terse,
    \"No comment.\"\n\n While it remains to be seen how far AIR\u2019s sphere of influence
    extends, one thing is certain: the competition in New Eden\u2019s corporate sector
    is about to heat up.\n\n**In Other News**\n\n* Caldari State Authorities and Megacorporations
