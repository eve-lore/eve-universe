    Drifter threat has been ever increasing, with a significant incursion in the constellation
    of Homroon, with Nandeza, Dimoohan and Baratar being the current focus of the
    Drifters' attention. Due to the severity of the recent combat it has been difficult
    to define actual numbers, but it appears that that the Amarr Navy have suffered
    unprecedented losses in this conflict. At the time of writing, despite being present,
    the Amarr Navy were clearly unable to defend themselves against the increasing
    Drifter threat.\n\n \n\nDespite the apparent threat the Drifters pose, not every
    capsuleer in the system took a hostile stance against them. Several lone pilots
    have been known to fly close to the Drifters and survive.\n\n \n\nSome loyal readers
    may remember Makoto Priano from earlier news articles. He was present in a Manticore
    and was alone with six Drifters yet did not suffer a loss of ship or capsule.
    When asked for comment he said that \"The Drifters are out here in force. While
    it's not as concentrated a force as in Tukoss's video or during the Safizon attacks,
    there are still anywhere from four to twelve Drifters in a place, which may mean
    as many as several hundred in the five systems currently under attack. Needless
    to say, that's difficult if not impossible to fight by conventional means. This
    doesn't mean the Navy isn't trying, though. What's more, this area is tremendously
    isolated, and is frankly a bit of a backwater. With the losses expected from fighting
    the Drifters, it'll be difficult to keep pilots supplied with hulls, save by operating
    a jump service from Khanid space or perhaps Kor-Azor.\""
