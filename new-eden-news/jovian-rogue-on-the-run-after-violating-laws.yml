- body: A Jovian renegade, suspected to be in the early stages of the Jovian Disease,
    is on the run after he violated the non-interference law imposed by the Jovian
    directorate. The renegade gave away a hi-tech item to a person not an agent of
    the Jovian Empire. The directorate has already sentenced the rogue to the heaviest
    punishment possible, that of recycling his DNA upon capture. This is equivalent
    to removing the soul of a non-Jovian. It is also believed that the directorate
    is contemplating negating the effects of the renegade's crime, though how they
    plan to do this is yet unknown.
