- body: "Hedion - The Coronation of Jamyl Sarum as Empress Jamyl I that was due to
    be held tomorrow has been postponed one week, Chamberlain Hemirin announced today.
    The Chamberlain did not explain the change, but did note that the future Empress
    had approved it.\n\nSpeculation on the event is rife throughout the Empire.  Some
    point to several inauspicious events such as the recent disappearance of several
    Speakers of Truth enroute to the coronation; and an outbreak of Phyrezi fever,
    a short-lived but virulent and easily transmitted virus, which is spreading rapidly
    throughout Uriam Kador's domain. \n\nOthers point to rumors of an assassination
    plot against the Empress, though no clear evidence of such a plot has yet been
    presented in any open court. The Sarum Family has been operating an extremely
    strict security procedure in the weeks leading up to the ceremony, but Security
    Commander Pareh Mere claims that this is merely a normal precaution.\n\nWhile
    no firm reason has come forward for this change, the general mood in the Empire
    remains optimistic and its people seem patient."
