    Creations, and several hundred of the corporations work force left their jobs
    without notice in an alleged dispute with management over the corporations most
    recent contract. \n\nDuant, a project leader with Dark Amarr Creations, reportedly
    had strong objections to a newly issued contract from the Royal Khanid Navy for
    the construction of an Archon-class Carrier. Although Dark Amarr Creations has
    a long history in the construction of weapons and warships, to date its customers
    have always been private citizens, intent on having the best in self protection
    in an increasingly hostile galaxy. It is suspected that Duants only objection
    to this contract was that the source was a government agency, though exactly why
    remains a mystery. \n\nImmediately after quitting the corporation, with the _Equinox_
    in the early stages of its construction, Duant and the large group of Dark Amarr
    Creations employees that left with him formed a group known as the Ultra Unionist
    movement. At this moment the aims, motivations, and even the location of its offices
    and members remain undisclosed. Duant himself has not been seen since leaving
    the corporation, fueling speculation that he has gone into hiding from an as yet
    unknown entity. \n\nDark Amarr Creations have not remained idle, with control
    of the project shifting to Sharar Habacuc, another senior project manager with
    the company. Speaking at a hastily organised press conference, Dark Amarr Creations
    CEO Fuciea Vativa stated \u201Cthis corporation will still produce the Khanid
    Navy Archon on time, and on budget.\u201D When questioned about the significant
    loss of workforce Vativa replied \u201CContract opportunities will be available
    to pilots, who can contact Sharar Habacuc for details.\u201D \n\nAlthough perhaps
    on slightly shaky ground due to these events, the Royal Khanid Navy has shown
    their faith in the ability of Dark Amarr Creations to fulfill the contract, with
    spokesman Argen Senerva stating \u201CFor now we will trust Fuciea's judgement,
    and we will be monitoring the progress closely\u201D"
