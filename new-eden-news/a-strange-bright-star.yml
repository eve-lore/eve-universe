- body: "Astronomers gathered in the Aporulie system yesterday to attend a conference
    organised by the University of Caille to discuss the new stellar object that appeared
    in the night skies of planets across the Federation approximately sixty days ago.
    Key scientists in the field of astronomy and stellar physics shared their observational
    data on what is now being called one of the biggest astronomical conundrums in
    recorded history. \n\nUC Professor Kral Sangan, the chair and first speaker at
    the conference, outlined the nature of the problem. \u2018We have no idea what
    it is,\u2019 he said, \u2018we have had a much easier time determining what it
    is not. The true nature of the phenomenon is truly baffling.\u2019 \n\nThe explanations
    ruled out by the conference's panel of experts include a newly born star or recently
    exploded star. \u2018One thing for certain,\u2019 UC Professor Venter Joubrille
    stated unequivocally, \"is that it can\u2019t be any kind of star at all. The
    emission spectra are all wrong.\u2019 In his hour-long presentation, Professor
    Joubrille provided more details on the nature of these dilemmas. \u2018We know
    a great deal about stars and stellar formation,\u2019 he said, \u2018and we know
    that a star emits radiation at a specific number of wavelengths. And although
    we know that the emission spectra of a star will vary slightly depending on its
    exact chemical composition, broadly speaking when we observe a star we know what
    kind of data to expect.\u2019 It is generally understood that the object defies
    these conventions. \u2018The thing is a perfect black body,\u2019 the professor
    explained, \u2018the emissions are powerful, unbroken and fall across the spectrum,
    giving us very little insight into what the object is made from.\u2019 \n\nDoctor
    Hanno Brokkenheim of Hedion University continued the debate by examining some
    of the observational data in more detail. \u2018There is no discernible physical
    structure in the vicinity of the object,\u2019 he concluded, \u2018if it was a
    supernova, the ejecta from the explosion would be visible. Similarly, a large
    object such as a black hole would be detectable by its accretion disk and by its
    distinctive polar radiation. This thing has no structure at all. It\u2019s like
    an unbelievably hot singularity, that just popped into existence out of nowhere.\u2019
    \n\nThe second half of the conference was devoted to possible explanations of
    what the object could be. Professor Heins Yans of Caldari State University, another
    speaker at the event, put forth his theory that this might be humanity\u2019s
    first observation of a white hole, the theoretical physical opposite of a black
    hole. \u2018There really can be no other explanation for the level of energy being
    released by the object,\u2019 he said, evoking controversy and criticism from
    his colleagues. \n\nDoctor Yeldrem Bane of Renyn College of Astronomy was prepared
    to go even further. \u2018The laws of thermodynamics may not be the only physical
    laws that are being violated by this object,\u2019 he conjectured. \u2018If this
    object is two-hundred light-years away it would take two hundred years to reach
    us in the Federation, with a variation of several years depending on which system
    you are in. For its light to appear in every system in known space at the same
    time simply doesn\u2019t make any sense. We\u2019ve witnessed a physical impossibility!'
    \n\nThe conference closed without consensus, although all in attendance were agreed
    that the phenomenon is highly unusual and warrants detailed and protracted study
    by the academic community. The uncertainty however does play into the hands of
    armchair theorists and fringe groups, many of which see the new light in the sky
    as some kind of omen or portent."
