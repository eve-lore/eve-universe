- body: CONCORD has issued a warning statement of a suspected increase in pirate activity
    in the very near future. Experts on the situation believe that the pirates are
    intensifying their activity in response to dramatic increase in space travellers
    within regions traditionally associated with pirates. In order to acclimatize
    space farers to this new and dangerous situation the DED will make an exceptional
    effort to keep the pirates at bay, but these efforts can only be sustained for
    24 hours or so. After that the DED will leave the outer regions alone and those
    that travel into these areas will do so at their own risk. Thank you for listening.
