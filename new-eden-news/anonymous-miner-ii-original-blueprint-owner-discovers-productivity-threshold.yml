    controversial original Miner II blueprint released information that has galaxy-wide
    financial implications for both owners and consumers of advanced technology. \u201CWe
    discovered that we can\u2019t increase the production rate by copying the original,\u201D
    explained the corporation\u2019s CEO. \u201CThis is going to have a really, really
    serious impact on the way future tech will be produced--if the trend continues,
    there will be a lot of item monopolies created.\u201C \n\nA researcher from the
    anonymous corporation explains. \u201CA competent researcher requires 7 1/2 days
    to produce a copy that will produce 300 lasers\u2014the maximum number permitted
    from the copy. The factory can churn out a maximum of 48 lasers a day, so the
    only way I could increase productivity is if I could somehow copy the original
    in under 6 days. Even if my researching ability was at the highest skill level
    possible, that\u2019s still an impossible number to beat.\u201D \n\nThe CEO continued
    for the researcher: \u201CWe worked out that if the copy runs were at 100 hours
    as stated on the blueprint, we could, by continuous copying, increase supply over
    time. That way, if we managed to get a slow increase in production capacity, we
    were looking to drop the prices over time so our income remained the same, but
    Miner II production increased. The 1m isk Miner II would have been about a month
    away.\u201D \n\nAsked about how these discoveries affected their own marketing
    plan for the mining lasers, he replied \u201COur original plan was based on constant
    revenue for us, with rising production resulting in naturally falling prices.
    As it stands now, we're looking at a randomized waiting list, with a below-market
    rate price at about 2m per laser. But we'd have to check out our competitor\u2019s
    prices more fully, as we intend to be cheaper. \n\nWe asked when the anonymous
    CEO planned on going public with his identity: \u201CRight now that\u2019s purely
    a function of getting our online order processing system up and running. We\u2019re
    very concerned about customer satisfaction, and the best way to achieve that is
    by creating a reliable system for managing order flow. In the meantime, we\u2019re
    building up our supply to accommodate the anticipated initial burst of demand.\u201D
    \n\nThe CEO is hopeful that the system will go live by the end of this week, pending
    the successful completion of ongoing testing and debugging."
