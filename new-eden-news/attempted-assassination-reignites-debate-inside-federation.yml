- body: "The attempt made days ago on the life of Chamberlain Dochuta Karsoth has
    sparked renewed foreign policy debate inside Federation borders. Both in the corridors
    of power and amongst ordinary citizens, many have come forward to express often
    starkly contrasting opinions on how best to handle matters when it comes to the
    troubled Empire.\n\nWith a huge Minmatar subsection comprising Federation society
    that is only growing larger by the day, there was much festivity and even outright
    mockery of the recent challenges confronting both Chamberlain Karsoth and the
    Empire at large. In a few of the larger cities, streets were filled with impromptu
    rallies that used the event to renew calls for change inside the monolithic nation-state.
    Crowds consisting of predominantly Minmatar immigrants and Jin-Mei students waved
    placards and shouted chants of \u201CFinish the job!\u201D\n\nThis reaction lay
    in complete opposition to another perspective, championed largely by Intaki citizens,
    who expressed a deep concern with any change brought about by violence. Various
    influential Intaki-led political institutions and lobby groups pressed the case
    for the Federation to seek change only through diplomatic means. Some even called
    on the President to publicly condemn the assassination attempt. \n\n\u201CAny
    change achieved through violent means is illusory at best,\u201D stated Sieri
    Therese, an Intaki-born student who lives near Avey Square on Luminaire IV, where
    one of the rallies was held. \u201CAnyone who wishes for violence upon their fellow
    man is no better than a common thug. It was such a depressing sight to see my
    own people calling for such things and even reveling in the thought.\u201D\n\nHer
    comments were echoed by the lobby group \u201CPeace by Peace\u201D, a grassroots
    movement founded a year ago by billionaire Intaki artist Kirae Eillen, who authored
    a statement shortly after the news of the assassination attempt broke.\n\n\u201CAt
    this time we feel it best to remind the citizens of the Federation, and indeed
    the cluster at large, that true change cannot be forced or coerced. Diplomacy
    and the evident strengths of viable, tangible alternatives are the only truly
    effective and lasting catalysts for progress in a modern society. By the same
    token however, we submit to Chamberlain Karsoth that there is a reason for the
    recent attempt made on his life. He must pay closer attention to the people he
    has been tasked to represent.\u201D\n\nSpeaking on the matter to the Federation
    networks, University of Caille professor Saul Cassel, an expert on the various
    political institutions across the nations, claimed that the assassination attempt
    was \u201Cjust the latest symptom of a deeply broken system.\u201D\n\n\u201CEven
    if they do not realize it, the people of Amarr are struggling against a tyranny
    and oppression which is rife amongst the institutions of power inside that nation,\u201D
    he said. \n\n\u201CThe Amarrians are more than entitled to their religious beliefs
    and no sensible person would deny them such. What any rational individual must
    take issue with, however, is the way in which their religion is used as nothing
    more than a blunt political instrument, a means through which to oppress and silence
    dissent, to make a grab for power and privilege and then abuse it. It is this
    dire political situation that is driving such regrettable actions as we have seen.\u201D\n\nCassel
    refuted the claims made by many that the situation was simply a power struggle,
    stating \u201CI think that would be an overly glib analysis\u2026it is far more
    than that. It is clearly a people realising that in such corrupted soil, the seeds
    of democracy cannot be sown. They will cleanse the earth with blood if they have
    to and that much is becoming increasingly apparent as their representatives take
    drastic actions, all too aware that they have a popular mandate to do so.\u201D\n\nSo
    far there has been little official comment on the matter outside of a brief and
    carefully worded press release delivered yesterday by Presidential spokesman Yuri
    Meureux, who had been continually mobbed by the media as they pressed for a comment
    from Foiritain himself. \n\n\u201CWhilst we understand the renewed concerns and
    are closely listening to each and every perspective, there is nothing further
    to say on the matter at this point in time. We will continue to work tirelessly
    towards a measured and constructive foreign policy approach, just as we have always
    done. In a democracy decisions are not made until sufficient time has passed for
    each voice to be heard and considered.\u201D\n\nMany have interpreted the remarks
    as a careful sidestepping of the issue, as the President tries to avoid alienating
    one side or the other. It is undoubtedly a difficult situation for him and other
    political and legislative officials, who must carefully balance the fears and
    hopes of a wildly divergent populace that has grown more fragmented in recent
    years. Where some call for diplomatic resolution, others rally for more direct
    methods, pointing to the Federation\u2019s growing economic might to be used more
    assertively. \n\nIt is assumed from the press release that for the time being,
    however, the President and others will be keen to see the current level of commotion
    die down and continue talks on the matter in calmer times."
