    Akira, notable for exposing details of the SOE's presence in Thera, has alleged
    that the new \"Alpha\" cloning technology recently developed by the SOE combines
    data from the SOE's Project Discovery, research from the Sanctuary's scientific
    outposts in Thera, and techniques hitherto unknown to New Eden's scientific community.\n\nSpeaking
    exclusively to the Scope, from a secure location in the Aring system, Taya Akira
    warned that the Sanctuary's research in Thera included exploration of \"profoundly
    dangerous remnants of technologies touching on neurocybernetic adaptation and
    artificial intelligence\". Akira, now the leader of an SOE splinter faction calling
    itself \"Pharos of Thera\", went on to explain that she and her group had been
    monitoring the SOE's Project Discovery, and believed it to be aimed at \"a complete
    understanding of Drifter, which is to say Jove, biology whether natural, adapted
    or profoundly altered by integration with artificial life systems\".\n\nTaya Akira's
    starkest warning came with her claim that \"the combination of Thera research
    with Project Discovery findings is dangerous in its own right, but my sources
    within the Sanctuary have told me that a new technique has been added to the mix
    and that this has unlocked the new cloning technology the Sisters have given to
    the core empires\". Asked to explain the danger, Akira would only say, \"Anoikis,
    Thera and the Drifters are dangerous beyond any threat you can imagine. All of
    humanity must beware of the danger and not blindly fall into a trap of our own
    making.\"\n\nThe Sanctuary and the Sisters of EVE leadership issued a brief comment
    on the claims when approached: \"Our former Sister Taya Akira was a brilliant
    scientist but the tragic events that took place in Thera during YC116 took a great
    toll on her, physically and we feel sure emotionally. We would willingly welcome
    her back and help her to recover from that terrible experience. Nevertheless,
    with all respect for Taya, we must reject the claims of danger involving our hugely
    successful Project Discovery efforts and most certainly with regard to the new
    cloning technology that is vital to the ongoing defense of humanity during the
    Drifter Crisis.\"\n\n![](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/70666/1/seeker_and_citadel.png)

    efforts against the Drifters, the DED 's Genesis Fleet command has commended the
    efforts of such capsuleer groups as the [Arataka Research Consortium](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/interstellar-correspondents/the-spotlight-arataka-research-consortium/)
    (ARC) and the [Special Empire Response for the Assault and Penetration of Hives](https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=496651)
    (SERAPH). A recent engagement between capsuleers associated with SERAPH and a
    combined Circadian Seeker and Drifter tactical group resulted in the destruction
    of more than 20 Seekers and 50 Drifter vessels in the Sazre system.\n\nSERAPH
    associate Morwen Lagann had some days earlier placed an Astrahus-class citadel
    in close proximity to the Jove Observatory in Sazre, to observe Seeker and Drifter
    activity. Imagery supplied by Lagann indicates Seeker investigation and engagement
    with the citadel. SERAPH commander Alizabeth Vea has suggested that Drifter activity
    in the system is a direct response to the citadel's proximity to the observatory,
    although this has not been confirmed by DED intelligence's Drifter analysis group."
