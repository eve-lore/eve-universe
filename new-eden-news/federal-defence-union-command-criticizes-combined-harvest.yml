- body: 'Dastryns - The outbreak of illness on a Dastryns station last month continues
    to baffle medical personnel and is now creating tension between Combined Harvest,
    the company linked to the Long-limbed roe suspected of causing the illness, and
    the Federal Defence Union, the Gallente militia organization formed after the
    Caldari invasion.


    Placid''s proximity to core Gallente Federation holdings and the value of the
    Intaki homeworld makes it a strategically valuable region, and it is defended
    vigorously by the FDU. With the illness limited to a Federal Administration Bureau
    station in the contested region, some in the FDU administration have openly speculated
    that the illness was a deliberate attack and that Combined Harvest''s policies
    are to blame.


    Widely criticized by the FDU, Combined Harvest uses a combination of corporation-owned
    convoys and independent capsuleers to move goods, a security hole the FDU wants
    closed.


    "It''s certainly a possibility," commented Fari Gorsh, a professor and military
    analyst. "If you wanted to disrupt the [Federal Administration] Bureau''s work
    out here, disrupt relations with Intaki, and give the Caldari a chance, all it
    would take is one determined saboteur. With something as vital as food, it is
    surprising that a company would place the welfare of the Gallente Federation at
    such risk."


    Combined Harvest has refused a request from the Federal Defence Union to release
    specific transfer manifests for the shipments of Long-limb roe to destinations
    in Placid, claiming the information would harm the company''s competitive advantage.'
