    in our galaxy, especially under the rule of the current president Foiritan, has
    always come up short when it comes to defensive shield technology. The Gallentean
    designs are never quite as good as the Caldari or the Minmatar, which has forced
    them to focus more prominently on ships\u2019 defensive armour plating.   \n  \nGallentean
    scientist have for years been trying to improve their shield systems, making them
    stronger, more durable and with a quicker recharge rate. But what they\u2019ve
    always lacked is experience in using the systems which they design, a handicap
    which may have more of an effect on their work than perhaps was previously realised.
    \  \n  \nSeveral weeks ago, a Gallentean citizen made a breakthrough in shield
    technology, setting a new Galactic record for the fastest total recharge of shields
    on a battleship, a time of 87 seconds. Yet this person isn\u2019t a scientist.
    She is a pilot, with many years of experience in the systems which she is utilising.
    And it is that experience which allowed her to achieve this record.   \n  \nUsing
    a combination of some of the most sought after equipment in the galaxy, her skills,
    honed over countless hours of spaceflight, and a 'Gnome' KYA2000 implant, Pottsey
    managed to achieve a passive shield recharge rate of 109.6 units per second. Well
    beyond the damage capability of most capital weapons. Although the Dominix battleship
    is incapable of mounting weapon-systems, due to the total dedication towards shield-recharge,
    the record is still a formidable one.   \n  \n\u201CMy idea was to covert a mark
    5 Gallente Industrial ship to a research ship for deep space. The ship needed
    to be able to withstand regular hits to the shields from electromagnetic storms
    like we find around the Eve gate.\u201D Pottsey said, recounting her first experimentations
    into passive shield recharge. \u201CBeing a research ship, my idea was to make
    the shield recharge so fast you can just forgot about the shields and get on with
    the important jobs like taking readings from the probes\u201D. During an early
    test of the modifications in an asteroid belt, she was ambushed by Serpentis Mercenaries,
    but her designs worked so well that they were incapable of penetrating her shields
    past 60%, exceeding all expectations. Systems checks indicated that she had the
    capability of bringing the shields up to full status after just 37 seconds of
    having them deactivated.   \n  \nShe progressed onto battleship based passive
    shields when it became apparent that this ship, although very defensively capable,
    would require an escort for some missions. So after more weeks testing and procuring
    equipment, Pottsey perfected the systems she had installed on the dominix.   \n
    \ \nPottsey is now working on an Iteron mark 3 version of her technology but says
    she is being hampered by the rarity of Shield relay II\u2019s and Shield Flux
    II\u2019s.   \n  \nScientists, stunned at the new benchmarks they had to work
    their technology towards, were quick to comment that due to all of the specialised
    equipment involved in achieving this record, it would be unlikely that any commercial
    model would appear or quite a while.   \n  \nNevertheless, this revelation has
    had a quiet effect on the armament industries, with more then a few scientists
    redirecting their attention towards the natural recharge of shield systems. What
    this means for the future is unsure, yet is clear that once again, innovative
    pilots can break the boundaries of science."
