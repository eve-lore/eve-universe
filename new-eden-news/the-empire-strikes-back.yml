- body: "DED investigators tracked down and ambushed cohorts of the prison transport
    hijackers in a shock dawn raid on a Society of Conscious Thought School. \n\nThe
    DED have announced that following the recent destruction of a CONCORD prison transport
    vessel they were tasked with tracking down the perpetrators and dismantling any
    infrastructure they may have. \n\nAfter carefully interviewing residents and informants
    in the Geminate region a connection was found to the Society of Conscious Thought
    School in FDZ4-A, in the vicinity of planet eight. \n\nDED carefully planned a
    dawn assault on the school in order to minimise any potential resistance, surprise
    was guaranteed as officials at the establishment were not notified. \n\n\"It went
    according to plan, once the main station building was breeched we found what we
    were looking for. At this time I can tell you that we were looking for six suspects,
    all six were found, two of these terrorists were taken alive,\" revealed Commander
    Haram Goskaktar, DED's head of security. \n\nIdmei Sver, the chief executive officer
    of the Society of Conscious Thought said shortly after the raid: \"It's outragous,
    attacking a school, however I have been assured by a DED advisor that the school
    is not suspected in any way and that they were after some cartel scum disguised
    as students. They have tons of evidence from their quarters so let's hope all
    this mess was worth it.\" At this point Sver was firmly led away by DED officials
    and was overheard being told not speak to the press. \n\nIn a final twist to these
    events the Jovian directorate have issued a statement on the raid. As the majority
    shareholder in the Society their words carried much sway. All the moreso given
    that it is believed to be the highest governmental authority in the Jove Empire,
    though this has never been confirmed by the Jovians. \n\n\"The DED conducted a
    raid on a Society of Conscious Thought School to apprehend terrorist fugitives.
    All but two suspects were killed during the raid. The directorate fully cooperates
    with CONCORD in continuing the struggle against these hijackers. The DED have
    now finished evidence gathering at the school and we will be informed of any developments
    regarding the former students. Until then it's business as usual,\" said Chief
    Advisor Kalmaran Dophar. \n\nCONCORD and DED have refused to reveal any further
    details of the assault."
