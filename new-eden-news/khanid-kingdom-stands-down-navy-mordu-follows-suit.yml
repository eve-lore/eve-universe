- body: "Khanid Prime - Following the withdrawal of the Elder taskforce to Minmatar
    space and the reactivation of CONCORD responses across the cluster, the Khanid
    Navy has stood down from its full alert status. A large amount of naval forces
    have withdrawn to their normal patrol routes away from the Empire-Kingdom border.
    The Royal Khanid Navy remains on tactical alert, ready to respond in the event
    other unexpected circumstances come to light. However, the Navy has stepped down
    from full alert. \n\nAn address from Khanid II has helped to calm fears among
    the Khanid populace. No Minmatar incursion into Khanid space has been reported
    and holders report that their slave populations are still under full control.
    \n\nMinutes later, a statement from Mordu's Legion Command announced that they
    too were returning to base, and underlined the fact that they had not at any point
    been involved in hostilities beyond a few small skirmishes with Guristas vessels."
