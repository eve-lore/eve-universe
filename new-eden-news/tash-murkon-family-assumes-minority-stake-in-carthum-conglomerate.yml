    major shareholders, the Lai Dai Corporation and the Sarum Family, have agreed
    to a special stock issue for the purpose of raising capital from the Tash-Murkon
    family. The deal, signed yesterday, gives the Tash-Murkon family a 9% stake in
    Carthum in return for a cash outlay 5% below the current market price for Conglomerate
    stock.\n\nThis deal is the end of what has been nearly a month-long search for
    solutions to Carthum's cash flow problems, which began to cause serious problems
    for the company's stock price last month following a particularly disappointing
    earnings report. Until last week, negotiations between Carthum and a number of
    suitors appeared to have stalled for various reasons. According to sources in
    the company, the Tash-Murkon family wanted considerably more influence on the
    company's board than the Sarum family and Lai Dai were willing to give.  \n  \nHowever,
    following Catiz Tash-Murkon's abbreviated visit to Kador Prime last week, the
    royal house seemed to become much more flexible on the issue, dropping a number
    of more far-reaching demands. The deal as signed gives the Tash-Murkon family
    a significant stake in the company and a seat on the board, but for the most part
    control of the company remains firmly in the hands of the Sarum Family and Lai
    Dai. Some are speculating the compromise may have been arrived at in order to
    curry favor with the Empress, but so far neither the Tash-Murkon Family nor the
    Conglomerate are discussing the deal."
