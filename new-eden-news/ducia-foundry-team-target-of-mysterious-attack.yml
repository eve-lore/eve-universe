    Following up on an anonymous report, The Scope has obtained classified sensor
    data from a Sisters of Eve search vessel sent deep into w-space. The operation
    was undertaken at the request of Ducia Foundry for the recovery of a team which
    was reported missing earlier in the week. The leaked sensor data reveals damage
    visible on recovered ships and outpost structures which is minimal and does not
    follow known Sleepers attack patterns. All members of the missing team are as
    yet unaccounted for after a thorough search of the mining outpost. Ducia Foundry
    spokesman Youd Rassosa has declined to comment at this time."
