    warning of a possible world-shattering plasma wave approaching the planet. Several
    spaceports have been forced to turn away approaching dropships as the boarding
    gantries have been overrun with panicked residents fighting for space aboard the
    next transport.  \n  \nSCOPE News has maintained contact with several reporters
    trapped in the cities of Southern Cross and Valimor. They have sent word that
    many residents within the vast underground caverns have made no attempt to leave,
    peacefully enjoying what could possibly be their final moments alive. Despite
    the lack of power in many parts of the cities, they report that there is an eerie
    calm in the deepest levels, forged perhaps from the resignation that there is
    little chance of escape.  \n  \nThe unofficial rescue count currently stands at
    843,000 residents. CONCORD and the Federation Navy have ceased cooperating with
    news agencies at this time."
