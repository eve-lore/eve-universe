- body: "Amarrian loyalist forces dealt a blow to the Ushra'Khan alliance last Sunday
    evening by destroying a Starbase that they believed was a terrorist training camp.
    The Starbase was located deep in space that is claimed by the Minmatar alliance.
    Representatives of the 70-man fleet claimed this action as a direct response to
    the destruction of an amarrian Holder, Jamir Torash, by the Ushra'Khan Alliance,
    an event that took place last week. The U'K itself later condemend the action
    as \"a petty revenge attack for the death of a Holder, who was killed by the incompetence
    of his own pilot and son.\" \n\nThe attack commenced with the forming of a squadron
    of PIE Inc. interceptors, that raced into the heart of the Minmatar Republic,
    intending to deliver an ultimatum to the Republic citizens at Pator. PIE Vice
    Admiral Rodj Blake called on the citizens of the Republic and its government to
    condemn terrorism and the murder of Jamil Torash. Blake went on to declare that
    \"time is quickly running out for the Mimatar government\". Should they \"fail
    to act against the viper\" in their midst, a statement referring to the U'K, all
    Minmatar should \"leave Republic territory\" because every Mimatar that remained
    within supported a government whose policies included aiding known criminals.
    \n\nBraving the locals' jeers and insults, Blake then offered supplies of Vitoc
    antidote to any Minmatar wanting to return to slavery in the Empire. After this
    the PIE Inc. interceptor squadron turned around to join a gathering of loyalist
    plots there. After arriving in Amarr, they joined CVA, 1st Praetorian Guard and
    Paladin Imperium fleet consisting of battleships, cruisers and support. Various
    smaller allies were also present. After a brief mass, they struck out towards
    territories known to belong to the Ushra'Khan, later joined by two Archon Carrier
    and three Revelation class Dreadnought. \n\nThey met a force of Ushra'Khan warriors
    guarding their target in the system of YWS0-Z. After sizing up the enemy, the
    force warped to the facility and unleashed their laser-fire on the starbase. The
    relatively small defence fleet was not capable of thwarting the attack, despite
    their best attempts. \n\nAfter forcing the base into reinforced mode, the bulk
    of the Amarrian fleet was engaged by a 20-odd group of U'K pilots. The fleet held
    its own, waiting for the fuel to run out in the tower. During the wait, they assaulted
    another Starbase and put it into reinforced mode, even though this facility was
    more heavily defended then the other. \n\nAfter the first tower got out of reinforced
    mode and was open to attack, the fleet continued to evaporate the \"Minmatar Cultural
    Education Centre\", giving no quarter. Vice-Admiral Blake, speaking for PIE. Inc.
    was satisfied: \" I think you can see that this was no simple educational facility!,\"
    referring to the bases' defences. \n\nSpeaking for the CVA alliance, Reash of
    Imperial Dreams corporation said, \"the CVA will always stand with Amarr and we
    shall not back down to terrorists who threaten to murder innocent civilians, we
    urge all loyal citizens of the Empire to show the foul terrorists of the Ushra'khan
    the same treatment as we do.\" It was later confirmed that the strike was dedicated
    to the memory of Holder Jamir Torash and that a medal in honour of the late nobleman
    would be conferred on all participants, by the CVA itself, in the \"vengeance
    operation\". \n\nResponding for the Ushra'Khan, Admiral Maggot of Freelance Unincorporated,
    said, \"The paramilitaries murdered students and tutors in a peaceful facility.
    This shows they truely fear the Minmatar.\" The Ushra'Khan leader went on to affirm
    the intention of the alliance to rebuild stating, \"This is a terrible tragedy
    for those who lost lives, but we must not let such foul deeds sway us from our
    goal. Next time the facility will be heavily defended.\" \n\nPressed on Amarrian
    claims that the facility was a terrorist training camp, Maggot declared that,
    \"the facility taught tribal customs, Minmatar lore, and basic skills useful to
    all young Matari. Sadly we will need to work hard to find tutors of such good
    quality. [...] It seems even the destruction of a school is acceptable to these
    evil zealots.\" The Admiral confessed himself a little taken aback by the size
    of the attacking force saying, \"The enemy fleet has not been seen in such numbers
    for over a year and we must take note of their renewed strength.\" However he
    promised the defiance of the Ushra'Khan was unchanged closing his remarks with
    the battlecry \"Death to Slavery!\""
