- body: "CAILLE - Although the recent reports indicate that the Seyllin I catastrophe
    was triggered by natural causes, lots of Gallente citizens seem to put the blame
    on the Caldari State. Spontaneous anti-Caldari demonstrations are breaking out
    across the Federation planets, and although no clashes with the police were reported
    yet, many fear that the situation may escalate to full-blown rioting.   \n  \nThousands
    of protesters, waving signs and shouting 'Murderers!', have gathered at the municipal
    council building in Caille. The city officials have approached the protesters,
    trying to calm the crowd down, but the tensions still remain high. One of the
    protesters, a social worker Jenna Riousse, has told The Scope: 'We have seen before
    just how devious can the Caldari be - I am sure that they are behind this now.
    There can be no peace with these animals!'  \n  \nThe riot police in Caille were
    put on heightened alert several hours ago; no clashes with the civilians were
    reported so far. Gallente authorities have also tightened the security around
    the Caldari State diplomatic facilities in Luminaire and other Federation planets."
