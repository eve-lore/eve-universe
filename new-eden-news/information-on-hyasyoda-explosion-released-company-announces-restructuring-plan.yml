    Hyasyoda, today provided reporters with information regarding recent reports of
    an explosion at a Hyasyoda facility in the Urlen system. \"It was a secret project.
    [CEO Ahtonen] Osmon was obsessed with the creation of new mining laser technology.
    A significant amount of ISK was diverted from other company projects to secure
    funding.  \n  \n\"The project's leaders were secretive and paranoid,\" said Zehiman,
    \"and getting worse with every rumor about ORE's development of another capital
    ship. Few people outside the Urlen station knew about it. When something went
    wrong in the research lab, Public Relations was instructed, in no uncertain terms,
    to ignore everything: the research, the project, the people, even the explosion.\"
    \ \n  \nWhen asked about his reasons for leaving Hyasyoda and divulging classified
    corporate information, Mr. Zehiman responded, \"I couldn't stomach covering up
    the death of hundreds of scientists and workers, and the silent failure of a costly
    project. The only way to take a stand was to leave Hyasyoda and tell my story,
    and hope the New Meritocracy rewards my honor.\"  \n  \nHyasyoda has yet to reveal
    what led to the explosion or the extent of the damage it caused, but made other
    news today by announcing a massive corporate restructuring due to \"unforeseen
    market changes\" and \"reduced working capital.\" All Hyasyoda divisions have
    been directed to examine costs and evaluate projects, and to expect substantial
    downsizing. CEO Ahtonen Osmon and other Hyasyoda executives refused requests for
    an interview."
