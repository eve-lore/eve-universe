    Commission\n\n \n\nFor immediate release to all registered capsuleers:\n\nIn accordance
    with the Planetary Development Treaty, which will come into effect on June 8,
    YC 112, capsuleers will be permitted full access to surface resources, allowing
    them to purchase and operate facilities on most planets in New Eden and in wormhole
    space.\n\nThe SCC has reviewed all possible scenarios that accompany the rapid
    expansion of capsuleer influence in the cluster and has decided unanimously that
    it will not be placing any artificial limit or restrictions on the acquisition
    of planets. In light of this, CONCORD is issuing the following recommendations
    to all capsuleer alliances, corporations, and individuals interested in managing
    planetary assets:\n\n  * Seek planets outside of known high-traffic systems\n
    \ * While CONCORD will maintain its efforts to keep peace in high-security systems,
    it cannot guarantee complete safety\n  * Early preparation is highly recommended
    - ensure that your skills, equipment, and research are updated\n\n\n\nThe SCC
    is confident that this treaty will usher in a new era of unity between capsuleers
    and planetary populations, forging a stronger economy in every corner of New Eden.\n\n
