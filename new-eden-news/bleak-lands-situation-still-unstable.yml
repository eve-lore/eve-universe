- body: "Haras - A variety of unaffiliated sources have reported that strikes continue
    to be made against Amarrian facilities in The Bleak Lands. \n\nIn the early hours
    of the morning, a 7th Fleet communications array in an isolated sector of Haras
    was destroyed. Reports from survivors have positively identified the attackers
    as the Minmatar organization called the Defiants. \n\nThe communications facility
    is one of several recently established by Admiral Saracen's 7th Fleet and was
    reportedly under guard by a detachment of Navy vessels. The Navy engaged in a
    brief but ferocious fire fight, leading to the eventual destruction of the communications
    facility. According to initial reports, the facility itself was the main target
    of the attack. The Defiants only turned their weapons on the Amarr Navy vessels
    after the facility had been destroyed. Witnesses have stated that the attackers
    sustained numerous casualties, with several ships retiring from the engagement
    heavily damaged. There are some concerns as to whether the communications tower
    was boarded during the firefight, but no confirmation of this has yet filtered
    in. \n\nThe 7th Fleet has refused to officially comment on the attack and have
    since ordered all non-command personnel to refrain from speaking with reporters.
    \n\nLess than an hour following the destruction of the Naval facility, a supply
    depot belonging to House Torash on the far side of the system was attacked and
    destroyed. Representatives of House Torash have declined to comment, but it is
    widely suspected that the raid was conducted in order to loot local resources
    to fuel the Defiants escalating operations in the area."
