- body: "This afternoon in an undisclosed system in The Forge, as Qualifier 5 for
    the Wiyrkomi Corporation's COLOSSUS team was getting underway, a contestant activated
    her weapons before the race was officially started, pod-killing two of her fellow
    contestants despite being explicitly warned by race coordinators that such behavior
    would result in disqualification.   \n  \nThe Caldari Gaming Commission has reacted
    to the news with much anger, immediately disqualifying the contestant in question
    and barring her and her corporation from any further sporting events held under
    the Commission's auspices.   \n  \n\"It's an absolute outrage,\" stated Airas
    Sukela, head of the Commission. \"The blatant disrespect shown not just to the
    other contestants, but to the Commission and the Caldari State itself, is nothing
    short of a travesty. Completely outrageous.\"   \n  \nQuestioned as to his thoughts
    on those contestants who were killed, Sukela stated, \"Yeah, that's terrible too.\"
    \  \n  \nState officials have remained tight-lipped as of yet regarding what action,
    if any, will be taken against the Curse Alliance, of which the offending contestant
    was a member.   \n  \n\"Obviously if these states are to be taken as sovereign
    entities in their own right, they must demonstrate that they are able to keep
    their subjects from willfully destroying honest-to-goodness sporting events held
    by other nations,\" said Kisiras Haakenen, Caldari Executive Panel Director of
    Public Relations. \"The Panel has not decided to take any action as of yet, but
    it does feel that at this juncture a formal apology to the State would not go
    amiss.\"   \n  \nThe qualifier, the last of the Wiyrkomi qualifiers, went ahead
    as scheduled. The COLOSSUS Qualifier season is slated to end Friday, October 8th."
