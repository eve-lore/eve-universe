    the help of pod-pilots on one of their field research projects.   \n  \nDr. Palask
    and Dr. Stubbs from Independent Studies Corporation have been carrying out diverse
    studies on the Amod Rogue Drone hive for the last week; according to Dr. Stubbs
    the research team located a number of \u201Cinteresting technologies\u201D inside,
    yet was for the moment unable to reach them for lack of enough combat forces to
    keep the Rogue Drones at bay.   \n  \nThe Hive is rated 5/10 by CONCORD; IS corporation
    is on the lookout for pod-pilots capable of providing the firepower to allow IS
    scanning units reach the structures in question."
