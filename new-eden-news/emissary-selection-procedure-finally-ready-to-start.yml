- body: "The customary legal wrangles, that always surround every major public election
    in the Federation, are finally coming to an end. Now that the fierce court room
    scuffles are over, the battle can move into the public arena, where freelance
    corporation vie for the honor and prestige of getting to select an Emissary from
    their own ranks. As usual the candidates have tried to gain an advantage over
    each other by suing and counter-suing each other, hoping to come out cleaner in
    the ensuing mudslinging. While political analysts relish the court room dramas
    and love reading deep meanings into every simple gesture, the public quickly tires
    of the whole farce.   \n  \nThe candidates have spread their envoys throughout
    the Federation, ready to hand out assignments to those wanting to experience the
    vibrant democracy exercised by the Federation first hand, and perhaps win a Navy-issue
    Dominix while they're at it. While the name of the game is to find the most fervent
    supporters of the candidates, the candidates are not above putting their adoring
    pilots to work. After all, it should weed out the gold diggers and leave only
    those truly worthy to be participants in the great democratic traditions of the
    Federation."
