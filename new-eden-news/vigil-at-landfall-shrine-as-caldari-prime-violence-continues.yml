- body: "New Caldari \u2013 As riots and a bloody police response continue on Caldari
    Prime, thousands of Caldari have flocked to the Landfall Shrine, one of the most
    sacred places in the State, to hold vigil for the victims of the violence. With
    clashes between Caldari expatriates, anti-Caldari extremists, and police showing
    no signs of ending any time soon, citizens from all over New Caldari and surrounding
    systems, including a number of Panel representatives, have visited the shrine
    to light candles, burn incense, and leave flowers. Pictures of those loved ones
    on the other side of the Federation border litter the site. \n\nOn Sunday, according
    to caretakers in charge of administering the temple grounds, nearly a half a million
    people visited the shrine, more than twice the usual number of daily visitors.
    \u201CIt's unprecedented,\u201D said Airos Ogemi, chief steward of the Shrine.
    \u201CI've not seen anything like this in my time here.\u201D \n\nMost visitors
    have stood vigil quietly, with silence being the usual custom within the Shrine's
    walls. Many, however, have been overwhelmed with emotion, and have broken down
    crying, especially those with loved ones on Caldari Prime. \u201CI haven't heard
    from her in days,\u201D said Waras Yamatumi, about his cousin Pakimato. \u201CThe
    CRC says the communications node to Caldari Prime is overwhelmed and the Federation
    is prioritizing official traffic. They said it could be until next week before
    I hear anything.\u201D \n\n\u201CI just don't understand why this is happening,\u201D
    said Otsio Fukikaga, another visitor. \u201COur people have lived on Caldari Prime
    in peace since the end of the war. Why are they attacking us now? Maybe Tibus
    Heth is right; they just can't be trusted.\u201D Showing us a picture of her daughter,
    she covers her mouth with her hand. \u201CShe went there last month to work on
    an archaeological dig for the STI; she was so happy. Now, I don't know if I'll
    ever see her again.\u201D"
