- body: "The Caldari State has agreed to open a fraud investigation into the Caldari
    Gaming Commission\u2019s (CGC) recent activities, sources revealed yesterday.
    This follows repeated requests from the Mercantile Club and the Caldari Business
    Tribunal that an inquiry be made into the CGC's accounting history. \n\nThe CGC
    has promised its full cooperation in the investigation. A spokesman said they
    expect to be cleared of all suspicion once the investigation has been concluded
    and its outcome is presented to the public. \n\nA Mercantile Club security officer
    recently discovered footage of a meeting between high ranking members of the CGC
    and their accountants, where they are seen discussing the option of tax evasion.
    The officer gave the holoreels to his superiors, who in turn presented them to
    the Caldari Business Tribunal. \n\n\u201CEven though the Club prides itself on
    our private meeting chambers, it was our decision in this case that concealing
    possible intent of grand-scale tax evasion would go against our values as a proud
    corporation of the State,\u201D said Temikko Aikikonen, Mercantile Club spokesperson.
    \n\nThe Caldari Business Tribunal has decided to involve the Chief Executive Panel
    in the prosecution of the CGC, as the CEP would stand to be the largest beneficiary
    of the allegedly owed taxes. A committee is currently being formed that will lead
    the investigation and eventually present its findings to members of the Business
    Tribunal and the CEP. The committee will be lead by Prof. Sari Hazel, a Gallente
    specialist in criminal fraud, well known for her work during the Religious Donation
    Trial several years ago."
