    Nation continues its raids into Empire space, the number of those abducted rises.
    While official numbers report over two million missing, the stark reality is that
    many of those abducted remain simply a number on a ledger.  \n  \n\"Approximately
    one million are reported missing from Schmaeel,\" stated a Kor-Azor family official
    tasked with keeping track of the raids. \"However, we have a list of names numbering
    barely half that many. We know the numbers are right, but we do not know the full
    identities of those missing.\"  \n  \nThe Amarr Empire isn't alone in having these
    problems, as large numbers of missing civilians from colonies in the Republic,
    Federation, and State also remain unidentified. According to recent reports, nearly
    thirty percent of the colonists abducted by Sansha's Nation remain unidentified
    by their empires.   \n  \n\"It's a simple matter of logistics,\" said Sister Amia
    Kathis of the Servant Sisters of EVE. \"Many of the colonies being assaulted by
    the Nation are remote and poorly defended. Census reports may be years or even
    decades old. Say a new colonist arrives days before the Nation attacks. Who will
    miss them? Who will report them missing? What records will state they were ever
    there?\"   \n  \nKathis is one of many in the SSoE who is trying to uncover the
    identities of those missing. \"We owe it to those poor people to figure out who
    they are. Imagine suddenly vanishing from existence and no one caring. It's a
    terrifying thought.\" According to Kathis, efforts have been stymied by the empires'
    reluctance to allow outsiders access to census records.  \n  \nAmong the four
    empires, the Caldari State has been the most diligent about identifying its missing
    citizens. Currently, nearly 90% of those taken from Caldari worlds have been identified.
    Asked for an explanation, PR representative Yukuro Shiba of NOH said, \"All colonists
    are employees of a corporation. Discovering who is missing is a simple task of
    cross-checking corporate rosters.\""
