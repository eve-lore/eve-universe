- body: "Illuin \u2013 Scope News has learned that the Minmatar-Thukker force which
    is responsible for igniting a war in New Eden are the Minmatar \u201CElders\u201D,
    the legendary ancient leaders of the original seven tribes. If true, this claim
    would validate the Republic\u2019s official denial of involvement with the Amarr
    invasion, and of the Republic Fleet\u2019s defensive posturing along the Amarrian
    border. \n\n**Editor\u2019s Note:** Under normal circumstances, Scope News would
    discredit this claim. However, given the Thukker Tribe\u2019s alignment with the
    attack force, the apparent mass-defection of millions of Ammatar civilians, their
    ancient affiliation as the Nefantar tribe, and the resurgence of the Starkmanir,
    we made a collective decision to publish this news with a \"caution\" disclaimer.
    These are extraordinary times, and on behalf everyone at this agency, we implore
    all of you to remain vigilant as these unprecedented events unfold. \n\n_Posted
