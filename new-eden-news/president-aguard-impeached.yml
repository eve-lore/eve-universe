    Gallente President Impeached Following Senate Inquiry\nPresident Celes Aguard
    has been impeached by the Gallente Federation Senate following the results of
    an inquiry into her conduct in office. The trial was rushed through following
    an impassioned speech by Senator Lucas Tenzin, who blamed Aguard for \u201Ca drop
    in the quality of life for the Federation's poorest citizens matched only by the
    rise in our disenfranchisement\u201D.\n\nThe inquiry was originally organized
    in response to the failure of the Gallente to claim one of the five Drifter Wormhole
    systems despite Aguard suspending the regularly held election. The investigation
    raised concerns over the failure to rally support around the Gallente\u2019s bid
    for Drifter Wormhole access and flagged possible unconstitutional abuses of power
    in Aguard\u2019s extended delay of the Presidential election. The strongest evidence
    of misconduct, however, was discovered in the President\u2019s actions following
    the passing of the Automated Industry for Democracy Act (AID act) in YC125.\n\nThe
    investigating committee presented the Senate with evidence of a cover-up. Reports
    were uncovered of Rogue Drone emergences throughout the Gallente industrial sector
    following the passing of the AID act, which reduced restrictions on AI intelligence
    in the industrial sector. According to the committee, this was an issue of public
    safety and should have been disclosed to an appropriate Senate oversight committee.
    Instead, Aguard ordered the Federal Intelligence Office to hire capsuleers to
    aid in covering up these events through black budget payments listed as \u201CEmergency
    Aid\u201D. \n\nFollowing the publication of these findings, Senator Lucas Tenzin
    of Everyshore led calls for an immediate impeachment trial. The trial was conducted
    swiftly, and Aguard\u2019s impeachment was ratified in an emergency Senate session
    last night. Political commentators across the cluster have credited the swiftness
    of these proceedings to Aguard\u2019s plummeting polls and growing unpopularity
    within her own party.\n\nSenator Tenzin, an independent with no party affiliations,
    called the impeachment \u201Ca blow for justice, long overdue.\u201D He explained
    that, \u201CFormer-President Celes Aguard has worked to hide the truth from the
    people, to hide the true cost of her AID act, all while failing to support those
    very citizens who lost their jobs because of her policies.\u201D Senator Tenzin
    has long been a critic of the AID act. He has achieved soaring popularity in his
    Everyshore district after expanding welfare opportunities for those miners who
    lost work as a result of increased automation.\n\nCeles Aguard\u2019s own party,
    the Progressives, has been split over the decision. The party\u2019s more conservative
    members have largely remained loyal to the Aguard, calling the impeachment an
    outrage. The majority, however, voted for the motion to impeach.\n\nSenator Suvio
    Bellaron, who once ran against Aguard in the YC122 election, called the impeachment
    \u201Ca shameful end to a promising career.\u201D When asked if he planned to
    run for President in the upcoming election, he was quick to answer, \u201CNot
    at all. My time fighting for the big chair has passed, but today has shown that
    there are many in the Senate willing to pick up the torch.\u201D\n\nAguard has
    been removed from office, effective immediately. The Senate Head, Speaker of the
    Chamber Andon Gardieu, will act as the head of an interim government until proper
    elections can be held. Celes Aguard refused to respond to accusations, telling
    reporters that \u201CDespite the accusations of my critics, the people of this
    Federation have always been my top priority. I can only hope that my successor
    has what it takes to make the tough choices our Federation needs.\u201D\n\n###
