    Sarum Family have been sighted crossing into The Throne Worlds.


    While the passage of Amarr Navy capital ships is an occasional sight within Imperial
    borders, this particular movement comes after the Emperor Family confirmed yesterday
    that Empress Jamyl Sarum I would personally visit the Mekhios Graveyard this weekend

    While their destination at this stage is still unconfirmed, it is believed that
    they are en-route to the system of Amarr.'
