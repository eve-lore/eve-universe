- body: "As reported by the Scope this morning, according to documented sources from
    within the Republic Parliament, \u201Ctop people\u201D in the Republic\u2019s
    governmental infrastructure have been involved in secret talks with representatives
    from the Ammatar Consulate for the past six days. The talks, all of which took
    place on Minmatar soil, covered such wide-ranging subjects as POW exchanges, Ndorian
    mining rights and the retraction of several long-standing war crime accusations
    on both sides.   \n  \nIt is not known at this time whether an end to official
    hostilities between the two nations is on the cards, though the news has prompted
    widespread speculation that this may be the case. The news has been greeted with
    tremendous furor in both the Republic and the Mandate, in particular from anti-appeasement
    segments of both populations.   \n  \nPrime Minister Karin Midular moved swiftly
    to head off the outcry, broadcasting a speech across the Republic this afternoon.
    The full text of the speech follows:   \n  \n  \n\u201CMy fellow people of Matar.
    \  \n  \nI fully understand the outcry over the recent revelations. I am here
    to assuage your fears and explain our reasoning. I would appeal for your composure
    and attention.   \n  \nWe have been in a state of war with the Nefantar since
    the creation of our beloved Republic. War is a terrible thing. All of us know
    our history and none of us can deny this simple fact. Throughout time, wars have
    been fought for conquest, for plunder and for freedom. But this war, which has
    gone on so long and cost us so much, has been fought for one simple reason: hate.
    \  \n  \nAs a people, we possess a lot of hate, and perhaps rightly so. No other
    people in the history of our universe have suffered so much in the cause of tyranny
    and sacrificed so much for the cause of freedom. But is this all we are? I choose
    to believe not. I choose to believe we are better than that, that we can rise
    above such hatred. Though we may spit their names today through clenched teeth,
    I choose to believe we may one day look upon our kin and feel an emotion other
    than hatred. Did not the great Kiaor himself say: \u2018Those whom you hate so
    fervently, you must have once loved so deeply?\u2019   \n  \nI will not deny that
    the path in front of us is long and arduous - that there exists an almost insurmountable
    gap between our peoples - but I will do all within my power to bridge it.   \n
    \ \nWe have lost so much. Let us not, in the throes of hatred, lose yet more.\u201C
    \  \n  \nThe speech, the first Republic-wide broadcast by Midular for over a year,
    seems to have quitened unrest in the short term. Though Matari everywhere continue
    to voice their confusion and discontent, the angriest voices have stopped shouting.
    Even among the Tribal Council, one of the hotbeds of the ever-present appeasement
    debate, a vote has been passed pledging support for continuing talks with the
    Ammatar.   \n  \nThe Ammatar and the Matari have been in an official state of
    war ever since the Great Rebellion 129 years ago. While the intensity of the fighting
    has ebbed and flowed, the peak was hit 7 years ago as a long-term Matari offensive,
    dubbed the Vindication Wars, came to a close at the Battle of Tears, one of the
    highest-casualty engagements in recorded history. Since then, the two nations
    have settled into a tense stand-off. With the exception of the occasional skirmish
    no fighting has taken place, and the borders of both nations have remained secure.
    \  \n  \nNo information has been publicly released as to when and where the talks
    will continue."
