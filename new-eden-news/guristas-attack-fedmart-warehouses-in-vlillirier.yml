- body: "Vlillirier - Two storage and warehousing facilities belonging to FedMart,
    the largest retail corporation in the world of EVE have been attacked by forces
    believed to belong to the Guristas pirates. The raiding force included a large
    number of transport ships, and it is clear that the Guristas were intent upon
    plunder after sweeping away the few customs forces and naval pickets guarding
    the system. \n\nAlso present in the system were a number of Wiyrkomi storage and
    warehousing facilities, though these remained unmolested by the pirates, leading
    many to speculate that the Caldari State gave tacit approval for the raid. This
    speculation is further reinforced by the fact that the few Wiyrkomi Peace Corps
    forces present in the system did not respond to distress calls issued by FedMart
    personnel."
