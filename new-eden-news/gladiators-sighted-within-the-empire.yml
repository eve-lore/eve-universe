- body: "Reports have recently been pouring in that the escaped gladiators have been
    sighted within the borders of the Amarrian Empire. Armed with ships and modules
    that would put most private armies to shame, the ex-slave warriors carved a route
    through the heart of Amarrian space, reportedly searching for a new place to call
    home.   \n  \nStarting in the Imperial system of Mai, they plotted a course taking
    them through Zaimeth, Khopa and Penirgman, where they reportedly got into a war
    of words with the locals, repeatedly referring to them as heretics and blasphemers.
    Although nobody engaged the Gladiators directly, it is clear from the witness
    statements they were heavily armed and ready to take on any who would have tried
    to oppose them.   \n  \nInformation on the gladiator\u2019s exact plans is sketchy,
    however it is widely believed by those present that the gladiators were scanning
    systems for a suitable place set up a new arena. An individual named \u2018Custo\u2019
    was also mentioned by the gladiators several times; however his relation to the
    gladiators and their plans is as yet unknown.   \n  \nThe gladiators were last
    seen leaving Penirgman, possibly heading to Raravoss, but they have since gone
    unaccounted for and their currently location is unknown."
