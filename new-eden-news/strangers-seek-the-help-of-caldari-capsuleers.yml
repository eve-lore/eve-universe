- body: "Two unusual persons were reported to have entered a Caldari communications
    channel this Sunday afternoon, apparently requesting assistance from the capsuleer
    pilots in attendance.   \n  \nThe individuals who were of Caldari and Intaki lineage,
    and have not been named, were apparently seeking aid in acquiring a number of
    electronic parts.   \n  \nSuspicious of their intentions, the patrons of the galaxy
    wide FTL communications channel - which is provided for capsule pilots of Caldari
    nationality as an open forum, reacted with a large degree of hostility to the
    visitors.   \n  \nDespite the refusal of many Caldari pilots to aid the interlopers
    in view of their secretive nature and the presence of the Intaki, several enterprising
    individuals did choose to assist them in achieving their objective.   \n  \nThe
    names of those pilots involved in these dealings were not disclosed, apparently
    as a result of fears their outraged compatriots would retaliate. At this time,
    the exact reasons for this remarkable request are unclear."
