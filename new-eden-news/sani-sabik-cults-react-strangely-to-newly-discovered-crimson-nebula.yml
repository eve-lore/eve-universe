    has provoked a strange reaction among the normally stealthy Sani Sabik cults of
    the Amarr Empire. On planets and stations across the Empire, Sani Sabik cultists
    are going out on the streets, wearing ceremonial robes in concourses, and chanting
    prayers. The Amarr Ministry of Order is suppressing any cultists revealing themselves
    in this manner.


    Outlawed as heretics, the Sani Sabik are usually extremely cautious, but some
    among the blood-oriented cults see significance in the crimson nebula. Some cultists
    view this phenomena as a sign of the endtimes.


    "These are people used to carrying out their rites in utmost secrecy, like any
    heretic in the Amarr Empire," said Doctor Arvasal Szillo of the University of
    Caille''s Department of Comparative Religious Studies. "From what I can tell,
    they are considering the crimson nebula as confirmation of a Sani Sabik prophecy
    detailing a ''cloud of blood blanketing the universe'' at the end of all things."


    The Amarr Empire refused to comment on the activities of those Sani Sabik who
    have revealed themselves. A spokesman for the Ministry of Order stated, "Troublesome
    elements have been removed from our streets in line with Amarr law."'
