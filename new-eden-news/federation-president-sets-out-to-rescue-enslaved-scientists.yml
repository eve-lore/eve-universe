- body: "The public, and especially the science community, is distraught over the
    fate of scientists Touvolle and Umailen, pioneers of the now defunct Crielere
    program. Now Federation President Foiritan, acting under his own initiative, has
    decided to employ his considerable political clout to get the scientists back
    from the clutches of Articio Kor-Azor. Foiritan's interests in science and hi-tech
    gadgets, interests that some say border on obsession, have made him many friends
    in the science community, and it is believed that this act is intended to bolster
    those relations, as well as earn him public fame as the a liberator of the famous
    scientists.  \n  \nFoiritan has already dispatched his most experienced and trustworthy
    diplomats to start negotiations with Articio for the release of the scientists.
    Inside sources say that the diplomats were given a 'carte blanche' by Foiritan,
    in essence giving them free reign to offer Articio most anything in exchange for
    Touvolle and Umailen.  \n  \nThe Federate Senate has already, not surprisingly,
    denounced Foiritan's decision as 'foolish and potentially wasteful'. The Senate
    fears that the President's love for science may blind him from upholding the best
    interests of the Federation and may recklessly give Articio concessions that can
    cost the Federation dearly in the long run. Foiritan's supporters within the Senate
    have been strangely silent on the whole matter, their only contribution so far
    being a speculation over the true value of the scientists, whether it is purely
    driven by humane interests or whether the scientists possess some secret knowledge
    of the magnitude that makes leaders of nations bicker about them. Truly valid
    speculations indeed and worth getting answers for."
