- body: "As tensions between the Khanid Kingdom and CONCORD rise, we are left wondering
    how the Amarrian people are taking this. One source within the Amarr Navy, one
    that wishes to remain anonymous, claims that tensions between individuals that
    believe in CONCORD's leaked memorandum and those that don't are the direct result
    of the lack of information forthcoming on Emperor Doriam II's assassination.   \n
    \ \nThe source, a fairly well-off officer, claims that certain factions within
    the Navy are less then happy with CONCORDS investigations, believing that the
    Empire itself is more then capable of taking care of their own.   \n  \n\"The
    Empire should not bow to the bureaucrats of CONCORD. For thousands of years we
    have been able to take care of our own problems. Regicide is a crime that should
    be treated with the utmost diligence and CONCORD's interference makes a mockery
    of traditions started when some civilizations were still in their cradles. It
    is an insult to the Empire.\"   \n  \nAttempts to confirm this were met with harsh
    words. One private in the Navy, however, was willing to expound, also wishing
    to remain anonymous.   \n  \n\"I can't believe Chamberlain Karsoth even allows
    outsiders to investigate this matter. It is an internal Imperial affair. This
    newly \"leaked\" memo changes nothing.\"   \n  \nWhatever the truth of the matter,
    it can only be blow to the ego of the Amarrians to have CONCORD investigate the
    assassination. To some, the leaked memorandum can only mean that they are not
    doing a very good job. Meanwhile, Amarrians, Khanid and the other Empires await
    further, official statements of the matter."
