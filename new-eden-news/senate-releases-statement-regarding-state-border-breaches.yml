- body: 'ALGOGILLE - In a joint statement released by the Office of the President
    and the Federation Navy this morning, the Federal administration offered an official
    response to the leak of details from the Operation Highlander after-action dossier
    regarding a number of illegal breaches of the Caldari Border between the dates
    of October 6, YC110 and March 10, YC115.


    In the statement, Grand Admiral Anteson Ranchel confirmed that "a number of missions
    were planned and executed outside the Federation Navy''s usual sphere of operations
    between these dates. All action was solely for intelligence gathering purposes,
    and all operations were both passive and observatory in nature, with no offensive
    orders issued to the personnel deployed."


    The Office of the President also added that "these operations were vital to Federal
    security in the wake of Caldari aggression during the YC110 invasion of Luminaire,
    and the subsequent invasion of Ratillose by forces under the command of Amarrian
    heir Uriam Kador."  The Navy release reiterated that "the Federation Navy and
    Federal Intelligence Office will continue to take every action within its power
    to keep its borders secure from breach by hostile military forces, and will continue
    to work with the Directive Enforcement Department to halt in its tracks any threat
    to the people of the Gallente Federation and their homes. We now consider this
    matter closed, and have no further comment to make."


    Less than thirty minutes after its release, the statement was met with a charged
    response from Odo Hakaalen, Corporate Relations Director for the Chief Executive
    Panel, who reiterated that "any potential intelligence gathered by these unlawful
    border breaches has no tangible use for tactical advantage, and was accrued during
    the years that the Caldari State was under Provist administration". Continuing,
    he also stated that the Caldari Navy "would like to make our position expressly
    clear for reasons of transparency and offer caution that any further unauthorized
    breach of the Caldari border will be met with the use of full lethal force."


    Despite being mentioned in the initial statement from the Federal administration,
    sources within the Amarr Empire appeared to brush aside requests for comment.'
