- body: "Professor Corin, an instructor of Electronics and Engineering at the Science
    and Trade Institute School, made an appearance their communication channel last
    night. Apparently, Professor Corin has been using his spare time to research some
    possible enhancements to the firmware of Damage Control units and was recruiting
    some former students to assist in the acquisition of more units. While he was
    not specific as to the effects or ultimate goal of his research, he did mention
    that because he was only able to continue his research because of the assistance
    of the pod pilot community, he would of course share his discoveries with the
    masses. \n\nAccording to reports, Professor Corin was requesting assorted Damage
    Control units in order to install his new firmware upgrades for testing purposes.
    Apparently, Professor Corin was unable to purchase said units due to the 'pitiful
    state of our pay scale' and was instead trading miscellaneous skill books for
    the modules. The skill books apparently came from the basement and previously
    overlooked cabinets. \n\nUnlike some of his lectures this get together under Professor
    Corin was actually well attended and he looked forward to seeing his students
    at some later date because he wasn\u2019t finished collection all the units needed
    for his research."
