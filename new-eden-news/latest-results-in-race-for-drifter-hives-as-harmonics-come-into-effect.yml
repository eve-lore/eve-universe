    Race Continues as Harmonics Research Published\n\nSignificant changes in research
    and development at Crisis sites across the cluster after the first week of the
    newly dubbed \u201CRace for the Hives\u201D. Thousands of capsuleers have joined
    the competing factions in their efforts to develop means to occupy the Drifter
    Wormholes. Only the top five factions will be able to put their new technology
    into effect and occupy one of the five Drifter Wormhole systems.\n\nResearch has
    also finally been completed on the Warden Connection Harmonics recovered by capsuleers
    from Tabbetzur. A heavily redacted research paper published by the Caldari State\u2019s
    School of Applied Knowledge has shown that harmonic sequences can be constructed
    in order to open up a backdoor to the Warden in Zarzakh. This backdoor is based
    on accessing a network of hyperspace connections that are routed through the Warden
    itself. \n\nIt is theorized that this network is connected to the hyperspace telemetry
    used to predict Drifter activities, and their wormhole systems. Because of this,
    access to the Harmonics provides a significant advantage in the research and development
    of methods for Drifter Wormhole occupancy.\n\n### Race for the Hives Results in

    total contributions received up to this point:\n\n- Triglavian - 29.1% (down 17.2%)\n-

    Impact of Harmonics\n\nInformation was leaked today by an anonymous source including
    an analysis of what the research progress would have been without the advantages
    gained from access to Warden Connection Harmonics. If this information is correct,
    it tells an interesting story about how the Harmonics have impacted the current
    situation.\n![Race Harmonics Impact](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/7ldB6hcRD6mxBVMGqv0oUi/fae5bfc4b72c907fb77e840c3c4d6413/Race2_Harmonics.png)\n*Red

    majority of Harmonics gathered by capsuleers were handed over to the Minmatar
    Republic. It was the Republic Fleet that carried out Operation Harmony Breach
    in Tabbetzur, the two military strikes that revealed the Harmonics to New Eden.
    The second-highest number of Harmonics were given to the Triglavians (almost half
    as many as the Minmatar), with the Caldari receiving the third most (a little
    over half as many as the Triglavians). \n\nDespite these generous submissions,
    the shift towards the Minmatar slightly negatively impacted the overall positioning
    of these first- and second-place factions. This impact would have been notably
    greater were it not for the Harmonics they received from dedicated capulseers.\n\n__Top

    - chief6 (EverMore)\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe Triglavians have seen a significant
    reduction in their lead. Despite that, they remain the clear front runners with
    almost double the share of the Caldari second position. More and more Capsuleers
    continue to flock to the Triglavians, with their long history of conflict with
    the Drifters and their powerful technology. \n\nThe Caldari have risen to second
    place thanks to a growing group of dedicated capsuleers who have carried them
    from fifth to second place. This rise is only fitting considering their rapid
    response to the Drifter threat that was pushed back in New Caldari last week.
    The capsuleers who triumphed over the Vigilant Dreamer in New Caldari were awarded
    the Honor of Landfall medal by Chairman Akimaka Saraki. In an announcement by
    the Landfall monument on New Caldari, Saraki praised those who had fought for
    the Caldari\u2019s capital system as \u201Cwar heroes who understand the importance
    of duty.\u201D Seventy-seven capsuleers received the medal, including one of the
    top Harmonics contributors, Remilia Malitia. \n\nSaraki went on to caution against
    the rising support for the Triglavians; \u201CThey stole our worlds and plunged
    our stars into darkness. Long ago these masked invaders abandoned their humanity
    to the Abyss, along with their honor. We must trust ourselves and our State in
    this coming fight. It is we Caldari who are the cluster's best hope for victory.\u201D\n\nThe
    Angel Cartel has slid into fifth place, a slim fraction behind EDENCOM. Security
    forces throughout the cluster are reporting rising crime indicative of massive
    shifts in New Eden\u2019s underworld as the Cartel\u2019s operatives make ready
    for the new technologies they hope to gain.\n\nEDENCOM is the only new group to
    enter the top five, having made a huge rise from their initial seventh position.
    Provost Marshal Kasiha Valkanir delivered a speech to the CONCORD Assembly urging
    them to invest in EDENCOM; \u201CChairman Saraki and the other leaders of the
    CONCORD member nations are mistaken if they think going it alone is going to win
    them this war. A single nation cannot stand against the Drifter threat. EDENCOM
    is a dedicated specialist force. It was we who held the line against the Triglavians,
    and we are the only ones capable of shutting down the Drifters once and for all.
    Once more we are ready to stand against any who would threaten our way of life,
    not for one nation, but for all humanity.\u201D\n\nThe Amarr have fallen out of
    the top five despite a positive impact on their relative position due to Harmonics.
    The Royal Palace has declined to comment on the shift. While the Royal Houses
    still present a united front, there are rumors that critics of the Empress have
    blamed their declining progress on her failure to inspire the faithful. The Gallente
    Federation has continued to struggle as well, unable to rise from seventh place.\n\nThe
    SOCT has begun slowly advancing but has only climbed to eighth place. EverMore
    has fallen to last place despite acquiring a significant number of Harmonics.
    Upwell has similarly failed to inspire dedication in the capsuleers of New Eden.
    These two massive corporate entities attempts to compete with the major nations
    and the military forces of New Eden have so far failed to bear fruit. While the
    Consortium has declined to comment, President of EverMore Alexander Ducasse gave
    an interview to IMN affiliates this morning stating that \u201Cthe competition
    is not over yet, and while we may not have the numbers of nations like the Caldari
    or Triglavians, I can assure you EverMore is not to be ignored.\u201D\n\n### News
