- body: "Myyhera - Taking advantage of the current turmoil around Sarum Prime and
    the retreat of the 7th Fleet from The Bleak Lands region, the Blood Raiders have

    lost all power for as long as an hour, leaving any pilots within vulnerable. With
    both CONCORD and Ammatar forces floundering amidst the confusion, there has been
    no confirmation or denial of the raid. \n\n_Posted 16:24 GMT_"
