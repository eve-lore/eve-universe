- body: The Gallente Federation and the Caldari State today released a joint statement
    declaring that the research center in Crielere, jointly built by the two empires,
    has now been completed. The new research center is expected to spearhead research
    activities for both the Gallenteans and the Caldari. Scientists from both the
    empires have hailed the news and are very optimistic it will pioneer many exciting
    new technologies in the near future. The opening is also seen as a breakthrough
    operation in bringing the former nemesis states back together. Officials in Crielere
    have also expressed their great joy of being able to activate the center so soon
    despite several setbacks. They admitted they had anticipated the construction
    to take longer, but said they were happy to be proven wrong. The record construction
    time surely testifies to the great construction techniques these two empires command
    and clearly indicates the great benefits that co-operation can bring.
