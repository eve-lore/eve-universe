- body: "Three days ago, Joshua Foiritain received the first privately owned Federation
    Navy Comet from his contact at Roden Shipyards. Junnader Crucarne of the Shipyards
    stated that he was pleased to be able to offer the ship to such a loyal and hardworking
    freelancer.   \n  \nI had the opportunity to interview Mr. Foiritain,   \n  \n**Hitzu'kai
    Brena:** How does it feel to have been rewarded with such a ship?   \n  \n**Joshua
    Foiritain:** I\u2019m happy and scared at the same time, it\u2019s an amazing
    ship but the insurance doesn\u2019t cover its true value.   \n  \n**Hitzu'kai
    Brena:** Do you intend to fly it actively?   \n  \n**Joshua Foiritain:** I will
    keep flying it during flights where I do not expect to get shot at. I won\u2019t
    risk it in combat though.   \n  \n**Hitzu'kai Brena:** What were you required
    to do, in return for the ship?   \n  \n**Joshua Foiritain:** Junnader Crucarne
    wanted me to execute certain criminals who had attacked some of his miners a week
    or so ago.   \n  \n**Joshua Foiritain:** I was required to deliver DNA samples
    and identity tags of these Criminals.   \n  \n**Hitzu'kai Brena:** Was it difficult
    to acquire the items?   \n  \n**Joshua Foiritain:** It was quite a search; I spend
    three days after I was contacted by my agent searching.   \n  \n**Hitzu'kai Brena:**
    But you found the items, and now you're the proud owner of the Navy Comet   \n
    \ \n**Joshua Foiritain:** Yup, I did have help searching though. A pilot named
    Cadenceca assisted me in finding the last missing pieces. He unfortunately would
    not accept a reward for doing so.   \n  \n**Hitzu'kai Brena:** What do you think
    of the ship, so far? Combat capabilities, speed, and the like?   \n  \n**Joshua
    Foiritain:** It\u2019s a very nice ship; the only downside is the small capacitor.
    \ \n**Joshua Foiritain:** It has a very nice slot layout which allows a good amount
    of equipment to placed in and of course it looks amazing   \n  \n**Hitzu'kai Brena:**
    How long have you worked for Roden Shipyards?   \n  \n**Joshua Foiritain:** Difficult
    to say, I worked for Roden Shipyards several months ago and took a break when
    one of my corporations moved to Caldari space. I resumed working for them with
    a friend about one and a half weeks ago.   \n  \n**Hitzu'kai Brena:** Apparently,
    they appreciate you enough to offer you the Comet!   \n**Hitzu'kai Brena:** Would
    you like to say something in conclusion?   \n  \n**Joshua Foiritain:** Id just
    like to Thank Cadenceca again for all his help.  \n**Joshua Foiritain:** It really
    made the searching go a lot faster.   \n  \nWe concluded the interview after that.
    \  \n  \nAlthough this is the first of the Navy Comets to be offered to a person
    outside the Federation Navy, it is likely not to be the last one. For now, though,
    it is the only one available, although Mr. Foiritain assured me that the ship
    is not for sale.   \n  \nWhere the Comet travels next, is not known. Perhaps you\u2019ll
    see it soon, in a system near you, piloted by the lucky Joshua Foiritain."
