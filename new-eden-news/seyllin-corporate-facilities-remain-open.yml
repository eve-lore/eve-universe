- body: "SEYLLIN - While forces rapidly evacuate the Seyllin systems, both Roden Shipyards
    and CreoDron announced in a joint statement that their facilities would remain
    open to new docking for as long as station managers deemed it safe. Neither CONCORD
    nor Federation Navy officials would comment on the safety of the stations from
    the plasma event threatening Seyllin I.  \n  \n\"We are still accepting as many
    ships as our docking bays can hold.  For those ships that can't get out-system
    for whatever reason,\" the statement read, \"we are here to provide a safe haven.
    Our facilities, like many others, are crowded and strained, but we are ready to
    go the extra mile in order to save lives.\"  \n  \nThe stations' defenses can
    be considerably hardened, but doing so requires all docking bays sealed and shield
    integrity boosted, preventing inbound and outbound traffic from passing through.
    As the extent of the damage potential from the system event is not known at this
    time, station officials could not comment on the extent of potential damage to
    the station."
