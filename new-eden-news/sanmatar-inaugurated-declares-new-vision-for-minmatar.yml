- body: "Pator - The ceremony to officially grant the title of \"Sanmatar\" to Prime
    Minister Maleatu Shakor took place this morning on Pator.  The Sanmatar, which
    is now the formal title of office, thanked the assembled dignitaries for the honor
    and stated that this was simply the first step towards creating a new system of
    government for the Minmatar people.  \n  \nSanmatar Shakor then went on to outline
    his vision for this new government with the formation of a council of tribal heads
    to replace the parliament as the decision making body for the Minmatar Republic,
    a return to a state where a tribe has full control over its internal affairs and
    a reunification of all seven Minmatar tribes under one nation.  \n  \nHe then
    went on to say \"we're not a people that are easily led and the road to this end
    will be long and hard\" but added that \"in the end, we will be able to stand
    and say, we have a Minmatar government, ruling a Minmatar society, peopled by
    all tribes of the Minmatar.  That prize is worth any hardship\"."
