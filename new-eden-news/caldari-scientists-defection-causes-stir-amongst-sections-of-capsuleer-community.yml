- body: "**ERAM -** The defection of Zainou scientist Hilen Tukoss has provoked calls
    for sanctions against his new employer Eifyr & Co. in addition to the offer of
    a 750m ISK bounty for his assassination.\n\nOnly a day after giving his [interview
    to The Scope](http://www.eveonline.com/news/newsFromEve.asp?newsID=4650 \"Read
    the previous article.\"), former Zainou employee Hilen Tukoss issued a communication
    to the Intergalactic Summit. Titled Arek'Jaalan, the release notified the capsuleer
    community of his intent to establish two communications networks:\n\n\"I'd like
    to establish a series of communication networks to enable a greater flow of information
    between various capsuleer individuals and organizations. This network serves the
    specific purpose of unifying capsuleers with an interest in researching and discussing
    Sleeper technology and history, Talocan technology and history, Wormhole Space
    exploration and archiving, as well as any matters that relate to those.\"\n\nFor
    his actions so far, including this latest offer, Tukoss has been met with some
    strong responses from the small subset of the capsuleer community that frequents
    the Summit. Despite the well-wishers and offers of support, Tukoss' release was
    quickly followed up by two others of a decidedly more antagonistic nature.\n\nLai
    Dai partner[ Lai Dai Infinity Systems](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Lai_Dai_Infinity_Systems_%28Player_corporation%29
    \"Public Information Portal\") (LDIS) [issued a call for capsuleer sanctions](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1548418
    \"Intergalactic Summit Release\") against Eifyr & Co. products. Although this
    cause is unlikely to garner widespread support without increased publicity and
    pressure, the communication is understood to have rattled some Eifyr & Co. employees
    and investors nonetheless.\n\n\"A widespread capsuleer boycott on Eifyr & Co.
    products is the absolute nightmare scenario. Eifyr depends to a significant extent
    on capsuleer income to sustain their other projects,\" said a senior consultant
    with Irukemi Financing, a hedge fund that specializes in biotech products across
    the empires.\n\nIn addition to calling for a boycott of Eifyr & Co. products,
    LDIS CEO Dex Nederland also advised against participation in the Arek'Jaalan project.
    \n\n\"All State loyal corporations and capsuleers should minimize their trade
    in and use of Eifyr and Co. products and avoid supporting the _Arek'Jaalan_ project.\"\n\nDespite
    these actions, LDIS has not yet promoted the idea that capsuleers should actively
    work against Tukoss or his followers, although their press release arguably set
    the stage for more violent condemnations.\n\nIn another conversation on the Intergalactic
    Summit, capsuleer Vikarion of the State Trade Consortium [offered a 750m ISK bounty
    for the permanent death of Tukoss](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1548659
    \"Intergalactic Summit Release\"), and double that for his successful capture
    and return to Ishukone for trial under State and Corporate laws. Vikarion offered
    the following rationale in the same communication:\n\n\"Hilen Tukoss-hnolku had
    many options besides treason. He could have moved to another corporation. He might
    have appealed to higher authorities. He could have asked any Caldari loyalist
    for employment or funding. I personally would have been happy to contribute billions
    towards pure research, which is what he claims to want. And yet, he chose instead
    to spit in the face of his country and aid its enemies.\"\n\nBoth the LDIS boycott
    and bounty contracts are expected to reach limited numbers of capsuleers, but
    that has done little to assuage the fears of some.\n\n\"So far, Tukoss has probably
    only reached a few hundred capsuleers at most,\" said one participant in the Arek'Jaalan
    project, \"with even less actually getting directly involved in the sharing of
    research and information. He will have to raise that number significantly if he
    really wants to affect the sort of changes he speaks about. At this early stage,
    any kind of well-organized resistance could slow that task down considerably,
    or even kill interest in it entirely.\"\n\nGiven his recent actions it would appear
    that Tukoss is trying to build a capsuleer coalition; an understandable goal for
    someone who has made as many enemies as he has. Yet in addition to that overarching
    problem, it seems Tukoss now must also fight for attention and goodwill in the
    few public arenas open to him, such as the Intergalactic Summit.\n\nIf the varied,
    and at times violent, capsuleer reactions are any indication then the honeymoon
    of positive attention and PR for Eifyr & Co. is waning, and the reality of increased
    tensions is making itself hard to ignore.\n\n**  \n**"
