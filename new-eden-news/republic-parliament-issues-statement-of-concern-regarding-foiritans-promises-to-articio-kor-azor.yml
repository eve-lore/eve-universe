    hope that our friends in the Federation continue to exercise caution and responsibility
    in their efforts to recover the Crielere project scientists.\u201D Citing concerns
    over the rumored concession of trade and mining rights to Gallentean border regions,
    Republic Parliament made the statement, \u201Cin hopes of expressing our profound
    concern over the safety and inviolability of Republic Sovereignty in areas adjacent
    to the Gallentean Federation.\u201D   \n  \nPresident Foiritan is believed to
    have given Articio Kor-Azor, son of the Amarr Emperor, rights to trade routes
    and resource locations in systems within Gallentean space that are not only home
    to significant numbers of so-called Gallentean Minmatars, members of the large
    ethnically Minmatar diaspora that make their home in Federation space, but also
    strategically closer to Republic seats of power than any previous Kor-Azor or
    Amarr controlled area.   \n  \nThough the specificities of the agreement President
    Foiritan has made with Articio Kor-Azor are unknown, at least one private sector
    intelligence agency is claiming the reported \u201Ctrade and mining rights\u201D
    granted to Articio in exchange for the return of the Crielere scientists Umailen
    and Touvolle will lead to the de facto annexation of Gallentean systems by Articio.
    Articio Kor-Azor, son of the new Amarr Emperor, appears to be amassing both power
    and material resources, and this agreement is seen as both a conduit to express
    that new found power and a source of even more wealth and influence both at home
    in Amarr regions and beyond."
