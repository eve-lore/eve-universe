    Caldari cities due to the actions of a CEP-classified \u201Cterrorist group\u201D
    known as the Brothers of Freedom. Disillusioned citizens have taken to the streets,
    often in violent confrontations with the authorities. \n\nLead by Melarius Torvil,
    the Brothers of Freedom claims to be working towards the \u201Crestoration of
    the Caldari people and the Caldari ideal\u201D. Their repeated claims to bring
    an end to alleged corruption and self-serving nature of leaders within the State
    has resonated amongst a vocal section of the public, who have taken up arms in
    an oftentimes brutal service of this cause. \n\nDuring the riots and violence
    sparked by the organization however, over ten thousand State citizens have been
    injured or killed, with thousands more displaced due to damages done to residential
    and commercial districts. The damage caused by their actions is reported to be
    considerable, causing significant damage to planet-side economies and threatening
    to impact the space-bound economic balance if the situation continues to decline.
    \n\nThe significant harm already caused by the Brothers of Freedom has cast widespread
    doubt in many circles over the sincerity of their claims and the ideals they allegedly
    espouse. The death toll on both sides of the conflict continues to climb, adding
    considerable numbers to the already alarming loss of life caused by scuffles such
    as the [May 12th incident](\u201Chttp://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=1457&tid=6\u201D)
    in New Caldari.\n\n\u201CI just don\u2019t see who it is they are supposed to
    be helping with this violent pursuit of their objectives,\u201D stated Masani
    Ahkam, a prominent Republican abolitionist. \n\n\u201CWe see this so often in
    the Republic, where young men see no option available for change beyond futile
    attempts at a violent overthrow. Violence is always met with more violence and
    nothing is ever achieved but bloodshed. These people inside the Brothers of Freedom
    need to understand that to project the message that every life is precious and
    worth fighting for, they must first act as if this mantra is true for them also.
    Right now, the public sees only death and mayhem, not a group leading by example.
    Mark my words, if this continues, their message will eventually become so diluted
    that nobody remembers what it is they originally were fighting for.\u201D\n\nVarious
    companies have now begun the arduous process of repairing and restoring the areas
    that were attacked by the would-be revolutionaries, costing the planetary governments
    significantly. The local authorities however, have remained focused on quelling
    the remaining pockets of fighting. However, the fight to bring Melarius Torvil,
    the mastermind of these attacks to justice continues. Various members of the Brothers
    of Freedom leadership continue to remain just as elusive. Commander Jurensai of
    the Caldari Navy issued the following statement:\n\n\u201CWhile local police forces,
    reinforced by Navy troops, have been able to put a stop to the Brothers of Freedom\u2019s
    attacks on several Caldari cities, we are not letting up in our pursuit of these
    criminals, nor has the fighting ended entirely. We will not allow this criminal
    organization to continue its attempts to destabilize our State.\u201D\n\nThe Navy
    has issued warrants for all remaining members of the Brothers of Freedom organization,
    who are believed to have fled the State in secret, leaving only their last known
    locations as a means to ascertain their current location. \n\nFollowing a bout
    of recent losses of manpower and equipment on the side of the Brothers of Freedom,
    many were surprised to see them not only continuing with their struggle, but in
    many cases, with better equipment than they had originally begun with. \n\nWhen
    asked about claims of outside assistance being given to the Brothers of Freedom,
    Commander Jurensai stated simply: \u201CIt is possible, and such an act would
    only help in exposing Torvil as the twisted man that he is.\u201D"
