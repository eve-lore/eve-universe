    \ Commander Aakonoshin Piertalen, head of Sukuuvestaa's Internal Security division,
    revealed that the megacorporation has suffered attacks against several of its
    bases, focused on recently established facilities in the Essence and Verge Vendor
    regions. \"Sukuuvestaa has been the subject of a continuous campaign of aggression,\"
    says Piertalen. Several attacks have even taken place in Caldari high security
    space. \"In response to this aggression, Sukuuvestaa will be greatly expanding
    the budget of its Internal Security division and the Peace and Order Unit,\" said
    Commander Piertalen.\n\nPiertalen calls the instigators of these attacks \"a highly
    organized group of Gallente terrorists seeking to deny the establishment of State
    rule in our new territories.\" Sukuuvestaa is one of the Caldari megacorporations
    that secured the most development rights of Gallente systems occupied by the Caldari
    State Protectorate.\n\n\"We have not seen any increase in terrorist activity,\"
    says a source in the Caldari Navy. \"If there is a terrorist campaign on the rise,
    it is only affecting Sukuuvestaa. The Navy sees no reason to intervene.\""
