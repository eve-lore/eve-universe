    _-_ Dr. Tamo Kinttonen, one of the leading research project managers for the Hyasyoda
    Corporation, has been detained for questioning by Provists at a CBD Sell Division
    station in Kaaputenen.   It is understood that Kintonnen had prepaid for passage
    on an unidentified ship to Penirgman system in the Domain region.\n\nKintonnen
    worked on the [Crielere Project](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Crielere) as
    part of a Hyasyoda team concerned with cloaking technology. Although divorced
    now, he was married at the time to Dr. Sycia Tillbeaux, a Gallente scientist,
    and they appeared in a joint Federation- and State-funded advertisement promoting
    the project's diversity. A former colleague of Kintonnen's commented, \"Tamo told
    me how upset he was about the inquiry [into the Crielere Project]. He felt that
    it was reopening old wounds on both a personal and professional level.  I'm not
    surprised he tried to leave the State before the inquiry reached him.\"\n\nHyasyoda
    Corporation released the following statement about Kintonnen's detainment: \"Dr.
    Kintonnen was on leave when he was abducted by the Provists. There are no restrictions
    on Hyasyoda employees travelling to the Amarr Empire, and we are content that
    Dr. Kintonnen was not in possession of any scientific documents. We object most
    strongly to his incarceration and demand that he is released immediately.\""
