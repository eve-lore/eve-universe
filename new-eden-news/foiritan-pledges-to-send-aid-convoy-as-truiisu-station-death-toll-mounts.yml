    release stating his intention to send an aid convoy to Kassigainen IV to assist
    with what the release terms \u201Ca major \u2013 and growing \u2013 humanitarian
    crisis.\u201D The release states that the convoy is meant as \u201Ca gesture of
    goodwill, and a hopeful step towards better relations with our neighbors.\u201D
    \  \n  \nOnly a few minutes after the announcement, the Caldari State\u2019s Chief
    Executive Panel released a statement indicating the situation is \u201Cunder internal
    review,\u201D and strongly urging the Federation to stay out of Kassigainen until
    proper clearance has been granted. The CEP has since yesterday repeatedly referred
    to the incident as a \u201Cminor revolt by political insurgents,\u201D in what
    many analysts are calling an effort to downplay the humanitarian crisis angle.
    \  \n  \nThe ice planet of Kassigainen IV, site of Kaalakiota mining colony Truiisu
    Station, has since yesterday morning played host to steadily escalating violence
    among its 1700-odd inhabitants. The causes for the fighting are widely disputed,
    and detailed information on transpiring events are hard to come by, though unconfirmed
    reports of atrocities against the worker population have consistently arisen over
    the past 24 hours, including instances of workers being hunted down and murdered
    in front of their families.   \n  \nThe death toll is at this time believed to
    have risen above two hundred and fifty people."
