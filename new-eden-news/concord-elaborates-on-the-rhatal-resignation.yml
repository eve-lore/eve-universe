- body: "A statement, released from CONCORD this morning, has shed some light on the
    resignation of Commander Gispali Rhatal by stating clearly that his resignation
    is in actual fact a medical retirement.   \n  \n\u201CThe use of the word \u2018resignation\u2019
    on the internal note appears to have been a clerical error.\u201D reported the
    statement. \u201CUnfortunately Commander Rhatal\u2019s health has deteriorated
    in recent months and, on the advice of our staff doctors, his retirement was tendered
    on the 4th of this month. This has now been corrected by the regional HR department
    and Commander Rhatal will receive his service medical pension, along with our
    sincerest best wishes for his future.\u201D The statement continued to address
    the issue of the blank service record. \u201CCommander Rhatal\u2019s service record
    is an unfortunate breakdown in record keeping at his former posting and has, apparently,
    not been updated for quite some time.\u201D   \n  \nThe statement mentions further
    that this record is now in the process of being updated, and CONCORD pledges to
    release further details to the public once completed. Surprisingly, the CONCORD
    statement did not address the issue of this information having being leaked from
    within their ranks. Also it does not contain any further details of what regional
    HR department the leak originated from. It can only be speculated that either
    CONCORD do not know of the origin of the leak or that they are seeking to resolve
    this minor breach of security away from the public eye. In light of this minor
    administration hiccup, an invitation has been extended to former Commander Rhatal
    to make a comment on this situation. As of yet he has neither accepted nor declined
    this offer and remains silent."
