- body: "Ibrar Ondagoi, the Governor of Ammatar, yesterday afternoon released a statement
    claiming the Amarr government was \u201Cinformed well in advance\u201D of the
    Ammatar Consulate\u2019s intention of entering into talks with the Minmatar Republic.
    The reason the talks were kept secret, the statement says, is that \u201Cneither
    the Empire nor its mandate wanted to give opportunistic hatemongers a reason to
    incite violence in protest of peaceful communication.\u201D   \n  \nThe Governor
    issued his statement after several meetings with top-level Consulate officials
    over the past week in the San Matarian capital of Auguria. Public response in
    Amarr and Ammatar has been mixed; polling indicates that a large portion of people
    from both the Empire and the Mandate believe the Amarrian government did, in fact,
    have no idea the talks were going on. A number of analysts have theorized that
    in the absence of an Amarrian Emperor, the Mandate is responding to shifting currents
    in the astropolitical spectrum.   \n  \n\u201CWhile we can understand some confusion
    at the news of these talks, there is no need for alarm,\" said Ammatar Consulate
    High Commissioner Anfrid Uptemulf at a press conference yesterday. \"We will not
    be restricted by blind hatred. The Consulate of the Ammatar Mandate will work
    in the best interests of the Ammatar people under, of course, the guidance of
    the Amarr. We will not compromise the ideals upon which the Mandate was founded.
    \  \n  \nWhat fruit the discussions will bear has yet to be decided. At this time
    we remain cautious but hopeful.\u201D"
