- body: "SEYLLIN - Throngs of people at the evacuation points were outraged to hear
    that the prison population of Metal City was being evacuated amidst security fears
    following several escapes reported. The facility was reported to have taken heavy
    damage and already suffered the escape of several high security prisoners.  \n
    \ \nMilitary transport ships aiding the evacuation were recently diverted to the
    scene to secure the prisoners and evacuate them to prevent further escape attempts.
    Word of this has sparked a wave of anger and unrest among those still waiting
    to be lifted from the planet surface. News of the superheated mass heading for
    the planet has contributed to crowd panic, with riots  reported at the evacuation
    points.  \n  \nHowever, early reports from the prison evacuation detail indicate
    that lower-security prisoners have offered to assist with the evacuation effort
    of their fellow inmates, as well as providing additional manpower to dig survivors
    out of the damaged areas of the prison."
