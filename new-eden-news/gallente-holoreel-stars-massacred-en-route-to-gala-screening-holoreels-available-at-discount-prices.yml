- body: "This just in: A convoy carrying Helene Lavergne and Nazarine Ancelmo, famed
    Gallente holoreel actresses, was reportedly intercepted and brutally slaughtered
    in the Amattens system just under an hour ago. Balgor Blint, an escort wingman
    who managed to narrowly effect an escape in his capsule, claims the convoy was
    ambushed by a mixed squadron of interceptors and frigate missile boats which quickly
    decimated its defenses, leaving him the only survivor.  \n  \nAccording to Blint,
    the actresses were heading for the as-yet undisclosed location where the cream
    of Gallente celebrity will be rubbing shoulders tonight: the gala screening of
    Alanor Smitheen\u2019s \u201CUltra!,\u201D described by its hosts as \u201Cthe
    party of the century.\u201D Quizzed over the event\u2019s location Blint denied
    any knowledge, stating that only the convoy escort captain had had knowledge of
    their final destination.   \n  \nThe motivation for the attack is unclear at this
    point. At the time of writing no group has stepped forward to claim responsibility.
    A Quafe source who wishes to remain unknown admitted that Quafe Corp has received
    threats from a mysterious organization named UDI ( United against Decadence and
    Impurity ) , demanding that the holoreel Ultra! is pulled from the market immediately
    and all existing copies of it burned. UDI claims it will \u201Ccleanse those who
    chose to soil young minds with fire and death.\u201D It is not known whether the
    assailants were affiliated with UDI or were acting on their behalf.   \n  \nIn
    response to the attack, a Quafe Corp spokesman was quoted as saying: \u201CQuafe
    corp will never bow to faceless pressure groups or accept censorship in any form.
    Freedom of expression is an important right Gallentean civilians have and we must
    never let anyone take that away from us. There are many injustices in this universe,
    entire nations whose leaders chose to dictate what is wrong and what is right,
    what is immoral and what is not. We as a free people are given the right to choose
    for ourselves, as is our human right. If we surrender to outside forces and allow
    them to limit our expression, our beliefs, then we have not only failed as Gallenteans,
    we have failed as human beings.\u201D He added that holoreels starring Helene
    Lavergne and Nazarine Ancelmo were being sold at 13% discount prices at selected
    outlets, in honor of their memory.   \n  \nHelene Lavergne was 36 years old, best
    known for her work on long-running Gallente soap opera _Time And Time Again_ ,
    as well as leading roles in several feature reels over the years. She is survived
    by her two sons, Robert, 8, and Fizner, 9.   \n  \nNazarine Ancelmo was 31 years
    old, exuberant star of the _Arathea Blake: Merc Girl_ series. A well known actress
    from the adult holoreel industry, Nazarine\u2019s career took a 180 degree turn
    when she starred in \u201CBreaking away\u201D, a melodrama about an estranged
    housewife who\u2019s unhappy relationship with a battleship commander ends with
    tragedy as depression and substance abuse devour her life.   \n  \nShe is survived
    by her husband, actor Dermot Ancelmo."
