    resistance fighters, massed at the Sebiestor Tribe\u2019s headquarters in the
    Eram system to protest the tribe\u2019s highly-debated proposal that the Khumaak,
    a ceremonial weapon carrying significant symbolic value for the Minmatar people,
    be banned. Cargo containers, each containing a Khumaak, were arranged outside
    the station in a pattern forming the word \u201CFREEDOM.\u201D Para-military operative
    Wren, Oracle Corp Chief and one of the rally\u2019s organizers, then delivered
    a speech on the importance of honoring the Minmatars\u2019 history, after which
    the crowd gathered the Khumaaks from the floating containers, took them in hand
    and unanimously claimed a vote of no confidence in the current regime.  \n  \nEarlier
    this afternoon Atbi Enonotur, Chief Coordinator of Public Relations for the Sebiestor,
    issued a statement on behalf of PM Karin Midular, head of the tribe, in response
    to yesterday\u2019s rally. \u201CThe Sebiestor tribe regrets our fellow Minmatars\u2019
    lack of restraint in this matter, and wishes to let it be known that it has not,
    and will not, pander to the wishes of extremists who do not have the Republic\u2019s
    best political interests at hand. Today is a time of diplomacy, and relics of
    a bloody past do nothing to help our relations with the other empires, relations
    which we have built through the hard work of communication and mutual understanding.\u201D
    \  \n  \nBoth the Krusual and Brutor Head Offices have remained quiet on the matter,
    but unofficial sources within the Brutor Head Office claim that Brutor tribal
    heads have, somewhat uncharacteristically, delegated their regular responsibilities
    to subordinates in favor of sitting in closed session. Their meeting has apparently
    lasted in excess of seven hours without a pause, prompting considerable anticipation
    for official comment. More news as it arrives."
