    VI*\n\n### Auviken Cynosural Jammer 'Blip' Prompts Investigation\n\nAuviken, Nagaslaiken
    \u2013 Last evening, an apparent lapse in Auviken\u2019s local cynosural jammer
    network lasting approximately 2.193 seconds prompted a brief high alert in anticipation
    of a potential intrusion into the system. However, once local monitoring stations
    confirmed a total of zero cynosural field activations or jump drive entries during
    or following the \u201Cblip\u201D, the initial alert subsided to an escalated
    response readiness status. In a short public address, Auviken Space Patrol Chief
    Kuutseki Hartenen stated:\n\n\u201CThe security threat posed by a malfunction
    such as this cannot be overstated, and we are investigating every possible avenue
    through which this \u2018blip\u2019 might have come to occur, intentional or not.
    I would like to reiterate that our monitoring stations detected no intrusions
    in the affected period. Furthermore, this incident is inconsistent with the attack
    patterns of established major operations that have threatened State territory.
    Nation incursions, Triglavian invasions, and most recently pirate insurgencies
    centered on Deathless forward operating bases consistently arrive in full force
    without such easily-detectable prior signs as today\u2019s blip. It is therefore
    the opinion of Spacelane Patrol investigators working with State and CONCORD military
    experts that there is no present threat to Auviken.\u201D\n\nWhen questioned about
    ongoing concerns raised by the people of Auviken VI over the possibility of undue
    dangers posed by Upwell\u2019s advanced prototype infrastructure through either
    attracting attackers or\u2014in light of the horrific and avoidable tragedy of
    Turnur I in late YC124\u2014by directly causing some disaster itself, Chief Hartenen
    responded with:\n\n\u201CI would certainly expect any reporter acting in good
    faith to recognize the clear difference between a stellar transmuter and a space
    elevator, and to avoid stoking baseless fears. What\u2019s more, the abundant
    economic benefits and employment opportunities the skyhook prototype has brought
    to the people of Auviken speak for themselves. Spacelane Patrol does acknowledge
    the potential target presented by Upwell Consortium infrastructure in orbit and
    on the surface of Auviken VI. However, I would like to assure the good citizens
    of our sole temperate world that the top-of-the-line suite of planetary defense
    grid upgrades provided by Upwell as part of their construction deal is capable
    of detecting and dealing with any sizable threat from above.\u201D\n\nHe concluded
    his address by stating: \u201CWhile I am not at liberty to disclose technical
    details, we are in the process of identifying the source of yesterday\u2019s thankfully
    uneventful incident and are taking precautions to ensure that no such malfunction
    can happen again.\u201D\n\nThe Scope will continue to report on any further developments
    as they occur."
