    his sincerest sympathies towards the families of victims in the Malkalen disaster
    and offered \u201Cthe full resources of his nation\u201D to assist to those in
    need. He also emphatically denied claims of Federation complicity in the attack,
    stating that Admiral Alexander Noir\u2019s actions were his own and that \u201Cno
    one suspected that he was capable of such a monstrous act\u201D. The delay in
    a formal response was attributed to an \u201Cexhaustive and ongoing investigation\u201D
    into Noir\u2019s actions and a search for any clues that might have provided advanced
    warning of such as attack. \n\nPresident Foiritan spoke cautiously about the post-collision
    battle that resulted in the destruction of the Nyx escorts, stating that \u201Call
    loss of life in Malkalen that tragic day can be attributed directly to the actions
    of Noir alone,\u201D further adding that Ishukone\u2019s account of events in
    the moments leading up to the disaster were accurate. \n\nMeanwhile, the streets
    of Caldari Prime remain eerily quiet since Otro Gariushi\u2019s appeal for calm
    in the days leading up to the Malkalen Economic Summit, and there have been no
    additional reports of violence against Gallente expatriates in Caldari space."
