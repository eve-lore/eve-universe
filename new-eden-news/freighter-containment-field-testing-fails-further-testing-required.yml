- body: "Weekend testing of the cargo containment software has revealed a flaw with
    the system and the upgrade will not be deployed tomorrow. While the software worked
    as intended, the potential release of numerous cargo containers presented navigational
    hazards in simulations where freighters were destroyed. These hazards slowed or
    even stopped movement through systems and caused communications delays as Gal-Net
    became flooded with the sudden appearance of container transponder beacons. CONCORD
    agents were required to individually disable the transponder beacons, a time consuming
    and manpower intensive task. \n\nAnonymous sources are stating this deployment
    is only temporarily halted, but were not able to give a future deployment date.
    Further testing is required to resolve communication issues with Gal-Net and remove
    any navigational hazards."
