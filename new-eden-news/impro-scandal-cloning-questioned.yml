    biotech clone contracts show a shocking increase in the number of capsuleer deaths
    and mind-locks. \n\nRecently released official figures from the Jovian Directorate
    show an increasing number of Impro's clients are experiencing a corruption of
    neural data on transmission to their medical facilities. \n\nCritics on GalNet
    have been quick to point out that Impro are one of the few Jovian companies to
    operate outside faction space and that they manufacture mainly electronic hardware
    (admittedly far superior to those produced by the other empires) and that the
    foray into cloning biotechnology is something of an experiment. \n\nImpro were
    recently in the news when Mikato \u201CDarkElf\u201D Tarawa from [Veto Corporation](http://www.veto-corp.com)
    was left mind-locked due to a neural transfer corruption on route from Lonetrek
    which resulted in a riot outside the medical facilty by fellow Veto pilots. \n\nDoctor
    Yibara from Impro's medical facilty in Goinard explained the case of Tarawa. He
    said: \"The neural data and mindscan transmitted from the previous jumpclone in
    Lonetrek was corrupted. It caused the upload system to crash while it was being
    parsed to his memory.\" \n\n\"The result was what we call a neural jack-in failure,
    which leads to the condition known as a mind-lock,\" added Yibara. \n\nNo explanation
    beyond this was given for the death of Tarawa and Impro have refused to give any
    official comment regarding their cloning technologies. \n\nKeschimiola Murppatoh,
    the chief executive officer of Impro said recently: \"Our mind-lock figures are
    inline with other corporations within the same market sector, I am certain that
    Raurvoras' figures are just like ours.\" \n\nRaurvoras Umokka, the CEO of Zainou
    has declined to comment. \n\nGalNet observers continue to monitor the situation.
