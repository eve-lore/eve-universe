    aged Holder of the Mamet system has decided to release five hundred of the purest
    bred slaves into the care of the CVA. The Ankigher family is renowned in private
    slave-trading circles for their breeding programmes. Mr Ankigher stated:   \n
    \ \n\u201CFor as long as I can remember, Mamet has been a troubled system. As
    close to unsafe space as possible, we have had to deal with crime, poverty and
    the odd outlaw incursion. With the business that the CVA brings us by making use
    of the facilities on one of the orbital station my system (Mamet IV - Moon 6 -
    Zoar and Sons Factory) holds, they have been a great help to our system\u2019s
    economy.   \n  \nIn recognition of their services to the Empire and in particular,
    the Mamet system, I have decided to award them with no less the five hundred slaves
    from my personal stocks. Bred specifically for their pliability, this stock of
    highly indoctrinated Sebiestor slaves are docile enough to function as trustworthy
    personal servants. It took me and my family long arduous decades to breed these
    slaves. I can imagine no greater gift to deliver to the CVA.   \n  \nI will contact
    the CVA representatives privately, to arrange the transport\u201D   \n  \nAlthough
    it is not common that Holders publicly support paramilitary organizations like
    the CVA, the Mamet system, only two jump away from the 0.0 region Providence,
    has been troubled in the past by Sansha incursions, famines and general economic
    failure. It cannot be denied that CVA presence has brought more stability to the
    system."
