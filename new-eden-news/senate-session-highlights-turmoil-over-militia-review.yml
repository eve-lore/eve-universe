    Controversy over the [review into the Federal Defense Union administration](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=3190&tid=5)
    emerged today at an open senate session in Villore, where topics included the
    Defense Committee's review and the Federal Navy liaison office's [parallel investigation](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=3233&tid=5).\n\nVarious
    senators found the Federal Navy involvement in the review 'highly inappropriate'
    branding it as a step towards military oversight of civilian government operations.
    Other political blocs in the senate, including Senator Chermoul himself, argued
    the Navy had equal authority to conduct their own investigations, which they stressed
    were independent of the senate Defense Committee's.\n\nThe Senator stressed that
    the review was nothing like oversight on the Navy's part and they would simply
    compare findings with the senate's committee. He also pointed out that operational
    charters permitted independent investigations by the Federation Navy into such
    matters. \"As far as it goes,\" concluded Seator Chermoul, \"this seems to render
    any protest against their investigation moot.\"\n\nCaptain Jaxon Harner, liaison
    officer to the Senate's Military Oversight department for the Federation Navy,
    was recently reprimanded for his comments about potential Navy authority over
    the militia, and suspended from his position. \"His speculation was outrageous,\"
    said Shevan Marr, pro-CONCORD analyst with The Scope. \"No empire military should
    have that kind of authority over the militias. If this were to happen it would
    push the empires back to the forefront of war; something the emergency militia
    act was intended to avoid.\"\n\nMeanwhile, sources inside the Military Oversight
    department have indicated a split between committee members over unknown factors.
    The committee itself has declined to directly confirm this speculation."
