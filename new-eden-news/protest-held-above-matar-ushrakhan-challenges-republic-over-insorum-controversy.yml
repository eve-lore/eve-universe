    into the usually tranquil orbit of the planet Matar in the Pator solar system.
    The intention of this fleet however, was not one of violence and destruction,
    but that of peaceful protest towards the Minmatar Republic.   \n  \nThe demonstration
    \u2013 organised by the Ushra\u2019Khan, was intended to bring public awareness
    to the apparent inaction of the Republic in providing the Insorum drug for its
    people. Insorum Bisulfate \u2013 created by the late Dr. Ullia Hnolku and his
    wife, is the only known permanent cure for the Vitoc drug, which is widely used
    to control slaves within the Amarr Empire. The U\u2019K holds the only known remaining
    prototype of the drug, and is anxious to see it distributed to the millions of
    Vitoc dependant former slaves within the Minmatar Republic; who rely on smuggled
    and stolen shipments of the Vitoc antidote from within the Amarr Empire.   \n
    \ \nIn a [ ten minute speech ](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=256430&page=1#1)
    broadcast across local communications frequencies, Eddie Gordo of the Ushra\u2019Khan
    addressed the gathered capsuleer pilots.   \n  \nThanking them for their support
    in providing a \u201Cdemanding presence\u201D that \u201Ccannot be ignored by
    the Minmatar Republic\u201D. Gordo went on to attack the Republic for its apparent
    lack of compassion for the thousands of Vitoc addicted freed slaves entering the
    Republic every day. Stating that the Republic \u201Cenjoy the freedom [it has]
    long since taken for granted\u201D accusing them of turning their backs while
    their own people suffer needlessly.   \n  \nDescribing it as a means to \u201Crid
    the Amarr of their vice-like grip of fear over their slave population using Vitoc\u201D,
    Eddie Gordo explained that the Ushra\u2019Khan had previously approached the Minmatar
    Government with the cure and been met with a \u201Cwall of silence\u201D stating
    that the government was ignoring the \u201Csuffering of our people who are less
    than fortunate\u201D.   \n  \nGordo called for the Matari Government to answer
    for what he described as an \u201Cunforgivable treachery against their own kin\u201D,
    stating that the Government had forgotten the \u201Clegacy of the rebellion\u201D
    describing it as an \u201Cact that founded the Republic in the blood and fire
    of our forefathers\u201D. Issuing a plea for the citizens of the Republic to challenge
    their elected leaders and spur them into action, he went on to accuse the Matari
    Government of \u201Cpandering to the Amarr Empire and the pressure of taking sides\u201D
    imploring the government to \u201Cprove these sentiments wrong, and step forward
    to offer their aid in the development of Insorum\u201D.   \n  \nThough the protest
    was largely peaceful, there were continuous attempts to disrupt the proceedings
    across the local communications channels, and several violent altercations took
    place, resulting in the deployment of Concord security forces. Speaking in an
    interview after the demonstration, Eddie Gordo said: \u201CThe speech was delivered
    as planned. It was our intention to have some serious debate, but the ignorant
    comments by certain individuals made this near impossible\u201D. When asked if
    the Ushra\u2019Khan viewed the protest as a success Khaldorn Murino added: \u201CThe
    only judge of that will be the republic\u2019s response\u201D.   \n  \nWhen commenting
    on the effectiveness of the protest, Gordo stated: \u201CI know there are many
    within the republic who sympathise with our cause. It is my hope that this very
    public announcement will prompt them into Action. Something like this is hard
    to ignore\u201D.   \n  \nGraelyn, a member of the Amarrian loyalist Aegis Militia
    observed the demonstration and gave his opinions: \u201CWhat we saw at this protest
    was a terrorist group attempting to push a very separatist platform upon parties
    interested in ending slavery. From what I gathered, the majority of Matari were
    not very receptive of such intentions\u201D.   \n  \nHe went on to add that he,
    like most Amarrians and Matari believe that peace is still possible, stating that
    \u201Can Insorum initiative would only serve to destabilize the great work of
    both Midular and Doriam\u201D, weakening the fragile peace between the two empires
    as a result. Remarking that: \u201CInsorum is not seen as a cure by those who
    witnessed Mabnen I. It is seen as a dangerous weapon.\u201D He explained that
    Republic development of the compound would be seen as a \u201Cdangerous step\u201D
    by the Empire.   \n  \nGraelyn later added: \u201CPeace still has a chance. The
    rumblings of murderous terrorists need not dictate a bloody future for the Minmatar
    Republic\u201D."
