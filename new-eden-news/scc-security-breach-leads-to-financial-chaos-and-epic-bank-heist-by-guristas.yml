    forces and defense systems to these sites. While the additional defenses will
    deter many, the allure of the vast quanities of ISK still remaining in ESS reserve
    banks across New Eden is likely to prove irresistible for hardened criminals and
    capsuleer pirates.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/ess_branch_region.png)

    The Guristas raids on SCC secure key storage and ESS vaults are believed to have
    made off with trillions in ISK, valuable financial data, and security access codes.
    Security analysts are speculating that a series of recent raids by the Guristas
    have been a prelude to this \"grand heist\", allowing them to assemble a picture
    of certain locations, procedures and vital protocols ahead of the massive raids.\n\n
    Just this last weekend a Guristas force raided a number of facilities in Autaris
    system, ostensibly to gain access to Caldari House of Records archives. However,
    in light of the massive multi-location heist of SCC facilities, the House of Records
    infiltration may itself have been misdirection as a number of CONCORD stations
    are located in Autaris.\n\n Financial markets across New Eden are reeling at the
    news of the heists, just as SCC tax and brokerage changes come online. Such is
    the disruption to the systems that a significant quantity of ISK has been routed
    through tax rebate and claims systems, with huge numbers of citizens claiming
    this unexpected and unauthorized largesse. CONCORD and empire law-enforcement
    believe the rebate claims system has itself been hacked and activated en masse
    as a means for the Guristas to steal yet more ISK, with the side effect that it
    is leading to large payouts for all manner of citizens probably viewed as \"a
    joke or useful public image propaganda by the Guristas.\"\n\n In response to questions
    as he left an SCC briefing, Captain Marshal Sirdan xer Qosh, Amarr Delegate to
    the Inner Circle, commented, \"These events only underline the correctness of
    the Imperial Court's view that CONCORD and EDENCOM have both been guilty of dreadful
    mismanagement of the interstellar financial and security systems.\" Ambassador
    Devan Malate of the Gallente Federation added, \"While I often disagree with Captain
    Marshal xer Qosh, it must be said that in this case he has put his finger on the
    essence of the problem: CONCORD's bureaucracy is often as complacent as it is
    arrogant.\"\n\n**In Other News**\n\n* Kimotoro Stock Exchange Suspends Trading
