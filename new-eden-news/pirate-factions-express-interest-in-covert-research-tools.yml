    Cartel), [Blood Raiders](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Blood Raiders), [Guristas](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Guristas),
    [Intaki Syndicate](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Intaki Syndicate), and [Serpentis](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Serpentis)
    have been putting out feelers amongst capsuleers about recovering equipment salvage
    from the so-called "ghost sites" that have been appearing recently. These ghost
    sites, which have been declared off-limits by [CONCORD](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/CONCORD),
    appear to be related to some form of cutting-edge research being conducted by
    various outlaw groups. In addition to retrieving numerous pieces of salvage and
    blueprints for the manufacture of 'Ascendency' implants, many have also taken
    "covert research tools" from the sites. It is apparently these tools which are
    being sought out by the pirate groups. Rumors indicate that the pirates will soon
    be creating buy orders through go-betweens in order to recover them.
