- body: 'LUMINAIRE - The Ishukone Corporation has confirmed that after a sustained
    firefight this morning, a prototype version of the Scorpion-class battleship has
    been stolen from their low-orbit staging point above Caldari Prime.


    Three of the vessels, which were originally designed for use by the Ishukone Watch
    security force, were drafted in for combat readiness assessment during the Caldari
    Prime relief effort. These modified versions of the Scorpion apparently include
    advanced LADAR and thermal imaging equipment, and were intended to be used to
    triangulate remaining Provist troops from orbit, in an effort to airlift them
    from the surface after the declaration of Caldari Prime as a demilitarized zone.


    Landea Vrankef, security consultant for Ishukone Watch, made a statement to the
    interstellar press this afternoon detailing the attack on the temporary shipyard
    where the vessels were being stored. In the prewritten statement she assured the
    media that "a full investigation into how security at our low-orbit staging point
    was breached is ongoing, and we are in the process of setting up an operation
    that will recover the vessel as soon as possible. Thankfully, all three vessels
    were in a state of partial strip-down for maintenance and upgrades during the
    raid, and no prototype sensor hardware was stolen."


    When quizzed regarding the identity of the force that stormed the shipyard, commander
    Vrankref revealed that "This was a highly organized and direct attack. At this
    point in time we believe that the Guristas were behind the theft of the vessel,
    given the fact that it was flown north toward Pure Blind.  However, the investigation
    is still ongoing after pursuing forces lost sight of the vessel in the system
    of Korama."


    Widespread reports would appear to indicate Guristas involvement, after known
    officers Ohminen Sin and Kaikka Peunato were briefly sighted heading north toward
    Lonetrek from the Federal border earlier today, accompanied by an unidentified
    Gallente accomplice.'
