- body: "In the bi-weekly meeting of the CONCORD's Inner Circle, the highest authority
    within the organization, the use of Transcranial Microcontrollers in slaves was
    discussed by the representatives. Officials from the Khanid Kingdom explained
    how the chips were being employed and technicians from the Ishukone Corporation
    explained the science behind them. After a long and heated debate the conclusion
    was not to do anything for the time being. The Federal and Republic representatives
    denounced the chip use as inhumane and cited the story of Sansha's Nation as an
    example of the dangers such technology presented, while the Amarrians attacked
    the critics of slavery, scathingly calling them 'brainwashed puppies of a fraudulent
    governments, imposing their tyrannical will in the guise of human rights.' The
    Caldari echoed the criticism laid out by the Amarrians, urging the Federation
    to stop their intolerable practice of interference in domestic affairs of others
    under the pretext of 'social enlightenment'.  \n  \nThe Caldari furthermore mocked
    the governments of the Federation and the Republic by pointing out that nowhere
    was poverty more of a problem than in these nations, yet they insisted on having
    more socially benevolent systems than others. The decisive vote was cast by the
    Jovian representative, which raised some eyebrows as they usually tend to stay
    neutral in such matters. CONCORD will continue to monitor the situation closely,
    but will not interfere as long as the Dark Amarrians stick to their current usage
    of the chips.."
