- body: "Ardishapur Prime - Yonis Ardishapur yesterday extended his personal thanks
    to the Tash-Murkon naval group which defended a Khanid convoy inside Ardishapur
    space earlier this week. The naval group, which was undergoing training exercises
    in a neighboring system, responded to Khanid distress calls and rescued the convoy
    from as-of-yet unidentified Minmatar attackers.   \n  \n\"The Tash-Murkon forces
    reacted swiftly and decisively to the distress calls. They threw away their regard
    for their own safety in the face of unknown adversaries, willingly risked the
    security of their own patrol routes, and entered into Ardishapur space without
    regard for any possible diplomatic repercussions, all in the name of saving lives.
    For that, they should be commended.\"  \n  \n\"I only wish they had informed the
    Ardishapur security forces in the area of their exercises sooner than they did.
    The presence of unidentified ships in a neighboring system caused our security
    forces to give pause, especially when they entered into our domains. It delayed
    our response time measurably, which could have caused extra harm to the Khanid
    convoy. Luckily, those Tash-Murkon ships arrived almost as soon as the distress
    call was sent out.\"  \n  \nThe investigation into the attacks is still ongoing."
