- body: "SINQ LAISON - The newly reformed Gallente Regional Drugs Squad (GRDS) of
    Federation Customs has already begun operating, executing a drugs raid against
    the Cat's Whiskers nightclub. The operation was lead by \"Inspector Xavier\",
    a Customs Officer with over twenty-five years of experience in anti-narcotics
    law enforcement. The recent upturn in the Federation economy has allowed Federation
    Customs to increase their staff numbers and the scope of their continuing operations
    against illegal booster production. It has come at a time when booster production
    is surging on the frontier, lead by large and organized alliance power blocs such
    as Corelum Syndicate and Hedonistic Imperative. \n\nUpon completion of the successful
    operation, Inspector Xavier was particularly pleased with the outcome; \u201CWe
    have been monitoring the goings-on at the notorious \u2018Cats Whiskers Club\u2019
    for a number of weeks now, slowly gathering evidence until we had enough to ensure
    a conviction...I am pleased to say that we were given plenty of leads, communication
    logs and transaction logs from many good citizens, and this enabled us to piece
    together the jigsaw of what was happening.\u201D \n\nUnder the information released
    by Federation Customs, the owners of the Cat's Whiskers were allegedly being bankrolled
    by two entrepreneurs, Justine Arghalliere and Frances Buterie, of the \"Moonlight
    Productions\" corporation. They paid the two owners of the club to keep quiet
    while they dealt illegal boosters to visiting patrons. These two persons were
    present in the club when it was raided, but fled on first sight of the Customs
    Officers, and a ten million ISK bounty was placed on each of their heads. Justine
    Arghalliere was later [terminated by pilots from Raddick Explorations](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=507544),
    Frances Buterie has gone to ground and is currently missing. \n\nWhen asked about
    the source of the boosters, Inspector Xavier revealed \u201CWe have reason to
    believe that Moonlight Productions was a front for the Serpentis Corporation,
    to allow their agents\u2019 free travel and unhindered access to Federation Space.\u201D
    The Serpentis have recently increased their booster production efforts, and are
    attempting to gain a foothold in the lucrative booster black market within the
    borders of the Gallente Federation. \n\nThe popular owners of the Cat's Whiskers,
    Miss Bressty Chastaine and Mr Paul Giselle were arrested by customs officials.
    They agreed to fully disclose their financial records, as well as their transaction
    and communication logs, allowing them to avoid a custodial sentence. However,
    both are likely to lose their entertainment license, and will be unable to operate
    a business for a number of years. \n\nInspector Xavier then closed the press conference,
    issuing a warning as his closing statement; \u201CLet this stand as a lesson to
    all who think they can flout the Federation's laws on narcotics. The Federation
    Customs will be here, whichever way you turn, no matter how hard you try to hide.
    We\u2019re here to stay, so get used to it. This week I have moved a considerable
    task force into Placid, and I will not rest until that region is drugs-free.\u201D"
