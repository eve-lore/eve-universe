    Sanmatar Joins Geffur Voluval as Republic Celebrates Crisis Victories\n\nClans
    throughout the Republic have resumed Voluval after a surge of Minmatar Crisis
    victories. The reinstatement of these sacred rituals represents a growing confidence
    in the Republic\u2019s ability to deal with the ongoing Drifter Crisis. \n\nMinmatar
    forces were caught off-guard when the Crisis began, and found themselves unprepared
    for Drifter strikes. Since then, the Republic has managed to swiftly reorganize
    and become the most effective anti-Drifter force. Thanks to this ability to pivot
    and capsuleer efforts, the Matari have now claimed victory in 18 systems, the
    most of any nation. \n\nSanmatar Maleatu Shakor joined celebrants on the barren
    world of Geffur V, where a clan of carbon-harvesters held their first Voluval
    since the Drifter Crisis began. Drifter forces have attacked Geffur twice, and
    twice capsuleers have defeated them.\n\n\u201CI am proud to stand with the clans
    of Geffur,\u201D Shakor told those partaking in the Voluval, \u201Cand honored
    to witness the rites performed by these young people today. The perseverance of
    this noble clan is no small thing. You have all shown your resilience time and
    time again. All Matari are with you today, as you are joined with them forever.\u201D\n\n![Tabbetzur

    SOCT Telemetry Gives Rise to Fears Over Tabbetzur\n\nWhile the Minmatar celebrate,
    the Society of Conscious Thought has registered a continuing rise in hyperspace
    traffic around the Republic system of Tabbetzur. The rise coincides with the Minmatar\u2019s
    surge in Crisis victories. Society scientists hypothesis that the shift in activity
    will reach its peak next week, on the 6th of March.\n\nRepublic forces have already
    begun coordinating evacuation efforts in Tabbetzur. Republic Fleet Admiral Kasorata
    Fogneko told reporters, \u201CWe have learned the lessons of the early Crisis,
    and of Turnur. The people of the Republic are our number one priority.\u201D\n\nAs
    the exact nature of the coming threat remains unclear, many Tabbetzur-based clans
    have elected to stay. Brutor Tribal Chief Wkumi Pol has called for the Republic
    to \u201Cforcibly evacuate at-risk individuals\u201D should their clans refuse
    to leave, stating that \u201CSurvival is the first step in the road to victory\u201D.
    Sebiestor Chief Acassa Midular criticized this suggestion, voicing her position
    that \u201Cit is the tribes and their clans, not the Republic, that should decide
    their peoples' fates.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhatever comes on the 6th, fleeing will not
    bring us closer to victory\u201D she continued. \u201CThe Deathless Circle started
    this Crisis with their thoughtless experimentation on Jovian technology. Our only
    path to victory is to claim that power and that knowledge for ourselves. Only
    then will we have what we need to push the Drifters back, and strike at the heart
    of their operations.\u201D\n\n### News in Brief\n\n- IGC denies accusations of
    false reports by SCC auditors.\n\n- Unconfirmed reports of new Deathless Circle
    research near Warden in Zarzakh.\n\n- Caldari State criticised by UCF rebels for
    abandoning low-sec systems to Crisis despite soaring highsec successes.\n\n- SOCT
    refuses to comment on newly surfaced reconstructed visions.\n\n- EDENCOM reportedly
    training in anti-Sleeper Drone tactics.\n\n- Federation forces rally to counter
    every Drifter Crisis but report drop in Crisis frequency.\n\n- Grand Admiral Kezti
    Sundara dismisses Republic wins as Amarr achieve second most Crisis victories
    despite increases in systems impacted.\n\n- Suspected Angel Cartel agents arrested
    Endrulf\_for black market acquisitions of Drifter wrecks.\n\n- Paragon station
    in Ourapheh hosts independent think tank on implications of Drifter technology.\n"
