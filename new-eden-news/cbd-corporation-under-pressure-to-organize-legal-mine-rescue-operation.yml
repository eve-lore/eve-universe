    CBD Corporation is under pressure to organize a legal rescue of trapped miners
    in the Annaro system. Numerous mining and surveying organizations have sent experts
    to analyze the situation, with only Amarr mining corporation Ducia Foundry offering
    a rescue team. However, this team is being refused access to the system because
    of its use of slaves.\n\nSteen Greimala, director of the Ducia Foundry team, commented,
    \"I would like to attempt this rescue because I see it as an opportunity for my
    team to use their skills to aid our Caldari friends. Our slaves, who we call the
    'surface team,' are vital to our work and could not be replaced by simple volunteers
    \"\n\nGarr Diymir of the Annaro police said, \"We've been in contact with the
    Ducia Foundry team leaders, but unfortunately they are not going to be able to
    help without violating Caldari law. Even if we make an exception, the asteroid
    is unstable and I'm told their rescue efforts could cause a further collapse and
    the death of both the miners and the rescuers.\"\n\nCaldari law expert Dimm Margo
    explained, \"Making an exception to the law in this case could set a dangerous
    precedent that would make it acceptable to break the law whenever we feel Caldari
    lives are in danger.\"\n\nThe miners remain in communication with the surface
    and have reported that three more workers have died in the last 24 hours from
    injuries sustained during the accident. The total number of stranded workers is
    now believed to be 176, with estimated air supplies at four days."
