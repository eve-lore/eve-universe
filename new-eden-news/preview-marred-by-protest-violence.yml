    activists opposed to the newest production of controversial 600-year-old play
    'Plantation' at the Minmatar People's Theatre on Pator launched a highly visible
    complaint last night. About an hour before the curtain went up on the preview,
    the protestors appeared at the front entrance. As a result, the performance started
    slightly behind schedule. \n\nThe protest remained peaceful until the curtain
    closed. As the crowd exited the theatre, the protest shifted gears and became
    violent. The minimal police force present was briefly overwhelmed, but quickly
    regained control of the crowd. \"This production is not racist, it's traitorous,\"
    exclaimed one protester as he was arrested. \n\nWentach Mennar, an ex-member of
    parliament for the Representative Party, said \"It was a good show. An important
    show. We have been without a parliament for over a year and it is good that someone
    is asking these questions. People are becoming impatient.\""
