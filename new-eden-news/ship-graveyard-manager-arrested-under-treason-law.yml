    it was revealed that a manager of one of the \u2018Ship Graveyards\u2019 has been
    arrested and charged under Treason laws.\n\nGungoth Hafertte, an employee of Lockdown
    Security Services, was taken into custody by the Federal Intelligence Office as
    part of their investigation into the criminal gangs operating in Federation space.
    It is alleged that during his tenure as manager of a Ship Graveyard, almost twenty-six
    billion ISK worth of equipment belonging to the Federation Navy has gone missing,
    and is now unaccounted for.\n\nHead of Internal Security for the Federation Navy,
    Destaseke Zertavenne, made the following statement at a hastily convened press
    conference in Algogille. \u201CWe have arrested a Vherokior male during our ongoing
    investigation. He was the Security Manager at one of our Ship Graveyards in Placid.
    He has been charged with Treason, after evidence has shown he was selling information
    to criminal gangs associated with the Guristas.\u201D Zertavenne declined to comment
    on what exactly was sold, which would suggest that whatever the information was,
    it was very sensitive indeed.\n\nIt is the first time anyone has been charged
    under the Treason law since a Senator was caught selling deployment schedules
    and force sizes of the Federation Navy to an Amarrian spy several decades ago.
    It is also the first time a person not actually born in the Federation has been
    charged under the Treason laws. Hafertte, originally from Meirakulf, moved to
    the Federation fourteen years ago, and became a full citizen less than five years
    ago.\n\nLockdown Security Services are employed by the Federation Navy to provide
    security in six different locations for decommissioned ships. The Corporation
    secured a multi-billion ISK contract last June, and over seven thousand people,
    mostly Minmatar immigrants, are in their employ. The Corporation is part owned
    by Spacelane Patrol and the Republic Security Services. There have been calls
    in the Senate for the Ship Graveyard security contracts to be reviewed, and maybe
    even brought in-house to prevent this kind of incident happening again."
