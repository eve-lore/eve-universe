    The Black Rise Development Conference was the target of a widespread electromagnetic
    pulse last night, causing a number of casualties and an estimated 1.4 million
    of ISK in damages. No fatalities have been reported, but the pulse caused unshielded
    cybernetic devices to fail, resulting in 23 individuals being sent to intensive
    care units and an additional 213 requiring extensive repairs to implants and prosthetics.\n\nThe
    source of the pulse has been traced to a number of synchronized warheads placed
    around the station, having been smuggled in by unknown means. In light of this
    breach of security, Lai Dai has suffered harsh criticism. \"It's unforgivable
    to put so many people at risk,\" says Genkarhaadan Nineven, part of a group of
    visitors from the Sukuuvestaa Corporation. \"Lai Dai promised us safety but completely
    failed to protect us from this. At least we can be thankful it was nothing even
    more dangerous.\"\n\nThe attack not only caused damage to cybernetic components,
    but also wiped numerous data networks on the station. Reports say that several
    laboratories and assembly arrays belonging to Lai Dai were put out of commission
    in the attack, including a catastrophic Planck bubble failure in one lab that
    was fortunately unmanned at the time of the attack.\n\nIn a statement, the Lai
    Dai Corporation said that service in rented laboratories or manufacturing arrays
    was not disrupted, and that any damages suffered by conference attendees will
    be reimbursed in full by the corporation while an investigation is launched."
