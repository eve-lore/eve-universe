- body: "The highly embarrassing tale of an Amarr Civil Service employee\u2019s drug-fuelled
    rampage has broken on the networks, despite the best efforts of ACS officials
    to keep the matter under wraps. \n\nAzimass Ehkrojour, a long-term employee of
    the Amarr Civil Service, was found to be engaging in \u201Canimalistic, unsavory
    behavior deemed unfitting of the Amarr race\u201D. Following a tip-off from an
    anonymous source, officials discovered him in a Gallente pleasure hub consuming
    vast quantities of alcohol and perusing the local entertainment facilities. It
    is also alleged that he was almost entirely naked as he ridiculed the local clientele
    when asked to lower his voice. \n\nIt is unclear whether he had consumed other
    illicit substances or had any in his possession but the nature and extent of his
    intoxication have convinced others that he was more than simply drunk. \u201CHe
    was in a universe of his own,\u201D stated one local who had been present. \u201CI\u2019ve
    been coming here for years and I\u2019ve seen some strange behavior, but this
    guy got up to some things I\u2019d never seen before\u2026things I could quite
    happily live out the rest of my life without seeing again.\u201D \n\nNow that
    the incident is public knowledge, Azimass' colleagues have been very forthcoming
    with details of the decline of his work ethic and performance over the last year.
    \u201CWe\u2019ve had to carry him for a fair while now,\u201D remarked one co-worker
    who wished to remain anonymous. \u201CHe has a history of being a bit of a party
    animal in his younger days, sometimes it resurfaces. The entire department gets
    nothing done on those days.\u201D \n\nFollowing his outburst, Azimass has been
    made redundant and is currently incarcerated pending an official trial and sentencing.
    Details of the trial and the charges being laid against him are yet to be announced,
    but officials will likely want to make an example of him. \n\nThe Amarr place
    a high premium on self-control and restraint. An incident of this nature is not
    only viewed as a violation of the body but also a violation of the soul and as
    such, an insult to God and the Empire. Despite this, there is a degree of leniency
    within the empire towards certain, more socially acceptable levels of excess.
    As one unnamed ACS source put it however, \u201Cwhen individuals cross the line
    and behave in such a way that it reflects poorly on their organization well\u2026that\u2019s
    an entire other matter.\u201D \n\nThe Theology Council has issued an advisory
    in the wake of the scandal, reminding Amarrian citizens to \u201Cremain vigilant
    against the temptation that has corrupted lesser races,\u201D and encouraged any
    further, similar incidents to be reported to Amarrian authorities, no matter where
    in the cluster they may occur."
