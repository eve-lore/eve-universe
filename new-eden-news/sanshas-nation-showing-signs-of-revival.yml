- body: "STAIN - Following early rumours regarding increased probe activity throughout
    Stain and lower Catch, the once dormant Sansha\u2019s Nation organization has
    apparently begun to rise from its slumber. \n\nRumours have been circulating between
    capsuleer alliances and empire corporations alike in the past two months as several
    pilots reported seeing a build-up in Sansha forces throughout Stain. Recently,
    a CONCORD scouting expedition to the area confirmed that several ships have been
    following old Sansha Industrial shipping routes, indicating a revival in the Nation\u2019s
    industrial infrastructure. It has also been confirmed that Sansha\u2019s Nation
    has begun to fortify its military strength throughout Stain, most likely as a
    reaction to the increase of pirate activity associated with the Angel Cartel.
    \n\nThe Cartel recently sought assistance from local capsuleer alliances as they
    began to expand their area of operations. In response, an entity known only as
    Sansha\u2019s Speaker issued a statement announcing that all expansion efforts
    by the Cartel are \u201Cflawed and will ultimately fail as they are in conflict
    to Nation interests.\u201D The Speaker also warned that all \u201CAngel units
    in Nation territory will be eradicated.\u201D This open threat of war from a normally
    isolated society reinforces the reports of Sansha fleets forming in Stain. \n\nMany
    contend that this recent resurgence is nothing more than old drones following
    defunct programming. This may have been true before the appearance of Sansha\u2019s
    Speaker, but this new diplomatic caste shows that there may indeed be some higher
    intelligence operating deep within Sansha\u2019s Nation. Professor Lerian Tebieau,
    an expert on Sansha\u2019s history agrees, \u201CThe Nation has not dealt openly
    with pod pilots nor Empire corporations in many years. With diplomatic ties now
    being established by the Nation, it can be certain that they will eventually move
    back into their old space and try to reclaim some of their former glory\u2026with
    or without pod-pilot assistance.\u201D \n\nThough there still remains some mystery
    behind Sansha\u2019s Nation, it is clear that its growth will lead it into conflict
    with alliances in the area, including the Angel Cartel."
