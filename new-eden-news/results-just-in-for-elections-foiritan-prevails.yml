- body: "Official results have finally been announced in the Federation elections
    that ended yesterday. President Foiritan's controversial referendum on constitutional
    changes was accepted by the people, despite continuous unofficial polls claiming
    otherwise. A spokesman for the president spoke briefly to the press a few moments
    ago, saying that the president was relieved and very grateful to the citizens
    of the Federation for their support. The spokesman said the president had gone
    on a much needed vacation once the election ended yesterday, after having toured
    the Federation non-stop for two weeks, and could not be reached. Leaders of the
    Senate, who opposed the president's bill, are still to comment on the results.
    \  \n  \nThe election turnout was rather good, with about 30% of registered voters
    casting their vote. Though exact numbers are still to be released it is believed
    that the vote was extremely close, with less than 2% separating those who voted
    yes and those who voted no. More information tomorrow."
