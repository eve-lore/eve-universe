    "Yesterday we confirmed the discovery of a resting place holding the remains of
    holy Saint Anam.  While this would ordinarily be a cause for great celebration
    in our Empire, this Saint''s tomb remains in the Kourmonen system, which is currently
    occupied by the Minmatar Republic."


    "We cannot let these heathens locate and defile this holy resting place: we must
    return the Saint''s remains to a site worthy of his stature.  I command you in
    the name of the Ardishapur Family and all that is Holy and True to go forth and
    reclaim the Kourmonen system"


    "Glory to God and the Empire!"'
