    Oriritsuu) has pledged 40% of her personal wealth to the corporation in order
    to assist in its financial recovery, as well as presented a five-year corporate
    strategy to the board of directors which aims to restore Kaalakiota to the top
    of the [State](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari) financial world.


    KK issued a press release stating Oiritsuu has provided the corporation with a
    no-interest loan with aims to stabilize its financial reserves and allow it to
    be aggressive in reclaiming market share lost under the [Heth](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tibus
    Heth) regime. According to the terms of the loan, Kaalakiota will make yearly
    repayments equivalent to a percentage of their operating profits, and will not
    be responsible for any payments if they operate at a loss.


    The risky and unusual loan has been applauded by financial analysts as a bold
    step toward taking Kaalakiota back toward profitability. "Oiritsuu is basically
    placing a huge bet on her own ability to steer Kaalakiota into the lead again,"
    said Haarbin Aigoro, a financial analyst with the [Mercantile Club](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Mercantile
    Club). "It shows a lot of confidence. Investors will respond to that confidence."


    The KK board of directors has also signed off on Oiritsuu''s five-year plan, which
    was described as "aggressive and bold" in a memo issued to shareholders. "The
    board feels this plan will return Kaalakiota to profitability within a year and
    to its dominant position atop the Caldari financial world within the span of five
    years."


    Kaalakiota stock has seen an uptick since the news was released, continuing a
    trend which began when Oiritsuu was named acting CEO.'
