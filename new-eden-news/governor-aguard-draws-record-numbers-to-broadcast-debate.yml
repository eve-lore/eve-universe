    an event hosted by the Center for Advanced Studies last week, presidential candidate
    Celes Aguard attracted the eyes and ears of nearly 19% of the Gallente Federation's
    estimated daily total audience. In the Everyshore region, the percentage was even
    higher, with almost 35% of the regional audience having followed the show. The
    percentages exceed most other programming within the Federation, where it's rare
    even for the most popular entertainment channels to attract such numbers.\n\nThe
    show, \"CAS Profile of Influence,\" is produced and administrated by students
    of the Center of Advanced Studies, The program has been known to hold interviews
    of many high profile people, from corporate directors and CEOs to famous scientists
    and politicians. The Aguard interview was not the first time a presidential candidate
    appeared on the show, but Aguard's rising popularity in the region, together with
    the show's recent syndication over the Egonics network, contributed to the show's
    success. In addition to having broken the regional viewer record, the show also
    set a new record for audience for a student program.\n\nIn the interview, Aguard
    spoke about her mixed Gallente/Jin-Mei heritage and career in Mies, as well as
    her plans to support fringe economies, as well as her controversial criticism
    of CONCORD. Post-show polls at the CAS show an increase in support for Aguard
    and her policies, placing her behind Jacus Roden, but ahead of Vilard Garioss
    in the race for the presidency."
