    Proclaims Imperial Edict Offering Path to Freedom Through Service\n\nAmarr, Throne
    Worlds \u2013 Empress Catiz I has proclaimed an Imperial Edict offering slaves
    the option to volunteer for special military services, with their Holder\u2019s
    permission. Those who do will be freed after five years of service. The edict
    was also retroactively applied to selected individuals who have already met its
    requirements. \n\nThe edict comes as the Privy Council has enacted a series of
    reforms enhancing the Empire\u2019s war-footing. In particular, the Major Houses,
    as direct vassals of the Empress, have been granted greater latitude over their
    fiefs, but are required to pay an additional war tax and provide more troop levies
    to the Imperial Throne. The Royal Houses have reportedly agreed to extend a similar
    set of privileges to the Minor Houses that are their direct vassals, and will
    augment the Imperial Military Circuits under their control with war levies.\n\nTo
    oversee these measures, Empress Catiz I has appointed Lord Aslan Ul-Qosh as the
    new Imperial Chancellor. Lord Aslan is the head of the powerful House Qosh, Holder
    of the Imperial Planet of Oris, and has recently been administering the Throne
    Worlds on behalf of the Emperor Family. Lord Aslan is a first cousin of Captain
    Marshal Sirdan xer Qosh, head of the Imperial war effort to reclaim the Minmatar
    \u201CRebel Provinces\u201D. \n\n![imperial city dam torsad](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/5AWqYRnGtDn5u9C8oVuteg/469109570a26e73e79da5b3bc2025e55/imperial_city_dam_torsad.png)
    *Above: Imperial City of Dam-Torsad, Amarr Prime*\n\n### Empress Catiz Broadcasts
    Edict to the Greater Amarr Empire\n\nDam-Torsad, Amarr Prime \u2013 The military
    emancipation edict and Privy Council reforms were announced in a live broadcast
    watched by trillions across the Greater Amarr Empire. The broadcast concluded
    with a speech by the Empress from the Imperial Palace in Dam-Torsad setting out
    her vision for the Empire:\n\n\u201CI see a people, driven from their homeland
    for their faith. They adapt, they thrive, and God sees fit to grant them a great
    Emperor. They become stronger, and their Lord grants them a planet, then a star,
    then hundreds more like it. Through the power of their faith and under the guidance
    of their divine leaders they build a mighty Empire. \n\n\u201CI see a people,
    too comfortable in their halls of gold. They have been granted so many gifts that
    they have grown fearful of losing them. They are suspicious of any change, for
    they have so much that they dare not lose. Then when change comes anyway, they
    find their destiny challenged. First by the Jove, sins of the old world brought
    back to life, then by the rebellious children of Matar, then by the evil of the
    Drifters and Triglavian invaders. Their Empire shrinks and they cast their eyes
    upwards and ask, \u2018Why?\u2019 \n\n\u201CI see a people, shining bright among
    the stars. They have faced many trials, but they are bold enough not to be humbled
    by them. They know their faith is too strong to be shaken by any change. They
    have learnt to adapt, to thrive, not outside of their faith but fortified by it.
    Secure in God\u2019s light they renew their faith, return to the foundations of
    scripture, and build an Empire secured by mastery of the very stars entrusted
    to them by their Lord.\n\n\u201CI am your Empress, chosen of God, and in my heart
    I feel His will guiding me. Let me show you the way so that we might be bold once
    more, so that we might thrive. Let us raise the banners of the faithful and proudly
    declare: this is the Empire of Holy Amarr and none may stand against it!\u201D\n\nOn
    hearing these words, crowds massed in public squares and basilicas to hear the
    speech cheered in approbation and pledged themselves to the Empress\u2019s vision
    for Amarr. However, rumours have since surfaced that a number of notable Holders
    expected to attend the announcement in person at Dam-Torsad cancelled their plans
    at the last minute. The Scope approached officials of the Imperial Court for comment
    but received no response.\n\n![imperial stellar const ohide](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/JphFIadsdmM19VASXGa6l/32299e87d36cd475327f66ede1a7dcc5/imperial_stellar_const_ohide.png)
