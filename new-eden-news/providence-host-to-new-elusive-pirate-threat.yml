- body: "Pilots in the providence region are being advised to be extra vigilant when
    travelling, as reports are circulating of a group of as- yet unknown pirates have
    started to prey on lone ships, travelling on the various backwater routes.   \n
    \ \nReliable information about these individuals is scarce; however, they are
    using Minmatar ship designs which have been widely agreed to by pilots who have
    encountered them. The most commonly sighted ships belonging to the frigate class.
    \  \n  \nMore reports are expected, as unfortunate pilots clones are reactivated
    and recovered. From initial questions the cloned pilots appeared very shaken and
    disturbed, telling of lightning raids on their unsuspecting craft.   \n  \nThere
    have been very few survivors from these seemingly random attacks. Many industrial
    and frigate class vessels have succumbed to their firepower, even a number of
    battleships have fallen prey to the unknown aggressors. Those ships that have
    managed to escape the attacks, have often sustained millions of ISK\u2019s worth
    of damage.   \n  \nAlthough reports of other attacks haven\u2019t been overwhelming,
    it is becoming clear that the pirate efforts have mostly been focused on pilots
    in the backwater ends of Providence, with only one or two accounts of being spotted
    straying into the main shipping lanes. Do to the nature of the stricken ships
    and their often \u2018sensitive\u2019 cargo, it is a strong possibility that a
    great many more attacks have been sustained that have simply been left unreported."
