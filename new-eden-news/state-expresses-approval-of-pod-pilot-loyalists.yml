    Kisiras Haakenen avowed the Caldari State\u2019s support for the \u201CCall for
    Unity\u201D initiative.   \n  \nThe initative, an endeavour introduced by Drink
    Starsi\u2122 Relations Coordinator and acting CEO Amin, calls for pod pilot corporations
    loyal to the Caldari State to unite under the flag of an officially CONCORD-sanctioned
    alliance. Haakenen called the move a \u201Cmuch-needed sign that in these trying
    times of ever-shifting allegiance and pan-galactic puppy politics, there are still
    those able to hold to the values that have made our great nation what it is.\u201D
    \  \n  \nHaakenen furthermore urged all loyalist Caldari corporations to get in
    touch with Drink Starsi\u2122, describing the renowned soft drink company as \u201Cone
    of the last true bastions of Caldari spirit.\u201D   \n  \nAccording to a statement
    released by Drink Starsi Security officer Carmen Priano, representatives from
    pod pilot corporations Dead by Dawn, Union Aerospace and the Caldari Independent
    Navy Reserve have already entered into confidential discussions on policy points.
    \  \n  \nDrink Starsi\u2122 are primarily known for their soft drink Starsi\u2122,
    a breakaway hit in the Caldari and Khanid marketplaces since being introduced
    just over a year ago as an alternative to Gallente soft drink giant Quafe\u2019s
    all-pervasive flagship product. Despite persistent rumours to the contrary, Drink
    Starsi\u2122 officials have, throughout the company\u2019s existence, steadfastly
    denied any clandestine involvement with acts of anti-Gallente propaganda and sabotage."
