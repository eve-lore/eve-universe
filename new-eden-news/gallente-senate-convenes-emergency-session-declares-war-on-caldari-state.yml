- body: "Villore - Just moments ago as the Caldari Navy task force entered Luminaire
    in strength, Senate leader Mentas Blaque convened an emergency session of the
    nation's legislative body. Though many members were away from Villore on official
    duties with their various constituencies, there were more than enough Senators
    present to constitute a quorum. \n\nThe only item on the agenda for the emergency
    session was the decision of how to respond to the Caldari incursion into Gallente
    space. In an unprecedented unanimous vote - the fastest in Federation history
    - every Senator present elected to approve the declaration of war. \n\nWith the
    measure approved, president Souro Foiritan has been given emergency administrative
    powers, and is already meeting with his senior military leadership to plan the
    Federation's reaction to the unprovoked invasion of their homeland."
