- body: "Yesterday evening Federal Intelligence Office agents acting under cover of
    disguise are reported to have captured an operative of the UDI somewhere in the
    Sinq Laison region. Federation officials have been unavailable for comment on
    the matter, but a FIO spokesman told reporters earlier today that the investigation
    was \u201Cmaking steady progress,\u201D declining to comment further on the matter.
    \ \n  \nInfrequent skirmishes are reported to have taken place in the Sinq Laison
    region recently between agents of President Foiritan\u2019s specially appointed
    task force and UDI operatives. Since last week\u2019s atrocity theories have abounded
    as to the origin of the mysterious terrorist organization, but as of yet no conclusive
    evidence has been unearthed.   \n  \nPresident Foiritan, it is reported, has been
    sitting in closed session with his advisors over the past few days, preparing
    a public address where he will elaborate on the Federation\u2019s stance towards
    current events. It is unknown at this point just what issues the President will
    touch upon, but analysts agree that the Elarel massacre and the surrounding Quafe
    Ultra debate will play large roles in the allocution.   \n  \nThe atmosphere within
    Gallente halls of government has seen a marked change since the attack in Elarel
    last week. The Senate and the Supreme Court have remained uncharacteristically
    quiet on issues where there traditionally is much contention, and the President
    has, according to one analyst, been able to \u201Cpretty much bulldoze his way
    through whatever obstacles have presented themselves in order to further his own
    ends.\u201D Inside sources have stated that the president \u201Chas been an angry
    man this last week, and it\u2019s showing.\u201D   \n  \nThe President is expected
    to give his address tomorrow afternoon."
