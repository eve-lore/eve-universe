    his company made with the Khanid Kingdom regarding the controversial Transcranial
    Microcontrollers. Ishukone has received considerable flak for selling a product
    it knows will be used on slaves. But Gariushi has dismissed these criticisms as
    pure infantile babble. \u201CLike every corporation, Ishukone has responsibilities
    towards its stockholders to be profitable, that\u2019s the only reason for our
    existence.\u201D Gariushi is quoted as saying. \u201CNo matter what we may feel
    on a personal level, that is the main duty of us that run the company.\u201D He
    continued: \u201CWhat usage our clientele make of our products is none of our
    concern - do armaments manufactures care what their weapons will be used for?
    Of course not. Such scruples have no place in the modern business world and companies
    pursuing them deserve to perish. Besides, in my opinion the chips are a great
    gift for slaves, giving them happiness they would otherwise never experience.\u201D
    \ \n  \nGariushi also talked about the relations Ishukone and the Khanid Kingdom
    have enjoyed in the past. \u201CWe have dealt with the Dark Amarrians for years
    now and regard them as one of our most cherished customers. All our dealings have
    been totally harmonious and there are several cases where they\u2019ve literally
    saved our ass in difficult situations, such as when Crielere was being built.\u201D
    Gariushi was unwilling to expound on what exactly Dark Amarr had done for Ishukone
    in Crielere, only reiterating that Ishukone and Dark Amarr enjoyed a close and
    fruitful relationship that would surely flourish even further in the future."
