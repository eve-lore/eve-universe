    organisation, one of the elite few that represent all the four empires and is
    sworn to keep the law and the peace. But is he also a slave-trading black marketeer
    who arranges the security rating of thugs and pirates? \n\nHongalar Audurleinn
    is his name, and like all of CONCORD's agent's he has gone through the most strenuous
    of background checks before he was hired. Or did he? \n\nMore than one pilot is
    now accusing him of trading slaves \u2013 a practice that is certainly legal in
    Amarr space, but surely frowned upon by all the other empires. Even more serious
    is the accusation that he will \u201Cfix\u201D your security rating for a fee.
    It gets even worse\u2026as a CONCORD agent, Audurleinn can change even the record
    of hardened criminals \u2013 even those ranked low enough to be kill-on-sight
    in all empire controlled space. \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s not illegal. Every law enforcement
    agency since the dawn of man has rewarded criminals who work with the system with
    a reduced sentence.\u201D Audurleinn said today when confronted with these charges.
    \n\nHe refused to comment on the alleged bribes, but various sources claim that
    he has been called back to the main office in Yulai for questioning. To many people,
    this was an eerie reminder of a organisation-wide scourge a few months back, when
    several CONCORD agents were dishonorably discharged from service."
