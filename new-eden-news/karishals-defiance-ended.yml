    Alliance took a new turn on Wednesday, and continues unabated with CVA taking
    control of the station system QR-K85 earlier. \n\nCVA had declared war on Imperial
    Order following a succession of incidents in the former's space that led IO to
    join forces with U'K but this appeared not enough to stem the tide. \n\nThe initial
    target of the CVA and its allies appeared to be more of a strike at morale rather
    than a tactical push, with their initial focus on capturing the outpost home to
    the remains of the deceased leader of The Defiants, Karishal Muritor. The Outpost
    was named \u201CKarishal\u2019s Defiance\u201D as a mark of tribute to the fallen
    leader. \n\nFighting was fierce between the two sides with PIE Inc, Aegis Militia
    and Vigilia Valeria joining CVA on their offensive. U\u2019K started to lose ground
    despite the help of the Imperial Order, Electus Matari, Fimbulwinter, Chaos Incarnate
    and The Star Fraction in defending the system. \n\nAccording to observers, U\u2019K
    had been asking for help from numerous entities and received assistance from a
    variety of forces including EM, CI, Namtz'aar K'in, the Littlest Hobos, IO and
    numerous independents including Mori Felding as well as SF. \n\nEven with this
    aid, the battles continued and U\u2019K seemed incapable of stemming the flood
    of CVA and its allies, with some losses considered to have been avoidable and
    blamed on the inexperience of young fleet commanders. \n\nDespite accusations
    from both sides of the conflict that U\u2019K were not as committed to defending
    their space as they should be this does not tell the whole story. The Herculean
    efforts of EveJoker did not go unnoticed by combatants and one of the few times
    that he took a break from proceedings led to erroneous reports that SF were in
    control of the defences. He was ably assisted in the fight by Aequitas Harbinger
    of IO and Algey of the Littlest Hobos but their tactical nous was not enough to
    beat back the advancing horde. \n\nNews just in indicates that the QR-K85 Outpost
    \u201CKarishal\u2019s Defiance\u201D was captured and renamed to \u201CKarishal\u2019s
    Folly\u201D, by Amarrian paramilitary forces earlier on Wednesday. This could
    lead to a huge upswing in the conflict with Amarr forces attacking what they percieve
    to be terrorists, whilst at the same time looking to protect their commercial
    interests. Regardless, Ushra'Khan desperately need to defend their nearby systems
    which are now under threat. \n\nAs a result of recent developments, \"The Voices
    of Matar' held a protest rally against the current government of the Republic.
    The rally, which took place in Lustrivek V \u2013 Republic Justice Department
    Law School, threatened to spill over into violence.  \nA report on the rally is
    forthcoming."
