    and [suspension of Federal elections](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/federal-elections-suspended-after-presidential-candidates-attacked-and-federal-networks-collapse/),
    President Jacus Roden has addressed the Gallente Federation, vowing to secure
    democracy and bring to justice the perpetrators. President Roden made his address
    as Federal communications networks stabilized, although some planetary networks
    continue to operate under heavy limitations.\n\nPresident Roden's address outlined
    the events, his administration's immediate reponse, and what future efforts will
    be made to resolve the crisis.\n\n\"My fellow citizens of the great democratic
    Gallente Federation. We have been attacked. We have all been attacked in the most
    infamous act of villainy since the betrayal of the traitor Anvent Eturrer. Grave
    as his treachery was, it is eclipsed by an attack not simply on the Federation
    but, crucially, on the foundational principles of this great democracy. Let me
    be clear. Like the traitor Eturrer, those who perpetrated these vile attacks on
    our way of life shall be brought to justice swiftly and surely.\n\n\"Allow me
    first, my fellow citizens, to mourn with you for those we have lost, for those
    injured so gravely, and for all victims and families affected by these outrages.
    It is my sad duty to report that the confirmed death toll from these evil attacks
    stands at over 7,000. Tragically it is likely to be even higher in the final accounting.
    Many tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, have suffered injury.\n\n\"The
    physical attacks on presidential candidates, Federal installations and civilian
    infrastructure account for the greater number of the immediate casualties. Sadly,
    such was the scope and effect of the parallel network attacks, it is sure very
    many will have been injured consequently, and many more will lose their lives.
    We will mourn in full, as a democracy and a Federation, in due time.\n\n\"Now,
    I wish to update you all on the status of those of our leading democratic presidential
    candidates who were attacked in the course of last night's events. I am glad to
    report and confirm that Governor Celes Aguard is alive and recovering in a secure
    facility. Though she suffered physical death in the bombing at New Riennes, along
    with so many others, her federally-registered personality backup and clone was
    successfully restored. The assassins failed here, even as they brutally murdered
    thousands.\n\n\"I can also report that Senator Suvio Bellaron is alive and in
    stable condition, following transfer by Federal Marines to a secure medical facility
    in the Intaki system. We hope and trust that he will fully recover. Mayor Shaileen
    Ramnev's condition remains grave though I am told it has stabilized. I have directed
    Federal Marines to secure the hospital in Arcurio and their Medical Corps to render
    all necessary assistance.\"\n\n\"Councillor Wayaki Kayara was slightly injured
    in a terrorist attempt made on his life, while he visited military veterans on
    Mannar Seginde. I am told those brave men and women, who have already given so
    much to our Federation, unhesitatingly fought to protect him. One veteran has
    been hospitalized but Councillor Kayara is expected to make a full recovery. It
    would appear that there was no direct attempt made on the lives of Senator Kelen
    Ontbad, Chief Director Mentas Blaque or General Julianus Soter, though our initial
    intelligence assessment is that they were all targets.\n\n\"If these violent acts
    of terror and attempted assassinations of presidential candidates were not evidence
    enough of a monstrous plot to strike deep at the heart of our democracy, which
    plainly they are, then the attacks on our Federal and planetary communications
    more than confirm the base intent of these attacks. With deep regret we agree
    with the Federal Elections Commission's decision to suspend elections until further
    notice. We are resolved that this suspension shall be short and that the necessary,
    vital democratic process will work the people's will as soon as possible.\n\n\"The
    Federal Administration, working with all federal agencies, CONCORD agencies, and
    trusted commercial partners, has restored the core functionality of the Federal
    FTL communications infrastructure. Even so, much data has been lost and many planetary
    networks remain unstable or are providing limited service.\n\n\"My administration
    is working tirelessly to restore full communications function at every level of
    the Federation: regionally, system-wide and on every planet and orbital. I can
    report that the Federal and civilian FTL connections to Solitude region have been
    restored after a mercifully brief period of disconnection. Military and security
    force networks retained basic connectivity. The Federation is grateful to CONCORD
    for making available SCC and DED bandwidth for Federation government traffic.\n\n\"I
    am also grateful for the measured and generous response to this tragedy, not only
    from CONCORD, but from our interstellar neighbors: the Minmatar Republic, Caldari
    State and Amarr Empire. All have assisted in some measure and a greater tragedy
    may well have been avoided by caution and forebearance. I must express my particular
    deep gratitude to Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor and the Tribal Council of the Minmatar
    Republic for their unstinting and valuable support during this crisis. Our alliance,
    founded on our common belief in the liberty of human beings, remains strong.\n\n\"Let
    me now turn to the future. I wish to reassure you all, simply as a fellow citizen
    of the Gallente Federation, but yes as the President of our great democracy that
    the continuity of democratic government is my number one priority. Meeting that
    priority requires the re-establishment and reinforcement of the security of the
    Federation and its citizens. It requires that democratic elections be held securely
    and in full freedom. It requires the peaceful transfer of power to the next duly-elected
    President of the Gallente Federation.\n\n\"I pledge to meet the priority I have
    laid out in full. My fellow citizens, amidst this scene of tragedy and villainy,
    take heart. The Federation will endure. The Federation is Liberty; and Liberty
    can never die.\"\n\nPresident Roden's administration has estimated that close
    to full service on interstellar and system-wide FTL comms networks will be restored
    over the weekend. Planetary networks and other infrastructure may take more time
    to restore. It is projected that essential services will be restored early next
    week in most locations. The Federation Navy and Federal Marines remain on high
    alert.\n\n**In Other News**\n\n  * Federal Stock Exchange in Luminaire Remains
