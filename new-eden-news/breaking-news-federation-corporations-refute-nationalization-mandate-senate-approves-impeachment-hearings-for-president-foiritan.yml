    Following the defiant example of Roden Shipyards, Federation arms manufacturers
    have collectively refuted President Foiritan's nationalization mandate. A hastily
    arranged charter has been signed by twelve of the largest Gallentean corporations
    and delivered to the Presidential Office in Ladistier. According to sources, the
    charter states their explicit refusal to comply with the Hueromont Act and boldly
    demands that government troops leave corporate properties \"with immediate effect.\"\n\nIn
    what many see as a surprising move, Federal Intelligence Office (FIO) Director
    Mentas Blaque has ordered federal agents to \"belay prior enforcement directives
    and stand down.\" It is unknown if his actions represent direct insubordination,
    or if the order was issued by the president. The FIO refuses to comment.\n\nIn
    what many are calling the death throes of the Foiritan presidency, the Federation
    Senate voted by a two-to-one margin to begin impeachment hearings as early as
    next week. This is the latest in a series of national misfortunes for the beleaguered
    president, whose popularity since the outset of the Empyrean War has plummeted.\n\nWhile
    confrontations between government and corporations have yet to turn violent, reports
    of civil unrest are trickling in from throughout the Gallente Federation. Populist
    groups are largely divided between the president's actions and the hawkish measures
    needed to rescue frontier Federation settlements from Caldari occupation. Libertarian
    groups decry the president's actions as a \"totalitarian\" attempt to take sovereign
    rights away from corporations, but have traditionally sided against pro-business
    causes.\n\nAs of now, the president has not officially responded to the corporation
    charter or the senate impeachment hearings.\n\nThis is a SCOPE breaking news story.
    More coverage will follow as details emerge."
