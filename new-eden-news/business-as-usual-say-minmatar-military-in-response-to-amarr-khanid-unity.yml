    figures within the Minmatar military establishment have dismissed recent developments
    in Amarr-Khanid relations as \"changing very little\" as far as the security of
    the Minmatar Republic is concerned. While a number of conciliatory moves have
    been made in recent months, the formal declaration of unity between the Amarr
    Empire and the Khanid Kingdom took New Eden's diplomatic community largely by
    surprise. In particular, Empress Jamyl I's decision to give Khanid II a seat in
    her Privy Council was unexpected and enhances her reputation for bold statecraft.\n\nWhile
    he too admitted surprise at the nature of the move, Chief Scout Vir Honn of the
    Republic Fleet's Surveillance division nevertheless suggested that, beyond the
    technical details, it amounted to \"business as usual.\" \"When you analyze the
    last few years, the Amarr and Khanid have been co-operating quite closely on strategic
    objectives,\" said Honn. \"For instance, the Audesder-Kenobanala border situation
    involved Khanid Kingdom forces from the very outset.\"\n\nRemaining anonymous
    for security reasons, a senior officer in the Republic Security Services agreed
    with Honn. \"In any conflict between the Minmatar people and Amarr, the Khanid
    interest lies in aiding the Amarr Empire,\" said the officer. \"Even when relations
    between Amarr and Khanid were considered frosty, they worked together against
    us constantly.\"\n\nBy contrast, Krusual parliamentarian Tobias Efrit expressed
    some misgivings. \"We should not fool ourselves into thinking this is an insignificant
    event,\" he warned. \"I hear Vir Honn talking about the Audesder-Kenobanala stand-off
    and I am sure he hasn't forgotten the Khanid brought the Caldari with them.\"
    Efrit suggested that more attention should be paid to the potential for Amarr-Khanid
    developments to \"permanently lock the Caldari in the Amarr camp.\""
