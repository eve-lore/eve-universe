    and Ammatar space with a mission. That mission was to strike at the very corporations
    at the heart of the Amarr empire and free as many slaves as they could find. From
    reports from the various cells of resistance fighters, the mission was declared
    a success. Minmatar officials have reported that over 11 thousand slaves were
    set free and taken into immediate care after only a few hours of intense skirmishes.
    \  \n  \nThe slaves that were taken from the slaver convoys were taken to the
    truth and reconciliation council facilities where they received immediate food,
    water and counselling. Officials claim that they have enough of the Vitoc antidote
    to go around all of the freed slaves for the immediate future. But they are already
    seeking more.   \n  \nKhaldorn Murino, and other Minmatar pilots who were organising
    the strikes were surprised by the willingness and numbers of the pilots who turned
    up to this well publicised attack. The organisers were often overwhelmed by the
    number of pilots who needed assigning to the various \u201Ccells\u201D.   \n  \nThe
    Matari pilots use the tactic of striking the Amarr slaver convoys with cells of
    a few pilots each. This seemed to work excellently. They managed to fly, almost
    unhindered, around Amarr space as there were just too many targets for the Imperialist
    Amarr corporations to go after.   \n  \nThe fact that this incursion was well
    publicised was also a spot of bad news for the Minmatar. Amarr Imperialist forces
    amassed a mighty fleet, consisting of almost fifty battleships, cruisers and interceptors.
    They took up positions at the Lustrevik gate in Pator, which is the first step
    of the most direct route from Pator to Amarr. But because the Matari and supporters
    were working in smaller, more agile cells, many of which started the operation
    inside of Amarr space, the blockade was largely ineffective. Although they did
    stop pilots from corporations who they were at war with taking a direct route
    to their space, forcing them to take long diversions. Any pilots in Concord sanctioned
    warfare with the blockade pilots were swiftly dispatched when encountered.   \n
    \ \nThe cells strategy employed, although effective, was learned the hard way.
    The consensus from the Minmatar was that they could not compete with the Imperialists
    for firepower, so they would out-manoeuvre them with their speed and numbers,
    tactics which have served them well in the past.   \n  \nImperialist Amarr spokespeople
    have expressed outrage at the actions of the Matari pilots, calling them \u201Ccowards\u201D
    and \u201Cterrorists\u201D for their \u201Csenseless acts of aggression in Amarr
    space\u201D. Their main outcry was that the Matari only attacked innocent, defenceless
    convoys in the safety of high security space, where they could not be confronted
    by the Amarr forces for risk of rousing a hostile concord response.   \n  \nThe
    cell leaders retorted, saying that people who trade slaves are never innocent
    and the pilots were given ample warning to turn over the slaves before any attack
    was made towards their vessels.   \n  \nImperialists have warned the Matar that
    continued hostile actions will only lead to more suffering on the Minmatar\u2019s
    part, hinting towards being ordered to \u201Creclaim\u201D Republic space for
    the Empire.   \n  \nAlthough it is too early to speculate, the pilots involved
    expressed their desire to get their political message across to all of the governments
    in EVE. They want the trade in slaves to be made illegal galaxy wide, especially
    in their own territory, where they feel betrayed by their government. But they
    also hope to gather support from the Caldari and Gallente. Accusations were made
    of the Gallente senate \u201Csitting on the fence\u201D over slave issues, claiming
    that with their full overt support they could finally find a permanent cure for
    the Vitoc situation, instead of the handful of scientists currently working to
    find a solution.   \n  \nClaims have already been made by more vocal Minmatar
    factions that unless the slave trade is abandoned, more incidents of this type
    could follow. And next time, the Amarr may be able to adapt more to Matari tactics.
    \  \n  \n  \n  \nDue to unforeseen circumstances, this article has been posted
    too late. My sincere apologies to the people involved in the article and Emilianne
