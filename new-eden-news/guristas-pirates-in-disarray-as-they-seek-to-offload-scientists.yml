- body: "The Guristas, yet again grabbing the headlines the world over after their
    latest exploits in the Crielere system, are reported to be in an uproar following
    the loss of their leader, commonly known as Fatal. It is believed that the cocky
    Fatal only possessed an inferior clone of himself and is now suffering from severe
    loss of memory and motor functions. His partner in crime, known as the Rabbit,
    is not happy with the state of his former compatriot, nor his conduct during the
    raid on the Crielere complex. Fatal has gone into hiding and his future role with
    the Guristas, the cartel he helped create, remains uncertain. Yet some have speculated
    that the rift between the Fatal and the Rabbit is only a ploy the pair is playing
    to confuse their enemies, with Fatal only taking his time to recover and, perhaps,
    seek revenge on those that \u2018podded\u2019 him. Fatal was killed after a multi-system
    chase that ended in Second Wave Inc.'s Security Chief Doc Brown cracking his escape
    pod.  \n  \nIn the meantime, the fate of the famed scientists the Guristas kidnapped
    from the Crielere station is still to be decided. The intelligence community is
    reporting that the Guristas are currently seeking a buyer in secret, someone willing
    to pay the vast sum the crime cartel is demanding for their prized assets. Negotiations
    are currently underway with several unidentified parties, with the ransom believed
    to be in the region of several trillion isk."
