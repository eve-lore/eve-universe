    At a press conference outside his home, retired Federation Navy Rear Admiral Daren
    Fasio announced his entry into the upcoming Gallente presidential election. The
    61 year old retiree, an ethnic Mannar and an unabashed hawk, was openly critical
    of the previous administration's conduct in the ongoing militia war with the Caldari.
    \"By failing to fully and immediately mobilize the substantial economic and industrial
    power of this great Federation, President Foiritan has led our nation into a fool's
    war.\" Fasio elaborated, stating that \"It's not that we can't beat the Caldari,
    it's that we refuse to try to our fullest potential. \"\n\nFasio was equally critical
    of several of the other candidates, particularly Senator Vilard Garioss, whose
    pro-reconciliation agenda Fasio labeled a \"platform of surrender.\" Fasio also
    criticized industrialist candidate Jacus Roden for refusing to comply with President
    Foiritan's invocation of the Heuromont Act. \"If Roden cared less about his quarterly
    profits and more about the good of the nation, he'd have been eager to comply
    with the act. How can we ask our ordinary citizens to make sacrifices for the
    good of the Federation if our prominent leaders will not?\"\n\nIf elected, Mr.
    Fasio has pledged to take a number of steps designed to put the Gallente Federation
    in a more aggressive stance. His plans include a renewal of the invocation of
    the Heuromont Act, the institution of a national draft, increased conversion of
    civilian manufacturing to military production, and a program of civilian rationing
    for critical war materiel. \"War is hard, and if we mean to fight it, we should
    all be doing our part. It's not too late to reverse the course, but if we continue
    to fight with one hand tied behind our backs, we will surely suffer further defeats.\""
