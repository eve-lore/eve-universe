    BREAKING: Turnur Devastated by Extreme Stellar Event\n\nTurnur, Metropolis \u2013
    An extreme stellar event has devastated the disputed system of Turnur as a radiation
    burst and wave of supercharged plasma exploded from the star in the culmination
    of several days of increasing stellar instability.\n\nIt has been confirmed that
    destructive radiation and plasma has scorched the inner planet of Turnur I, leaving
    the world a charred ember with its atmosphere stripped away by the passage of
    the blastwave. Fears are mounting that there can be no survivors on the planet,
    raising the spectre of hundreds of thousands, to perhaps millions of casualties.
    Estimates of the death toll are impossible to make given the uncertainty over
    the size of the nomadic population that chose to remain on the doomed world.\n\nThe
    Republic Parliament Bureau station in orbit of Turnur I has barely weathered the
    storm of radiation and plasma, with its shields apparently buckling in places
    and widespread damage to the peripheral sectors of the station. Casualties are
    being reported but it is understood many have survived in the shielded deep core
    of the station.\n\nA number of capsuleer structures recently anchored very close
    to the star, despite the indications of such an event and warnings of disaster,
    were destroyed by the combined effects of the radiation burst and plasma particle
    wave. Overloaded shielding and subsidiary defenses appear to have been incapable
    of withstanding the impact of so much radiated and kinetic energy, resulting in
    cascading failures and total destruction.\n\nCapsuleer vessels appear to have
    fared little better with shields and armor systems being stripped and disrupted,
    before ship structures were heavily damaged by the radiation burst's effects.
    Reports of heavy fighting in the Amarr-Minmatar warzone system, and around structures
    as the radiation burst hit are unconfirmed as yet.\n\nThe Imperial Navy and Republic
    Fleet have raised their alert status to the highest levels short of outright wartime.
    Diplomats and CONCORD officials are understood to be urgently establishing multilateral
    lines of communication in an effort to avoid the situation tipping over into a
    wider interstellar conflict beyond the militia warzone.\n"
