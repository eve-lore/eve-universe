- body: "Tennen \u2013 Hyasyoda Corporation announced yesterday that its scientists
    had successfully engineered an antiviral agent to counteract the Tennen Blight
    and predicted a swift end to the quarantine that has locked down Tennen VI for
    nearly a month. Unfortunately, despite the swift action of Hyasyoda crop scientists,
    it appears that the planet's harvest for this growing period is nearly a complete
    loss, a shortfall that is having wide repercussions throughout the Caldari Border
    Zone. \n\nSpeaking at a news conference held at the Hyasyoda refinery station
    in Tennen, Dr. Eitar Hayona, leader of the School of Applied Knowledge team on
    Tennen VI, told reporters that the blight has been \u201Ccompletely contained\u201D
    and that further outbreaks of the disease were extremely unlikely. \u201CUsing
    the agent we've developed, both strains of the virus can be eliminated from within
    a plant in a matter of days after application. Mass manufacture of the antiviral
    agent has already begun and we believe it will be ready to be spread aerially
    to all the fields of Tennen VI in less than a week. Hyasyoda scientists have already
    used our findings to begin engineering new hybrids for use during the next growing
    season which will be resistant to the blight.\u201D \n\n\u201CUnfortunately,\u201D
    continued Dr. Hayona, \u201Cthe current crops have been badly damaged by the disease
    already, and we believe that little, if any, of the infected crops will be able
    to produce their expected yields this season. While Captain Tarpas has asked me
    not to give you any exact figures at this time, I can say that overall yields
    from Tennen VI this season are expected to be in the 20-30% of predicted numbers.
    The final numbers will really only be available once we see how effective the
    antiviral treatment is.\u201D \n\nDespite the development of the antiviral agent,
    a statement from the Caldari Business Tribunal has announced that the quarantine
    will remain in place for at least two more weeks to ensure that the disease has
    been eradicated from the surface of the planet. With the end in sight, however,
    fears of food shortages and rising prices have subsided somewhat. Lines outside
    the largest groceries in Muurskiota were far shorter today, and prices had already
    declined 5% overnight and were continuing to decline throughout the day. \n\nMeanwhile,
    Hyasyoda corporate headquarters released a statement thanking Dr. Hayona and her
    team for their \u201Ctireless efforts to save the livelihoods of the hard-working
    citizens of Tennen VI,\u201D and congratulated both the SAK team and the Hyasyoda
    scientists involved in the relief effort on their success. In a surprising move,
    however, the statement also said that the Corporate Police Force had determined
    that there was \u201Cinsufficient evidence to prove foul play in this matter\u201D
    and that as a result, \u201Cthe Hyasyoda Corporation has no plans to file suit
    with the Tribunal at this time.\u201D However, there has been no sign that the
    CPF detachment in Tennen is leaving, and the investigation into the incident appears
    to be ongoing. \n\nInsiders within the Suroken headquarters of Hyasyoda say that
    while the CPF hasn't been able to find concrete proof, many of the corporation's
    leaders are positive that Sukuuvestaa subsidiary Sunny Side Farms was involved
    in the introduction of the blight. \u201CJust look at what's happened to them
    in the last two weeks on the market,\u201D said one CPF investigator who refused
    to give his name. \u201CThey've shot up almost 12%, all because they're filling
    the contracts Tennen VI can't make. If there's anyone with a good motive, it's
    them.\u201D \n\nWhen confronted with these accusations, Sunny Side Farms spokeswoman
    Kirsten Morita said that the claims were \u201Csimply preposterous.\u201D \u201CTennen
    VI has been a horrible tragedy, and our company feels deeply for those workers
    who were affected. However, nothing justifies these completely spurious accusations
    and we encourage the media to take them with a grain of salt. If there was any
    real proof of foul play in this incident, I'm sure that Hyasyoda would be asking
    for a Tribunal investigation to get to the bottom of it. As no investigation seems
    to be forthcoming, repeating such statements is completely irresponsible.\u201D"
