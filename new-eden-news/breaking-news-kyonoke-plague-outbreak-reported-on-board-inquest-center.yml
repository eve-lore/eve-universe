- body: 'POSTOUVIN - The Scope Galactic News Network has learned that SoCT security
    and medical personnel are currently battling to control a significant outbreak
    of the Kyonoke plague on board the Inquest Center Keepstar.


    Initial reports suggest that the entire structure has been placed under security
    lockdown, with a complete quarantine cordon in place that has shut down docking
    bays, external traffic control and the vast majority of the facility''s external
    communications services.


    While The Scope has not been able to verify reports at this stage, it is believed
    that the outbreak was caused by contaminated materials that were exposed to the
    facility''s atmosphere during yesterday''s ransacking of two of the main on-board
    virology laboratories.


    Several eyewitness reports from on board the structure have confirmed that emergency
    strobes and signalling systems have been activated on a number of the structure''s
    decks. There have also been reports that a number of laboratories, storage areas
    and maintenance sectors have been completely sealed off as security and medical
    teams fight to control the spread.


    The Scope Galactic News Network will continue to monitor the situation, and report
    on further developments.'
