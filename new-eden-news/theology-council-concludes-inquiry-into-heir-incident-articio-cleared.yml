- body: "The Amarr Theology Council made an inquiry into the \u2018incident\u2019
    involving the royal heir Articio Kor-Azor at the request of the church authorities
    where the \u2018incident\u2019 took place. The Council has now concluded the inquiry
    and reported its findings. Surprisingly little is said in the report and it seems
    the Council was unable to delve deep into the secrecy shrouding the infamous \u2018incident\u2019.
    \  \n  \nVarious witnesses seem to have disappeared into thin air or are suffering
    from a sudden stroke of amnesia, but are rumored having received lucrative promotions
    or large sums of money. The centerpiece of the inquiry, a Gallentean exchange
    student, has since disappeared making investigators unable to question her. Though
    the report strongly suggests that an elaborate cover-up has taken place, the investigators
    were unable to uncover the truth in the matter. Perhaps one day someone will come
    forward with the whole sordid story, but until then Articio Kor-Azor can continue
    living his extravagant lifestyle as before, free of worries."
