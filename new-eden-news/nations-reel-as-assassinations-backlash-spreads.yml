- body: "Chaos is spreading around EVE as the consequence of Doriam\u2019s II assassination.
    The Amarr Emperor was slain last night in the Imperial Palace in Dam Torsad by
    an unknown assailant. The Imperial Chancellery is heading the investigation, with
    aid from the Ministry of Internal Order. Amarr police has rounded up a few suspects,
    believed to be foreigners, and is currently questioning them at an unknown location.
    \  \n  \nAt the daily morning meeting of the Chief Executive Panel, the leaders
    of the Caldari State were unanimous in condemning this \u2018appalling atrocity
    and attack on the political harmony of the world.\u2019 They also appreciated
    the need for the harsh response of the Empire in shutting down several border
    zones and stated they would do the same to keep radicals from exploiting the situation
    to their advantage.   \n  \nThe Privy Council also held a session this morning,
    but what transpired there is still a mystery. Sin Callor of the Ministry of Internal
    Order and a member of the Council let is slip though that \u2018Doriam\u2019s
    death will drive many shadowy elements to the surface.\u2019 We hope future events
    will cast light on those elusive words."
