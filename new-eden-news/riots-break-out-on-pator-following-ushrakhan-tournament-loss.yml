- body: "Pator - Shortly after the Ushra'Khan alliance was officially eliminated from
    the 5th Alliance tournament following their loss at the hands of eXceed., riots
    broke out across several cities on Pator. \n\nThe Ushra'Khan tournament team was
    not one of the favorites to win the entire tournament according to odds makers,
    though they had vast popularity in the Minmatar Republic. As the only alliance
    in the tournament to openly support the Matari people and their way of life, many
    fans in the Republic had deeply invested themselves in the success of the team.\n\nTheir
    loss sparked violent incidents across the Republic, with at least one million
    various fights being reported to police, and possibly more that went unreported.
    However, only five incidents - all on Pator - erupted into full-blown riots. \n\nThe
    riots left over one-thousand injured, seven reported dead, and caused millions
    of ISK worth of property damage. Police do not believe the riots were part of
    any planned demonstration of violence. \"All evidence points to these riots being
    a spontaneous outpouring of emotion following an unfavorable outcome in a sporting
    event,\" said Captain Minas Kant, the lead investigator in the case.\n\nSo far,
    thirteen have been charged with inciting riots, with an undisclosed number of
    people arrested for disorderly conduct. Police expect more arrests to occur as
    security tapes continue to be reviewed."
