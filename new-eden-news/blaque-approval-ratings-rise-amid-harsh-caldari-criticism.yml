- body: "Press representatives from the Caldari State\u2019s Chief Executive Panel
    yesterday released a statement on incendiary speeches held in the past month by
    Gallente presidential hopeful Mentas Blaque, in particular the candidate's May
    16 speech at the Gallente Prime city of Hueromont.   \n  \nThe Panel leveled harsh
    criticism at the senator\u2019s speech, calling it, among other things, \u201Ca
    disingenuous display of nationalism.\u201D Senator Blaque was quick to respond,
    stating in a unicast holofeed interview that \u201Cin a political climate of civility
    and honesty, the Caldari ideally would be the last to accuse anyone of nationalism.\u201D
    \  \n  \nThis last month has seen the candidate\u2019s approval ratings make a
    sharp turn upwards, with latest polls indicating that out of registered likely
    voters 58% would vote Blaque over incumbent president Souro Foiritan. The most
    commonly cited reasons for the choice are a wish for strong leadership and general
    public dissatisfaction with how long election proceedings have taken.   \n  \nIn
    what has come as a surprise to many analysts, President Foiritan has not responded
    strongly to Blaque\u2019s rhetoric, claiming that it is deliberately incendiary
    and designed only to provoke a response intended to paint opposing stances in
    a negative manner. It is not known at this point whether he intends to give replies
    to Blaque\u2019s statements, some of which have veered directly into the realm
    of ad hominem attacks against the incumbent."
