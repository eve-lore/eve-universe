- body: "After last night\u2019s statement from Perkone, CBT have been quick off the
    mark with a backlash of remarks. In a public statement CBT were unwilling to accept
    the findings of Perkone and the supposed evidence from their contact Kyogen Steiner,
    demanding that something be done to investigate the proof of their findings. As
    of yet no hard proof of any kind has come to light and CBT do not feel that words
    are enough of an argument.   \n  \nCBT have asked that a direct apology be given
    from Perkone and that this matter be discussed in private without use of the public
    Galnet.   \n  \nAlready share prices are showing signs of volatility, with some
    shareholders drawing out of both companies completely. As such a turbulent rift
    rises between these two large and prominent corporations, what can be said for
    the welfare of the State?   \n  \nTime will surely tell what happens as these
    two previous corporate friends go into long and surely heated talks."
