- body: "The Quafe Company today announced that they will be launching a brand new
    soft drink, Quafe Ultra, later this week. The drink, which will be the first new
    product to be marketed by the Quafe Company in over twenty years, promises consumers
    \u201Cthe refreshing flavor you\u2019ve come to know and love \u2013 with a twist!\u201D
    Preliminary ad campaigns have been launched in nearly every region in colonized
    space, with commercial rotation on the networks expected to reach record levels
    within a short time. \u201CThey\u2019ve outdone themselves this time,\u201D said
    senior analyst Brill Stone. \u201CWe\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a bigger campaign
    than this anywhere.\u201D  \n  \nThe drink itself, a promuform-and-guarana concoction
    closely related to the \u201Cpower potions\u201D so popular among Caldari students
    and businessmen, is portrayed by advertisements as nothing short of a wonder tonic
    capable of turning the plodding, thankless grind of everyday life into a passionate,
    energetic adventure. One such ad depicts a group of Amarrian theology students
    outside St. Junip\u2019s Cathedral in Dam-Torsad, one of Amarr Prime\u2019s oldest
    and most definitive landmarks. The youngsters\u2019 study meet turns into a wild
    party after one of the girls pops a can of Quafe Ultra, resulting in the cathedral\u2019s
    single massive spire being portrayed in rather an unwholesome allegorical light.
    \  \n  \nAlready several parties within the Amarr Empire have voiced their lack
    of amusement at the commercial, among them the Ardishapur Family, the Theology
    Council and the Royal Amarr Institute. Bedaliba Izon, spokesman for the Ardishapurs,
    was quoted earlier today as saying that the ad \u201Ctypifies the kind of flippant,
    devil-may-care attitude that can undermine even the strongest of civilizations.\u201D
    \  \n  \nQuafe officials were unavailable for comment."
