    - In what many have termed an unusual development, Angel Cartel forces - by some
    accounts actually members of a breakaway faction - have shipped large supplies
    of food to the Konora system and directly distributed them to the various mining
    and industrial colonies scattered across the system. The ground forces accompanying
    the food shipments have reportedly secured the colonies and a spokesman known
    as 'Commander Origen' has asserted control of the territories \"on behalf of the
    citizens of Konora system.\"\n\nReports from within the colonies remain sketchy
    but fluid router communications remain in place and the Kaalakiota Corporation
    facility remains secure and under control of station security. Kaalakiota are
    believed to be seeking urgent talks with the Republic government with regard to
    arranging passage for Home Guard units across Republic territory. No comment on
    this has been made by the government, but a brief statement has been released
    confirming that the Freedom Extension station and all gates remain operational
    and protected by sentry guns. The statement also repudiated all claims by Angel
    forces to be acting on behalf of local citizens.\n\nSources within the Republic
    Fleet have confirmed that Sanmatar Shakor has called a conference with senior
    admirals and the Metropolis regional commanders. An unconfirmed single source
    has claimed that the commander of a Thukker Tribe military caravan has been been
    invited to attend via holographic link. With commentators already comparing the
    Konora situation to the Skarkon Crisis of YC110, a spokesman for the Republic
    government has emphasised that it is determined to act with urgency to remedy
    matters."
