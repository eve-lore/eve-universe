- body: "The Bleak Lands - At 11:50 Standard EVE Time today, the following message
    was transmitted over several independent media frequencies by an individual identifying
    himself as Ode Goriad. \n\n\" _You thought we were gone._ _You were wrong._ \"
    \  \n  \nMultiple sources within the Amarr Navy have confirmed that within minutes
    of the transmission, unidentified military vessels mounted a concerted attack
    upon 7th Fleet installations all across The Bleak Lands region. Attempts to mount
    a coordinated response were hampered by a scheduled downtime of the region's military
    communications network, leaving local units isolated and forcing them to defend
    as best they could with whatever vessels they had available. \n\nWhen the communications
    arrays came back online, and the full scope of what was until that point believed
    to be a localized problem was made clear, the 7th Fleet immediately activated
    reserve units to reinforce their positions. Most reported however that the attacking
    forces had already dispersed by the time they arrived. At 1400 Admiral Saracen
    issued the following statement: \n\n\"At 12:00 today the terrorist organization
    known as The Defiants launched a series of scattered raids on our facilities across
    the region, which were swiftly beaten back by my indomitable Fleet. The physical
    damage was superficial, but the 7th Fleet does not suffer fools gladly. I have
    worked long and hard to bring this region back under Amarr Navy control and I
    will not permit these barbarians to destabilize the peace we have built. The 7th
    Fleet is mobilizing all its forces as I speak, and we will burn our enemies out
    from the holes they are hiding with the full force of our holy wrath.\" \n\nJust
    a few days ago it seemed that there might finally be an end in sight to the troubles
    that have plagued The Bleak Lands. Today's events show that, once more, the region
    balances on the edge of a dangerous precipice."
