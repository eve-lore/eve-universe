- body: "The three candidates for the Federation presidency are set to find their
    ideal emissaries to run their all-important election campaign. Each candidate
    has formulated his own way of finding those pilot corporations most suitable and
    to their liking. The corporations that work most diligently will have the honor
    of nominating one of their own to become an emissary for their chosen candidate.
    As even further incentive they will also become proud owners of a Navy issue Dominix
    battleship. \n\nDelegates for the candidates are now in position in strategic
    locations throughout the Federation, ready to hand out assignments to members
    of the participating corporations. Mentas Blaque has accused Eman Autrech of jumping
    the guns and allowing his delegates to hand out assignments earlier than allowed,
    but independent observers of the elections have stated that Autrech followed regulations
    to the letter. Still, Blaque and sitting president Souro Foiritan were left scrambling
    to get their own delegates into action in time. For those eager to participate
    in the dynamic Gallentean democracy a full list of delegates and their locations
    will be posted shortly through a different medium."
