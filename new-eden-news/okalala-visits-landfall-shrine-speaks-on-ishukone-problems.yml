- body: '_New Caldari - Minedrill CEO Soisonen Okalala made a surprise visit to the
    Landfall Shrine on New Caldari Prime today, where he laid a wreath at the Evacuation
    Memorial and spoke with the shrine''s chief steward and many of the Shrine''s
    Marine honor guard. Notable to many was the fact that Okalala traveled without
    an Ishukone Watch detail, instead accompanied by bodyguards wearing emblems of
    the Caldari Providence Directorate._


    _After his visit to the Shrine, Okalala held a short press conference, where reporters
    bombarded him with questions about Ishukone''s overall health. He made it clear
    that he remains upbeat about his parent corporation, calling their recent stock
    problems a "temporary decline" and claiming a rebound could be expected soon._


    _"The board has made it clear to me and the other subsidiary CEOs that a decision
    will come within the next two weeks," he announced,  going on to say that "Ishukone''s
    core businesses -- like the mining and manufacturing that Minedrill does -- are
    as strong as ever."_


    _The surprise announcement buoyed Ishukone''s stock, which rebounded slightly
    after his remarks. However, Ishukone''s press office has refused to confirm or
    deny the timetable for a CEO decision._'
