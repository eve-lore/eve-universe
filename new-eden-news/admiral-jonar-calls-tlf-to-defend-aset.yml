    TRIBAL LIBERATION FORCE PILOTS :::\n\nPilots of the TLF,\n\nAn undertaking of
    gravest importance lies before us today. The Amarr Empire has gained access to
    confidential information about the disaster on the asteroid mine in Aset. They've
    jumped to some alarming conclusions, and taken action which has forced us into
    a defensive position. Following is your briefing on the situation at hand. This
    is for your eyes only.\n\nAccording to our experts, the collapse was caused by
    an item of unknown origin buried deep within the asteroid's core. We believe the
    excavations of our mining team activated it, but we won't be able to gather conclusive
    data until we have retrieved the item and rescued the miners who are still trapped
    down there.\n\nOur scientists and techs are convinced this item is the cause of
    the power outages and equipment failures  we have been experiencing. We are working
    as fast as we can to get those miners out and retrieve the item from the rock,
    but we need to retain space superiority for this. If the enemy is able to take
    control of the system we will have to abandon our efforts.\n\nThe gold-backed
    bastards are likely to throw everything they've got at this system. We must repel
    them. I will repeat this for emphasis: we must repel them. Failure is out of the
    question. They cannot be allowed to gain a foothold here. \n\nMother Matar relies
    on your wings this day. Do not let her down.\n\nAdmiral Jonar\n\nRepublic Fleet"
