- body: "Caldari Prime \u2013 Tibus Heth, the dictator whose mercurial rise to power
    has shocked New Eden, has just raised the flag of the Caldari State over the city
    of Arcurio on Caldari Prime, in the Gallente Federation capital system of Luminaire.
    \n\nThe historical act follows a conversation with President Foiritan, in which
    Tibus allegedly threatened to bomb Gallentean civilians from space, all of whom
    are segregated from former Caldarian expatriates by President Foiritan\u2019s
    own decree. Tibus also stated that this action ends nearly two hundred years of
    Federation \"occupation\", and that although the path to Gallente Prime was clear,
    he did not consider it as a \"show of good faith\". \n\nTerms of the negotiated
    \"truce\" stipulate that Mr. Heth\u2019s sovereignty claim is for the planet of
    Caldari Prime alone, and not for the system of Luminaire. Although the bulk of
    Caldari Navy forces are expected to return immediately to Caldari territories,
    some \"military assets\" are going to remain over Caldari Prime, although the
    exact composition of this force is not known at this time. \n\n_Posted 15:47 GMT_"
