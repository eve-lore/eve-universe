    Prime - Royal Heir Yonis Ardishapur has personally ordered a massive injection
    of funds to be made available to the 24th Imperial Crusade for the purposes of
    reconstruction in the war-torn Ezzara system. Ezzara has been the scene of bitter

    the beginning of the conflict in YC110. The system has changed hands several times
    and its infrastructure is significantly degraded.\n\nIn addition to the funds,
    the Ammatar Fleet has confirmed that at the order of the Heir, the 1st Mandate
    Redemptionist Brigade is to take up duties assisting in the reconstruction of
    vital infrastructure in Ezzara. Primarily a logistical and engineering brigade,
    the 1st Redemptionist is composed of three regiments of penal troopers drawn from
    the ranks of dishonored Ammatar Mandate forces and civilians convicted of aid
    or sympathy for defectors."
