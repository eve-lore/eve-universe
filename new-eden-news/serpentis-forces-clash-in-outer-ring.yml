- body: "Ships under the command of Serpentis Admirals have been spotted patrolling
    the regions of Fountain, Outer Ring, and Cloud Ring recently, causing tensions
    to rise in the organizations inhabiting those areas. Yesterday saw a force of
    four Vindicator battleships and an Ishtar spar with NORAD forces in the system
    of 4C-B7X. \n\nNORAD forces, alert to the presence of hostiles in 4C-B7X, quickly
    mounted a blockade of the station. As the Serpentis undocked, the NORAD patrol
    began to open fire on their ships, causing the Serpentis to retaliate. The resulting
    battle saw two NORAD battleships go up in flames, along with a support cruiser,
    and one of the Serpentis losing his ship. After some heated words were exchanged,
    the Serpentis patrol continued, where it was attacked in the AN-G54 system by
    members of the same alliance. During a pitched battle, two Vindicators were destroyed
    and the rest of the patrol scattered. \n\nTuvan Orth, head of Internal Security
    for the Serpentis Corporation, had this to say about the incident: \u201CThe Serpentis
    Corporation is currently patrolling its assets to determine which are the most
    vulnerable, and assessing their combat readiness. Entities that pursue hostilities
    with us will be noted, and punished.\u201D When asked what this punishment would
    entail, Orth declined to comment. \n\nSarpati's officers contend that they were
    simply looking after their assets, and that this attack is not the first. \u201CFor
    years now we've been cataloging attacks against corporation assets,\u201D Commodore
    Beresick said, \u201CAnd, to be honest, the list is quite long. This only adds
    to it.\u201D \n\nThe Serpentis Corporation, based in the Fountain region, still
    reaps tremendous profits from pharmaceutical sales and rumored booster marketing.
    V. Salvador Sarpati has made enough profit off of these sales to hire the Guardian
    Angels to protect his assets. Sarpati has been the target of recent investigations
    by both DED and Mordu's Legion, but has evaded arrest so far."
