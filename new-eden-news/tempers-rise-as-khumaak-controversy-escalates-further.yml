- body: "In the six days since the Sebiestor tribe first put forth their motion to
    place a ban on the ceremonial Khumaak the Minmatar Republic has been split on
    the issue, with the schism between the two camps widening every day. According
    to a source inside the Republic\u2019s Tribal Council, a council meeting yesterday
    saw harsh exchanges between Tenerhaddi Dykon, the Krusual tribe leader, and Karin
    Midular, leader of the Sebiestor Tribe.  \n  \nAccording to the source Midular
    has been quoted as raising her voice at Dykon, calling him a \u201Cworthless savage\u201D
    in response to his claim that the Sebiestor tribe\u2019s \u201Ceffeminate attempts
    at leadership\u201D marked the beginning of the end for the proud Republic.   \n
    \ \nAnalysts agree that while the rhetoric itself could, under normal circumstances,
    easily be classified as political hate speech, the deep resonance the Khumaak
    issue carries for the Minmatar has escalated the proceedings into a stand-off
    of sorts between the two tribes, with both sides adamantly refusing to back down.
    \  \n  \nThe Republic Security Services were reported two days ago to have changed
    the security category of official tribal gathering halls. When asked whether the
    possibility of violence within the tribes played a role in the change, Skiks Alfotada,
    Commander of Security for the RSS, stated: \u201CWe are not here to consider the
    possibility of violence. We are here to prevent it.\u201D   \n  \nThe situation
    has prompted wide-spread criticism of the Minmatar government\u2019s ability to
    get things done. \u201CWe must make adjustments to our system,\u201D said Malaetu
    Shakor, head of Republic Parliament, addressing reporters yesterday. \u201CThe
    past week has served to do nothing but highlight the monumental inefficiency of
    this formalized bickering. Parliament needs to have supreme executive authority
    when irreconcilable internal differences arise within the tribes. As things stand
    now, there\u2019s no telling what will come of the situation.\u201D"
