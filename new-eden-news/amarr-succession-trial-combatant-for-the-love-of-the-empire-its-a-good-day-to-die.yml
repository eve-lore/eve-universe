- body: "**UNKNOWN** \u2013 The fate of the Amarr Empire was decided this weekend
    as the first round of the Amarr Succession Trials concluded with the emergence
    of five champions, each possibly representing the next Emperor of the Amarr Empire.
    The champions are: For the House of Doriam Kor-Azor, **Ecliptical** of MASS; for
    the House of Idonis Ardishapur, **Detaitiv** of BIG; for the House of Jamyl Sarum,
    **Shrike** of Evolution; for the House of Davit Tash-Murkon, **Con\u2019Mal**
    of Everlasting Vendetta; and for the House of Temal Kador, **Warhound** of Pak.
    The galactic implications for the outcome of these trials are enormous, as not
    only will the victor of these Trials determine which of the Heirs shall rise to
    power, but also which Heirs are doomed to death by suicide as required by Amarr
    tradition.  \n\n\nThe Trials were held at an undisclosed location far beyond Empire
    space borders. The \u201Carena\u201D was a 40km by 40km area of space with a perimeter
    marked off by specialized force field arrays. The arrays used warp-scrambling
    and stasis-webifying technology to prevent combatants from leaving the field of
    engagement. Columns constructed of steel-reinforced asteroids on either side of
    the arena marked the starting points of both the \u201CRed\u201D and \u201CBlue\u201D
    teams. Ships were forbidden from moving or locking targets until specifically
    ordered to do so. When both teams were in position, a ten-second countdown commenced,
    after which the opposing fleets\u2014each composed of 4 frigates\u2014engaged
    each other in combat.  \n\n\nSome last minute tournament changes\u2014specifically,
    the new rule disallowing the use of sensor dampeners and energy neutralizers--forced
    some teams to abandon the tactics they had practiced for weeks in preparation
    for the Trials. House of Sarum combatants were especially challenged with the
    late rule change, as they competed first in the Trials.  \n\n\nThe teams deployed
    a variety of tactics, weapons and ship configurations with varied success. The
    frigate of choice was the Punisher, and most teams divided their ships into pairs
    of long-range \u201Csnipers\u201D with EM penetrating weapons and \u201Ctanks\u201D
    with shorter ranged, high-damage weapons and shield hardeners.  \n\n\nThe result
    was a brutal yet magnificent display of naval warfare, as the objective of both
    teams was nothing less than the unconditional destruction of the other side. In
    some cases, the arena was littered with the frozen corpses of fallen gladiators\u2014dead
    not from the hands of their victorious opponents, but from having committed ritual
    suicide as a result of being defeated in Trial combat. Lopsided battles became
    increasingly rare as the rounds advanced closer to the finals, at which point
    every victory was attained by the narrowest of margins. The team leaders, all
    of which were Amarr citizens, were fearless and fought as though answering directly
    to a higher providence. There was a passion in these trials that few outsiders
    have been privy to; it revealed the very soul of Amarr, and the conviction of
    their beliefs cannot be questioned. All of the combatants were gracious to one
    another even in defeat, wishing the victors well and praising the name of the
    House they fought so fiercely to represent.  \n\n\nEven as the Amarr Succession
    Trials continue to unfold before the eyes of the galaxy, the governments of the
    other states remain ominously quiet. No officials could be reached for comment,
    and more importantly, none of the Heirs would respond to our request for statements.
    A date for the final rounds has not yet been released."
