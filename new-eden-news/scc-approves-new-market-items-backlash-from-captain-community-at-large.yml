- body: "The SCC Advisory Council yesterday approved a variety of new sales commodities
    for general release on SCC-regulated interstellar markets. Notable among them
    are such items as long-anticipated learning skill packs from the Society of Conscious
    Thought, material which will give advanced students the possibility of, as a SOCT
    press release puts it, \"taking their potential to the stars and beyond.\" The
    University of Caille and the Republic University yesterday also released the fruits
    of what has been their joint project over the last three months: the first batch
    of preparatory learning materials for the upcoming changes to be made to SCC interstellar
    markets in the coming months.   \n  \nWhat really has heads turning, however,
    is the unanimous patent finalization of a new class of pod-fitted star vessel,
    the heavy assault ship. The finalization, approved only a few days ago by the
    SCCAC, is the third of its kind to take place over the course of the last two
    months. It has left market speculators confused, and thoroughly outraged the growing
    contingent of obsolescent non-capsule-fitted bridge captains who feel they're
    being left behind in the backwash of new technology.   \n  \n\"It is our strong
    belief that these new developments are not good for the world at large, neither
    socially nor economically,\" said Tomas Andeluth, Chairman of BCE (Bridge Captains
    for Egality), a newly-founded organization intended to protect the interests of
    non-capsuleer starship captains.   \n  \n\"Capsule-fitted pilots represent only
    a fraction of the starship captains out there, yet their niche has been catered
    to almost exclusively over the past year. The consolidation of wealth in these
    people's hands is growing out of proportion. Too much power -- both technological
    and economical -- is going to them, and too fast. If this continues, it could
    lead to massive recession and millions of jobs lost, both for bridge-piloted vessel
    captains and their crew. We find it frankly irresponsible of these ships' designers
    to exclude the vast majority of the galactic population from their designs,\"
    stated Andeluth.   \n  \nResponding to these accusations, Maktina Obasa, director
    of public relations for Amarr ship designer and manufacturer Carthum Conglomerate,
    stated: \"We are a corporation. Capital is a corporation's lifeblood. In order
    to thrive, we must go where the capital is.\"   \n  \n\"The state of today's galactic
    economy is simply that the capsuleers have the cash. You cater to the group with
    the money, and the money comes to you. \"   \n  \nObasa's comments have provoked
    widespread ire, not least from Federation Marquee columnist Maxim Peltast, a long-outspoken
    opponent of the \"capsule craze.\" Making his point in characteristically coarse
    style, Peltast this morning appeared at Carthum Conglomerate's offices in Padrine,
    Duripant III's largest city, dressed in a loose garment composed, it appeared,
    entirely of blueprints, save for open patches on the front and the back where
    the journalist's genitalia and backside were in full view.   \n  \n\"Who finalizes
    the patents?\" Peltast was heard screaming as building security officers moved
    to subdue him. \"Who makes the real money from this? The designers? The manufacturers?
    Think again!\"   \n  \nA formal letter of apology from the Federation Marquee
    was reportedly received by Carthum Conglomerate's head office in Pimebeka a few
    hours later. Peltast's whereabouts are currently unknown, and it is uncertain
    at the time whether his weekly column, \"Mad World,\" will run in tomorrow's Marquee
    as scheduled."
