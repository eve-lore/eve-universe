- body: Expert ship builders of the Imperial Fleet Assembly Plants are working day
    and night completing a batch of ships that were expected for delivery this weekend
    at the Amarr Championship Award Ceremony. Due to an unfortunate incident at the
    docks, delivery of the fleet was postponed. An experimental new power core of
    an Imperial class battleship overheated, torching dozens of slave shipbuilders
    to their death. One Amarrian engineer was somewhat injured, causing the Amarrian
    Imperial Succession Council much distress. As a result, the council found it necessary
    to delay the Championship award ceremony, which was to take place this weekend,
    as the champions and their wingmen would not receive all their ships in time.
    According to Ammarri officials, the ceremony is expected to take place in one
    week from now.
