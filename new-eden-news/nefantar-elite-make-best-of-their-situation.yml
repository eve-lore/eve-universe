    the ex-Ammatar elite who returned to the Republic following the Elder War have
    found the transition difficult, there are a good many who have retained the optimism

    in the Ammatar Fleet before the Elder Invasion. He and a group of loyal officers
    commandeered a ship and defected to the Republic, even aiding the Elders for a
    brief time before the ship sustained too much damage to continue. \"It was glorious,\"
    Durgen said. \"We all thought we'd come to the Republic as heroes. The wayward
    sons, returning with the heads of our enemies held high. It wasn't to be so.\"
    \ \n  \nDurgen, like many others, found that the long-held beliefs and hatreds
    that had developed in the Republic were difficult to overcome. \"It didn't matter
    that I had defected. All that mattered was that, at one time, I had fought the
    Minmatar on the side of the Empire. I was a murderer, a butcher, a race-traitor,\"
    he said. \"I hoped to enlist in the Republic Fleet, but they would not have me.
    I was a security risk, they said. A potential spy for the Empire. \"  \n  \nDurgen
    has been able to find work, as a low-grade security operative for the Minmatar
    Mining Corporation. \"It's respectable,\" he said. \"It doesn't pay well and I'm
    constantly being watched by my superiors. Many of my co-workers hate me for the
    crimes they believe I committed against the Republic, but I will win them over
    eventually. It will take hard work. I never expected this to be easy.\""
