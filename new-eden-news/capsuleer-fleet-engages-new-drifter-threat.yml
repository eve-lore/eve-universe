    the last few days there have been [surprise decloakings of unidentified structures
    throughout New Eden](http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/concord-assembly-places-genesis-fleet-and-ded-on-high-alert/).
    Along with the uncloaking of these structures there has been a sudden appearance
    of wormholes in some systems, with sleeper structures near the Unidentified Wormhole.
    But more importantly, there have been sightings of a new hostile force known as
    \"The Drifters\". This new force wields terrible power but is not undefeatable
    as several brave capsuleers and their crews have now proven.\n\n[![](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/66927/1/drifter2_550.jpg)](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/66927/1/drifter2.jpg)

    recent loss of a carrier to a Drifter battleship has been circulating Capsuleer
    channels with many worried that this could spell the destruction of many regions
    of New Eden where capital and supercapital ships cannot enter for defense.\n\nOn
    February 17th a fleet warped onto a Drifter battleship, engaged and successfully
    destroyed it by \"putting a lot of ECM on the Drifter battleship before shooting
    it\" in the words of one pilot. Capsuleer Freelancer117 pointed out his main reason
    for joining the fleet was that he \"was afraid his normal business in empire space
    was about to be disrupted again. Like Sansha Kuvakai had a few years ago.\"\n\nAccording
    to several capsuleers involved, confirmation of the kill by CONCORD was never
    received, sparking rumors and talks of a conspiracy.\n\nDr. Frenjo Borkstar mentioned
    that in an earlier engagement, his peaceful hails were ignored. The only reply
    was an unprovoked attack; he barely escaped after 5 volleys from the Drifter while
    he was attempting to warp out. He escaped with only 35% structural integrity.\n\n[![](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/66927/1/drifter1_550.jpg)](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/66927/1/drifter1.jpg)

    provided some more information; \"At first, we managed to reduce the vessel's
    'double shield' layer to standard shielding, but then, we were greeted with a
    far superior weapon \xAD There is no official name known for this, but we have
    named it 'Lux Destructum', or 'The Destroying Light', it is comparable to a modern\xADday
    Titan's Doomsday Device, albeit battleship sized. A Hyperion battleship was destroyed
    in one volley from this weapon.\"\n\nIt is important to note that the destruction
    of this new foe required significant firepower and co\xADordination, with many
    brave souls putting the lives of their ships crew on the line in an attempt to
    combat this new threat, putting down their distrust and in some cases hatred of
    each other."
