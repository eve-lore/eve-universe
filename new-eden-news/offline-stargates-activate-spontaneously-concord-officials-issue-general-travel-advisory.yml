- body: "At just after 02:00 EVT last night, a large number of offline stargates spontaneously
    came online, opening access to eight previously closed-off regions of space.   \n
    \ \nCONCORD officials have issued a travel advisory intended to dissuade pilots
    from entering the newly-accessible regions due to \u201Cunforeseeable dangers,\u201D
    but since CONCORD\u2019s jurisdiction does not extend to these regions they have
    not been able to issue any mandates. Capsuleers are reported to be roaming the
    new regions already.   \n  \nThe regions were closed off twenty years ago in the
    wake of a rogue drone attack which left a research outpost, then-headquarters
    of a Gallente research project known as Operation Spectrum Breach, in ruins.   \n
    \ \nOperation Spectrum Breach was a Federation-funded research project intended
    to create openings into regions of unexplored space and facilitate the colonization
    of new worlds for a rapidly-expanding Gallente Federation.   \n  \nThe project
    was cancelled after the worker drones at the project\u2019s main outpost went
    berserk, killing hundreds. Reports of rogue drone attacks from several other areas
    within the eight regions had surfaced concurrently. To ward off the drones\u2019
    potential expansion into trade lanes and inhabited areas, the project\u2019s supervisors
    had every gate leading into the eight regions closed off.   \n  \nIt is not known
    what caused the drones to go rogue; many speculate that some form of virus was
    at play, while others believe that mechanical malfunction or design error are
    to blame.   \n  \nFederation officials have expressed surprise and bafflement
    at the unprecedented occurrence. According to a senior-level aide within the Office
    of the President, an investigation is \u201Cset to be underway.\u201D"
