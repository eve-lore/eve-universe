- body: "Luminaire - As the universe holds its collective breath on the first weekend
    of this years Alliance Tournament, the Federation's massive leisure industry is
    forecasting record profits for the close of the current financial quarter. Huge
    quantities of ISK have already been spent by consumers who are intent on using
    the event as an excuse to throw the grandest and most extravagant of parties.
    \n\nIn previous years, the Tournament only drew the enthusiasm and support of
    a minority audience consisting primarily of other capsuleers, but it would seem
    that this year interest in the competition has spread like wildfire to many regular,
    planet-bound citizens across the Federation. \n\nAgrastyn Kues, Chief Coordinator
    of Public Relations for the Bank of Luminaire in the Essence region, had this
    to say: \u201CWell, it is no surprise to us that an event of this magnitude is
    generating so much interest in the public domain, and we are pleased that our
    support of the event as a major sponsor has led to the generation of so much business
    and investment inside the Federation's borders.\u201D \n\nEgonics Inc. have recorded
    massive sales of their Special Edition Tournament Egone, which has already sold
    out on pre-order, even though it is initially tied to the subscription to Championship-only
    broadcasts. The package includes an option to unblock the music broadcast after
    the Tournament final, but Egonics has successfully banked on public interest in
    the event to sell out of subscriptions to the full package. \n\nThe initial demand
    was in fact so great that Egonics struggled to keep both their physical and their
    virtual shelves stocked, and a source within the company has confirmed that they
    were forced to employ an extra thirty-two thousand technicians at production centres
    (such as their massive factory in Blameston) to keep up. The company recently
    announced that they have also installed a new wide-band transmitter in Uphene,
    at an estimated cost of 163 billion ISK in anticipation of the additional bandwidth
    requirements that the Tournament media streams will require. \n\nThe billions
    of people preparing to watch the event will of course be looking to quench their
    thirst, and the major brands in the drinks business have already begun massive
    advertising campaigns to win over the Tournament audience. \n\nThe Quafe Company
    seem to be doing well and have reported that their pre-Tournament sales are up
    by at least 12% from the same period last year. Riesves Boricon, Assistant Marketing
    Director at Quafe, was in a buoyant mood yesterday when in a press release he
    stated: \u201CWe were expecting a surge in sales, but this year's figures are
    unprecedented. It seems that this time around Tournament fever is gripping the
    whole universe! Our distribution freighters have been working non-stop for weeks
    now simply trying to keep up, and our crews are certainly enjoying the overtime.
    Hopefully it will calm down closer to the Event as people get their refrigerators
    stocked - otherwise our staff won't have time to catch any of the matches themselves!\u201D
    \n\nMore cynical critics have noted that Quafe's sales may have been boosted by
    the clever use of Capsuleer imagery on the packaging of their products, which
    include collectible, limited edition cans, bottles and cartons which sport team
    colours and list the profiles and statistics of many of this year's competitors.
    \n\nIt isn\u2019t just the major corporations who are cashing in this year. The
    owners of small bars and taverns across the Federation have been investing in
    new entertainment arrays and stocking up on consumables. Many believe that massive
    screens that place the viewer at the heart of the action will draw their client\xE8le
    into supporting and following the Tournament throughout the season. \n\nJenville
    Argaund, the owner of a small bar at The Scope Development Studio in Orvolle,
    has even taken on extra staff in anticipation; \u201CI have employed an extra
    twenty girls to ensure that every need of my customers is attended to, and I am
    hoping that every employee and resident on this station will come by to watch
    the match, have a drink, and stay on afterwards for additional entertainment.
    The new array may have cost me a fortune, but I expect to recoup every single
    ISK, and more besides. What better way to relax after a hard day at work than
    down the bar watching Capsuleers duel against a jaw-dropping backdrop of glittering
    stars!\u201D"
