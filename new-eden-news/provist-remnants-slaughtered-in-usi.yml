- body: "_Usi -_ Seven Provist Chimeras and one Wyvern were destroyed in Usi by a
    force of over 1000 capsuleers. The Wyvern, piloted by Kossen Jaikka, was destroyed
    after a little over an hour of fighting. The Caldari Navy has confirmed kills
    on all members of the renegade 'Octopus' Squadron members who had absconded with
    the capital ships, bringing an end to the massive manhunt which has captured attention
    over the past week.\n\nThe battle seemed to favor the Provist forces at the beginning,
    as even several hundred capsuleers were unable to overwhelm the remote shield
    boosting capabilities of the capital ships. Numerous ships were lost to the drones
    and fighters deployed by the Provists. However, eventually capsuleer forces reached
    a critical mass where they were able to overwhelm even the repair capabilities
    of the carriers. One by one, the carriers began to fall, and as their remote assistance
    capabilities diminished, so too did the ability for the Provists to mount any
    sort of defense. Though stray ships continued to be picked off by drones and fighters,
    the Wyvern fell to sustained fire.\n\n\"The operation was a major success,\" said
    Wing Commander Hikemi Korrado. \"Though we had issues with capsuleers defending
    the Provists in past engagements, in this one we were lucky... It seems their
    criminal allies in Pandemic Legion were unable to enter Usi in force due to CONCORD
    restrictions.\"\n\nDespite Korrado's praise, a group of unaffiliated capsuleers
    calling themselves \"Spectre Fleet\" attempted to offer aide to the Provists,
    but it ultimately proved futile in the chaotic fighting.\n\nThe bounties will
    be paid out on the 23rd, pending final confirmation from Caldari Navy officials.
    Currently, the tally for this final engagement stands as follows:\n\n**Kossen
