    news from all across New Eden on the third anniversary of the Coronation of Empress
    Catiz I.\n\n**Coronation Anniversary Week Celebrations and Pilgrimages Limited
    by War Footing**\n\nAmarr, Domain  - As the Amarr Empire celebrates the Third
    Coronation Jubilee of Empress Catiz I, the extent of the revels has been limited
    by the war footing on which the Empire has been since the Triglavian Invasion
    began. While Amarr Prime, and in particular the Imperial City of Dam-Torsad, has
    had its population swollen by large numbers of pilgrims, their numbers have been
    fewer than on previous celebrations of Empress Catiz's coronation.\n\nDespite
    the lower numbers of pilgrims, military forces throughout the Amarr Empire have
    been on the highest alert for several days due to the large numbers of dignitaries
    travelling to Dam-Torsad. The Royal Heirs of the six houses of the Imperial Privy
    Council have been present on Amarr Prime for some weeks due to an extended series
    of meetings of the Amarr Empire's highest state council.\n\nThe Theology Council's
    various orders and committees have also been involved in a large number of meetings,
    not least concerning Empress Catiz's new doctrinal work _Pax e Kilizhi Do_ , or
    \"Peace of the Two Swords\". Most observers of the Amarr Imperial Court are expecting
    significant announcements will be made shortly, particularly given the extensive
    meetings of the Privy and Theology Councils over the last weeks.\n\n \n\n**Triglavian
    Invasion Forces Strike at Multiple Amarr Regions; House Fleets Respond**\n\nAridia,
    Genesis and Kor-Azor  - While the Amarr authorities have prepared for the coronation
    anniversary, the Triglavian Invasion has continued to strike at various regions
    of the Empire. Invasion forces have been attacking Amarr systems in the regions
    of Aridia, Genesis and Kor-Azor, with multiples forces from the Imperial Navy,
    Royal Khanid Navy and fleets of Houses Kador and Kor-Azor responding.\n\nFresh
    from a successful defence of the Mishi system in Aridia, units of the Royal Khanid
    Navy have responded to the latest attack on the region by a Triglavian invasion
    group. Queen Zidarez Khanid herself has been escorted by her personal squadron
    to Amarr Prime in order to take part in the jubilee ceremonies. The Kador Family's
    fleets have been heavily involved with defence of Amarr holdings in the Genesis
    system, and were once again in action as an invasion force struck at the Genesis
    border between Amarr and Gallente space.\n\nWith a major Triglavian invasion force
    emerging in the Kor-Azor region, the ruling house's formidable fleet was naturally
    involved in operations to combat the invaders. The extensive domains of the Amarr
    Empire continue to be a major target for Triglavian invasion groups, with the
    new expansion of the Collective's war outwards into low-security space evidently
    leading to even more assaults against New Eden's largest empire.\n\n \n\n**In
