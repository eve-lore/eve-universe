- body: "The Crielere command has finally come out with a statement on the recently
    revealed information that several valuable blueprints were missing from their
    inventory. In the statement the commanders confirm that the lost blueprints were
    stolen, but will reveal no further details while an internal investigation is
    taking place. The commanders also acknowledged that the blueprints lost were unique
    and of considerable value, though they insisted their loss would not impinge on
    the research efforts being made at the facility.  \n  \nFinally, the commanders
    lamented the fact that this news went public and have already admonished the junior
    research assistant responsible for leaking the news. Such matters should be dealt
    with internally and not in full view of the public. While the commanders are optimistic
    that the investigation will lead to a satisfactory conclusion, they have no obligation
    to keep the public informed about the progress or results of it."
