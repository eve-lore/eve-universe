    at New Caldari](http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=1457&tid=6)
    on the 12th of May, 109 and the status of the ongoing investigation. The main
    culprit in the attack, Weyln Xemal of the Guardian Shadows Corporation, has gone
    into hiding after his wingmen were killed resisting arrest. \n\nCommander Kusgarl
    of the Caldari Navy issued the report detailing this turn of events. It opens
    with a section dealing with the events in new Caldari that officially confirms
    the details of the massacre. Pilots of the Guardian Shadows assisted by CAIN attacked
    a freighter they believed to intend harm against the Caldari State. In the attack,
    the Guardian Shadows destroyed the freighter so completely that the Caldari Navy
    was unable to recover enough wreckage remains to identify the passengers or what
    they may have been carrying on their persons, their reasons for doing so remain
    unknown. \n\nWhen the Caldari investigation attempted to question Weyln Xemal
    during their investigation, Weyln and his wing-mates attempted to evade capture.
    Caldari Marines were detailed to arrest the members of Guardian Shadows due to
    this refusal to answer the navy\u2019s questions. When confronted with arrest,
    Weyln\u2019s wing-mates resisted with deadly force and were subsequently killed
    in a brief firefight with the heavily armed marines. Weyln\u2019s whereabouts
    are still unknown. Commander Kusgarl stated that the affair was \u201Can unfortunate
    setback in our investigation\u201D and that he \u201Chopes still that the leader
    of this attack will turn himself over to the State for questioning.\u201D \n\nHe
    then declared that the act of destroying the frieghter was one that must be accounted
    for and that more charges may be forthcoming. Commander Kusgarl trusts that anyone
    questioned \u201Cwill be more cooperative than the Guardian Shadows have been.\u201D"
