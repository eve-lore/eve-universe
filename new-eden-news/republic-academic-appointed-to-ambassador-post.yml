    of renowned long time academic Keitan Yun as the nation\u2019s ambassador on the
    CONCORD Assembly. \"Mr. Yun has served our nation well in the capacity of our
    universities,\u201D she said. \u201CNo man is better versed in our culture or
    history than him. He is a true Minmatar patriot, and will represent us well before
    the Assembly.\" \n\nDespite his new responsibilities as an international diplomat,
    the enthusiastic Sebiestor will still retain his honorary fellowship with Republic
    University. \"This is a great honor,\" he commented. \"I\u2019ve spent most of
    my life studying the history of this great Republic. I never imagined the day
    would come when I could be so close to the making of that history, and I sincerely
    thank the esteemed Prime Minister for the opportunity to serve.\" \n\nParliament
    Head Maleatu Shakor was uncharacteristically supportive of the prime minister\u2019s
    choice. \"About time she picked someone worthy of the title,\" he commented. \"Hopefully
    the man has the spine to stand up to her nonsensical politics and truly speak
    for Minmatar for once.\" \n\nAmbassador Yun will make his first appearance before
    the CONCORD Assembly this Sunday in a closed-door session."
