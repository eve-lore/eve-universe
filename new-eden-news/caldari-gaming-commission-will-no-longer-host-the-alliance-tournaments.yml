- body: "Dabel Kaelikohani, founder of the Caldari Gaming Commission (CGC), announced
    yesterday that the Alliance Tournament will no longer be hosted by the Commission.
    Kaelikohani released a statement to all major news agencies concerning the future
    of the CGC. \n\nIn the statement Kaelikohani explained why he felt that hosting
    the Tournament was no longer a feasible business venture for the CGC ' After much
    deliberation the management of the CGC has come to the conclusion that hosting
    the Tournament will not be lucrative enough to excuse its costs in planning, taxes
    and other fees. We wish any other corporation the best of luck if they plan to
    continue the Tournament. Sadly the CGC does not see how you can run a healthy
    business combined with the enormous expenses the Tournament requires.'\n\nInstead
    of the universally celebrated tournaments the CGC will now focus on smaller quizzes
    and challenges across Caldari controlled space. ' We won't abandon the capsuleers
    just yet,' said Kaelikohani, 'They really are the best audience you can hope for
    and we wish to continue working with them for years to come.'"
