- body: "Sarum Prime - In what eyewitnesses are describing as an \"epic, violent clash
    between empires\", the Imperial Navy has just engaged a third Minmatar-Thukker
    fleet over the third planet of the Sarum Prime system, 'Mekhios'. Multiple worlds
    within the Amarr Empire, in particular the Kor-Azor Region, have been attacked
    with orbital bombardments just prior to the surface landings of hundreds of thousands
    of Minmatar troops, who despite their uniform ethnicity cannot be confirmed to
    be Republic infantrymen. \n\nThe invaders are believed to be using Insorum in
    their bombardments, saturating ground targets with airborne variants of the Vitoc-neutralizing
    agent before commencing their assaults. \n\nIt is unclear why the Imperial Navy
    has chosen Sarum Prime to makes its stand, where it appears the bulk of the Empire's
    warships are either onsite or en-route to the battle. \n\n_Posted 13:48 GMT_"
