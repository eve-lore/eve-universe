- body: "Woratome Kikawa, Chief Executor of the newly-founded Independent Gaming Commission
    last week announced that the Commission will officially take over handling of
    capsuleer alliance tournaments. \n\n\xB4I'm happy to announce that the Tournament
    will continue, but it is not longer strictly tied to one empire. To collect the
    funding needed for the tournament we now instead have investors from all four.
    From the Caldari State, we welcome members of the Mercantile Club; from the Minmatar
    Republic we enjoy the expertise of the Leisure Group; the Gallentean Bank of Luminaire
    will provide us with financial backing; and the Amarr Certified News will cover
    all news from the Tournament this year. \xB4 \n\nMr Kikawa began his career with
    the Caldari Gaming Commission last year as a top executive, quickly landing the
    hosting contracts they needed to continue the tournament. His skill at negotiation
    and general business savvy had him quickly ascending the corporate ladder. When
    the CGC was found guilty of tax evasion and announced their decision not to host
    the Tournament, Kikawa began lobbying to find a team of people that would host
    the Tournament independently of one single empire."
