    been issued on Oijanen II, closing all transport links into the Myrskaa metropolitan
    area and effectively placing the city in complete lockdown.


    Our news team in the area has also broadcast unconfirmed reports that a large
    detachment of State Peacekeepers have arrived on the scene, along with significant
    Home Guard and Caldari Navy assets.


    In an unprecedented move, the Caldari Navy has ordered the entire city to be placed
    under a quarantine nanoshield dome, which comes just forty eight hours after a
    cordon was placed around the Zainou owned Myrskaa District 36 South Medical Center,
    on the south side of the city.


    Its is believed that the majority of Myrskaa ''s thirty six million inhabitants
    are being held within the cordon of the city, beneath the quarantine nanoshield
    dome which is in the final stages of deployment.

    confiscation, along with the arrests of a number of members of the interstellar
    press.'
