- body: 'Yulai - An independent pilot has located the wreck of The Scope''s on-site
    media shuttle and recovered the data recorder from the wreckage. While the video
    feed seems to be corrupt, the camera logs are largely intact and we are streaming
    data from them now.


    Images assembled from the data show the horrific battle unfolding with the CONCORD
    fleet massing on the Minmatar-Thukker invaders attempting to repulse their savage
    attack on the CONCORD Bureau station. Suddenly a huge cynosural field opens up
    in system and the view is filled by the enormous bulk of what can only be a Ragnarok-class
    Titan.


    As the joint Minmatar forces began streaming towards Ragnarok, including lifepods
    from the capital-class vessels, CONCORD realigns their fire-power and begins hammering
    at the Ragnarok''s immeasurable bulk. Moments later the area around the Titan
    flares with thousand of incandescent missiles spreading over the battlefield.
    The feed abruptly terminates at this point.
