    Amarr pirate Stavros confirmed his bid for the Amarr throne today during an exclusive
    interview with Interstellar Reporters. While admittedly surprised and touched
    by the growing movement endorsing his bid for power, he also stated that \u201CAmarr
    is in a time of great need\u201D and as such pledged to \u201Cdo all [he] can
    to help\u201D. While he considers his policies more moderate than the militant
    Jamyl Sarum, he considers Doriam Kor-Azor a \u201Cdreaming pacifist\u201D and
    that he would support Sarum if his own bid for the throne was denied. \n\nThe
    full interview is printed below: \n\nThank you for taking the time to see me,
    Stavros.  \nA: It is no problem. I realize the importance of the media in the
    race to save Amarr. \n\nSincerest condolences on the passing of His Majesty the
    Emperor. Can you describe your relationship with him?  \nA: I think I can summarize
    the situation by saying there isn\u2019t a day that goes by when every true Amarr
    doesn\u2019t grieve a little for the passing of the Emperor. However, whilst I
    admire him as a great man and a man of peace, I feel that he was too far ahead
    of the times, too much of a dreamer. \n\nHow so?  \nA: Whilst we all desire peace,
    in this harsh universe sometimes the only way to achieve it is through war. \n\nThe
    Minmatar feel the exact same way. How do you feel about the Emperor's efforts
    to bridge the gap between the two states?  \nA: How can the great Amarr Empire
    strive for peace when it is surrounded by underhanded and nefarious people that
    are desperate to undermine it? The Minmatar are a cowardly race, we offered them
    servitude and a place in the galaxy and in return they resent us. They are a twisted
    people. I feel that his efforts were, at best, premature. \n\n'Premature', as
    in too soon for general acceptance or rejection of the enslavement of the Minmatar
    people?  \nA: The Minmatar resent us for our superior standing among the empires
    and republics of the galaxy. They resent our achievements, both culturally and
    technologically. I fail to see how peace can prevail when every single Minmatar
    wishes every single Amarr dead. \n\nDo you believe anything can be done to bridge
    the gap between the two states?  \nA: The Minmatar need to learn to accept us
    and they need to learn their place in the galaxy. That is all that can really
    be said on the matter. \n\nAre you currently aware of the movement to nominate
    you as a potential Successor to the Throne?  \nA: Yes, this came as a pleasant
    surprise to me. Whilst I have always been active in the politics of our fine galaxy,
    I had never considered myself for the position. However I feel that Amarr is in
    a time of great need, and as such I would like to do all I can to help. \n\nDo
    you consider yourself a spokesman for the Amarr people?  \nA: Yes, unlike the
    majority of candidates, I am a man of the people. I worked my way up from a lowly
    Impairor pilot to where I am today. I understand the common Amarr man and I feel
    that it is these people who are supporting me in this campaign. \n\nWhich other
    possible Successor do you consider yourself more in-line with politically: Doriam
    Kor-Azor or Jamyl Sarum?  \nA: I feel closer in terms of policy to Jamyl Sarum,
    although his policies are maybe a little harsh. However, he has the right ideas,
    unlike the Kor-Azor candidate who seems to be a dreamer rather than a realist.
    These are harsh times and harsh measures may be needed--although in moderation.
    I fear that Sarum may ignite a fire that will consume all of Amarr. \n\nIf your
    quest to ascend to the throne is for some reason deemed impractical, which candidate
    would you lend your support to, if asked?  \nA: I am under no illusions here,
    Draaven. I cannot match the other candidates in terms of influence. If anything,
    I want my campaign to serve as a warning to the future Emperor, whomever he may
    be, that all is not well and changes HAVE to be made. Currently I would have to
    favor Sarum, even if I do deem him a little overzealous. Putting Amarr into the
    hands of a dreaming pacifist is something I could never forgive. \n\nDo you wish
    to be quoted on that, Stavros?  \nA: Yes, you may quote me on that. Although I
    am by no means unconfident about the success of my campaign, the level of support
    I have received in the past few days since going public with my ambitions has
    been staggering. If it keeps up, who knows what will happen. \n\nHave you considered
    how the Caladari State or the Gallente Federation will view the ascension of either
    yourself or Sarum to the Throne?  \nA: I think that both of the races you mention
    will view whoever ascends to the throne with respect and admiration--as is due
    to any leader of the Amarr Empire. \n\nAnd what of Concord?  \nA: Concord, I fear,
    is overextending its influence. They are a police force, not a political entity.
    They are meant to serve the empires and republics, not dictate who governs them.
    \n\nDo you have m0o's support for this political move on your part?  \nA: m0o
    is gone. We were a group of individuals who did what was needed to survive. We
    weren\u2019t always proud of what we did, but due to our skill at combat and politics
    we survived and prospered. I learned much during my days with m0o about management
    and about the cultures of the various races that inhabit this galaxy, and I feel
    that this has given me an excellent base for my campaign. \n\nAren't you concerned
    that your affiliation with a corporation largely perceived as a marauding band
    of criminals will hurt your chances for the Succession?  \nA: I never wanted to
    compete for the Throne, it was my fellow Amarrians that convinced me to pursue
    it. If such a large group of my brothers and sisters wish me to run, then who
    am I to argue? \n\nDo you foresee any change of policy in the way remaining m0o
    members decide to conduct their business affairs?  \nA: Whilst m0o\u2019s actions
    weren\u2019t always on the straight and narrow, we always won against incredible
    odds. This is the kind of spirit that Amarr needs right now, before it is too
    late. Sadly, there are no remaining m0o members, as they have retired and given
    up spaceship command in favor of a more relaxed lifestyle. I am the last of them.
    \n\nThank you for taking a few moments with me, Stavros.  \nA: Cheers for the
    interview."
