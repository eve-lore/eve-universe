- body: "In a statement today by Frantian Brinor, Perkone's Warehouse Logistics and
    Factory Manager for Uemon, it was brought to the attention of The Scope that the
    mysterious attackers who have been plaguing the lower regions of The Forge may
    very well be pilots from CBT (Caldari Business Tribunal).  \n  \nAfter further
    scrutiny of the information given to Mr. Brinor by Kyogen Steiner earlier this
    evening in Uemon, Perkone has decided that an official statement had to be made
    on the matter, highlighting CBT\u2019s potentially catastrophic disloyalty to
    the State.  \n  \nIt was said, \u201CAfter close inspection of the information
    compiled and given to me by Kyogen Steiner, I found it odd that the pilots who
    are of Caldari origin have previous employment within CBT.\u201D  \n  \nAssured
    by this information, Perkone are now confident that CBT are up to something, and
    The Scope, as well as the rest of the State, will be watching for their reply.
    The Scope must also point out that CBT and Perkone are loyal business partners
    with one another, which therefore makes this an unstable position to be in."
