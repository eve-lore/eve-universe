    Ashes Figurehead Calls for Violence in Response to Unsubstantiated Conspiracy\n\nA
    holoreel has surfaced in which philosopher, poet, and radical extremist Kam\xED
    D\xEDa accuses the four major nations of partnering with capsuleers to secure
    dangerous Triglavian research. In this holoreel, the ideological figurehead of
    the Ashes of Turnur calls on those who follow her teachings to seek out and destroy
    facilities researching either the Triglavians or the Abyss.\n\nThe holoreel was
    delivered to the Scope anonymously. Our research indicates that it was first distributed
    through underground channels sometime last week. In it, D\xEDa accuses the intelligence
    agencies of the four major nations of conspiring with capsuleers to trade in Triglavian
    research, adding \u201CThick smoke rises to the heavens and blinds the immortals,
    but I see the giants hiding while their agents stoke the embers.\u201D\n\nD\xEDa\u2019s
    writings identify Triglavian technology and more broadly Abyssal Deadspace as
    corrupting influences on New Eden. A survivor of the Turnur disaster and the sole
    remaining member of her clan, D\xEDa blames the use of Triglavian technology for
    the destruction of her home planet. She has also condemned the Minmatar Republic
    for failing to prevent the catastrophe. \n\nThough Kam\xED D\xEDa inspired the
    Ashes of Turnur, the group has no combined hierarchy. The Ashes is a loose association
    of rebel clans and military deserters who abandoned the Republic to follow D\xEDa\u2019s
    philosophies. These philosophies are based on a vision of pre-occupation Matari
    that contradicts the findings of Republic historians and archaeologists. According
    to D\xEDa, prior to the Amarr invasion, Minmatar society focused less on the tribes
    and more on individual clans and personal freedoms. Freedoms that D\xEDa believes
    can only be regained through suffering and violence. As she puts it in her collection
    From the Flames, \u201DDeath has changed us, but it has also burnt away the lies
    of progress. So, let us be joyful, and show those who are less fortunate the lessons
    the fire taught us.\u201D\n\nThe philosopher\u2019s radical anti-Abyssal perspective
    has gained popularity beyond the borders of the Republic. Her writings have become
    bestsellers in the Gallente Federation. In the Amarr Empire, the Ministry of Internal
    Order has banned her work because they challenge all forms of national authority.
    Ashes of Turnur sympathizers have also been arrested on Caldari Prime. CONCORD
    has even declared the Ashes a cluster-wide terrorist organization following their
    attacks on Caldari facilities.\n\nThe Amarr, Minmatar, Caldari, and Gallente have
    all denied D\xEDa\u2019s claims of secret Triglavian investigations, dismissing
    her as a terrorist threat. D\xEDa offers no evidence of any such operations in
    her holoreel, or of capsuleer involvement, but suggests they are taking place
    in secret throughout highsec space: \u201CIn the heart of their kingdoms they
    fight over embers to win the honor of lighting their own pyre. I know what doors
    they open, I see the fire that walks through. Rejoice, my wild and wise ashes,
    for the time has come to smother their flames.\u201D\n\n### News In Brief\n\n-
    Pockets of sleeper activity detected in highsec. Armed forces of the four major
    nations assure the Scope containment Operations are underway.\n\n- The Scope reaffirms
    safety of Ret Gloriaxx in response to viewer concerns over Auviken silence.\n\n-
    EDENCOM claims changes to Triglavian werpost redeployment a sign of success.\n\n-
    SOE under pressure to reveal the source of new NET Resonators as CONCORD investigates.\n\n-
    Capsuleer designers flock to Paragon Hub following its launch.\n\n- Holders outraged
