- body: 'A recent report by the Federation Census Bureau reveals that the number of
    Minmatar immigrating to the Federation has been dropping noticeably in the past
    three months, with some analysts going so far as to suggest that a net flow of
    zero may be reached at some point in the future.


    Previously, the Federation was accepting a large and steady flow of Minmatar immigrants
    every month, but recent estimates have the numbers dropping by as much as 15%
    each month, with current trends this month anticipating a further drop.


    Most analysts agree that the rapid shift in immigration numbers is a response
    to the Elder Fleet''s strike on the Amarr Empire earlier this year, while a few
    also credit uncertainty about the Federation Navy and the Federal economy in the
    current cluster-wide turmoil as an additional impetus. The appointment of Maleatu
    Shakor as the titular head of the Republic and his recent pronouncements are hoped
    to stem the tide even further as the long-ailing Republic attempts to find its
    feet.'
