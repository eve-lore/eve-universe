- body: 'Penirgman, Domain - The Ministry of Internal Order has ordered its customs
    and border control forces to increase patrols in border systems. At the same time,
    reports from major cities in the Amarr Empire indicate that the MIO has increased
    its presence on the streets.


    When approached by the Scope, the MIO spokesman said, "With the dramatic increase
    in terrorist threats and other border security concerns in the past weeks, and
    with the Imperial Jubilee celebrations to come, the Ministry of Internal Order
    has increased patrols in several border regions."


    The Scope understands that Imperial Navy and Royal House fleets will be used to
    bolster patrols across the Amarr Empire. Elsewhere, reports from a number of major
    Amarr cities and several space stations in the Throne Worlds constellation have
    indicated that MIO forces have increased their visible presence on the ground.


    When pressed on the patrolling of Amarr cities and stations, the MIO refused to
    comment and would not elaborate on the mentioned "terrorist threats and border
    security concerns".'
