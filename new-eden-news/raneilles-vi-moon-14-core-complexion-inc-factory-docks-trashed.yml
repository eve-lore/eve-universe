- body: Earlier today an overloaded transport vessel bumped into some vital components
    of the outer docking mechanism at Raneilles VI - Moon 14 - Core Complexion Inc.
    Factory station. Damages to the docks were fortunately minimal but the ships hull
    was severely damaged causing a massive spill of the cargo of garbage. Cleaning
    is under way but until all the mess has been cleared up pilots are advised to
    stay clear of Raneilles VI - Moon 14 - Core Complexion Inc. Factory station or
    risk being stuck there for some time.
