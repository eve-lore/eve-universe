- body: "EFU - In the last hour, the Society of Conscious Thought have confirmed both
    their rumored contact with Genolution regarding events in Efu, and further details
    on the containment situation on board the Genolution biotech production facility.\n\nIn
    a press conference hosted from on board the station, SoCT Elder Mentor Matshi
    Raish confirmed the presence of the Kyonoke Plague on all nine decks that have
    been sealed off, remarking that the action was \"absolutely necessary to prevent
    further spread of the contagion\".\n\nSpeaking on behalf of both Genolution and
    the Society, Elder Raish confirmed that \"the Society of Conscious Thought has
    reached out to contacts in the locations affected in order to offer assistance
    with the current situation, and will work actively with all authorities across
    the cluster, as well as the CONCORD Assembly, to ensure that the crisis is brought
    to an acceptable and controlled resolution as soon as possible.\"\n\nWhen questioned
    regarding the number of individuals who may have been exposed, Elder Raish seemed
    open to revealing more details, explaining that \"the station security count places
    exactly seven hundred and twenty-nine thousand, one hundred and twelve individuals
    within the cordon at the time it was established. We believe at this stage that
    we have lost around sixty five thousand to early onset of the plague and that
    most, if not all of those still alive within the cordon have been exposed.\"\n\nUrging
    calm after the press responded with a barrage of questions, Elder Raish continued,
    informing the press that \"every possible avenue to resolve the situation and
    save as many lives as possible is being explored, and Genolution is working closely
    with the Imperial authorities to ensure that the issue is addressed quickly to
    minimize further loss of life.\n\n\"However, the Kyonoke Plague is an extremely
    voracious pathogen with a one hundred percent fatality rate, that spreads incredibly
    easily and can only be contained or destroyed via incredibly extreme methods.
    The only known methods of destroying the pathogen at this stage are exposure to
    extreme heat, or absolute zero in vacuum. We would like to avoid exposing those
    within the cordon to either.\" \n\nDespite additional questions, Elder Raish called
    a close to the press conference after approximately thirty minutes, before appearing
    to return to the crisis center that has been set up on board the station."
