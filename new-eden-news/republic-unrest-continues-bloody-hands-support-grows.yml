- body: "Matar - \u201COne ISK for Midular\u201D said many of the banners at a large
    protest rally held today. Local police forces estimated the attendance at around
    two million people, who packed the main promenade of Matar Prime. The protest,
    organized by political newcomer \u201CVoices of Matar\u201D party, coincided with
    marches all across the Republic as the government faces ever-growing anger and
    disillusionment.  \n  \nThe Republic, already under fire for its heavy-handed
    handling of past protests, responded by stating that it respected the views and
    opinions displayed at these rallies, and that while it was quite happy for its
    citizens to enjoy their freedom of speech, it urged the protesters to remain peaceful.
    The government spokesman took the opportunity to remind attendant press that the
    numbers at these protests only constituted a relative minority.  \n  \nThe Bloody
    Hands of Matar, the subject of hot controversy due to their recent violent actions
    at the Dober Harn riots, have witnessed a swelling of their ranks as dissatisfaction
    grows. It seems that what once started as a simple ideal and symbol has begun
    to form into a far more serious movement. Countless newcomers to The Bloody Hands'
    cause have cited the deep frustration they feel at the perceived callousness of
    the government's handling of Captain Muritor and of its blatant dismissal of the
    recent riots and other protests.  \n  \nTheir support from the Ushra'Khan alliance,
    one that they claimed to model themselves on, has been less apparent. Following
    the interment of Captain Muritor's body last week, Tar Kovsky stated, \u201CWe
    understand the frustration of groups like The Bloody Hands of Matar, which makes
    it hard for us to condemn their mistakes. Our people need hope, though, and not
    continued frustration. If the youth would take a more active role in tribal politics,
    they might find the solution there\u2026we don't think that attacking the planetary
    police will accomplish much other than turning people against them\u201D.  \n
    \ \nWhile certain Minmatar capsuleer groups such as Namtz'aar k'in have echoed
    Mr. Kovsky's sentiments, others have stepped forward and praised the Hands' defiance.
    \"The Ushra'Khan need to take a long, hard look at themselves before they decide
    to comment on other terrorist groups,\" an unnamed source stated.  \n  \nAlready
    the images of angry young Matari protesters have defined the rising wave of impatience,
    and now, with their faces covered in blood-red handprints, they are becoming one
    of many indicators of a growing momentum behind the Bloody Hands."
