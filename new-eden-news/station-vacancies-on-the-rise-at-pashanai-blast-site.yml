    Pashanai - Commercial and residential station vacancies have risen sharply since
    the [Bloody Hands of Matar ](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Bloody_Hands_of_Matar)attack
    on the Ministry of War Bureau Offices station at Pashani III. Businesses across
    the system continue to cancel rental agreements, while some homes have simply
    been abandoned.


    Kadeyn Osirani, a rental agent at the local Amarr Certified News Development Studio,
    said several reasons, from changing plans to "unsafe conditions," have been given
    for the termination. The development studio orbits less than 550 kilometers from
    the site of the attack and has been the location hardest hit by the exodus of
    tenants thus far.


    "People are frightened," Kadeyn explained. "They feel this kind of thing shouldn''t
    have been allowed to happen, not again. The attack was a harsh reminder of Malkalen
    and Yulai."


    One renter, who refused to identify himself to The Scope, said he was born on
    the station and had never considered leaving it until now. "You don''t know where
    or when the next attack might be," he said.


    Analysts across Pashanai agree that this trend will reverse itself in due course
    and noted that the majority of residents are staying put, though stations will
    experience the effects of lost rental revenue for some time.'
