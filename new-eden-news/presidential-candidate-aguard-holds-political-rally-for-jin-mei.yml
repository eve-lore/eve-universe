    - Celes Aguard, Governor of the Mies system and candidate in the upcoming Gallente
    Federation presidential election, attracted a crowd numbering in the thousands
    for a political rally at the planet Chakaux in the Lirsautton system yesterday.
    Aguard spoke at length of her Jin-Mei heritage and the promise to sponsor the
    development of \"fringe worlds and minority communities,\" gaining positive reactions
    from those assembled.\n\n\"When frontier settlements starve under Caldari blockades,
    and riots and panic spreads among those who feel they are voiceless, all our leaders
    can say is 'toughen up,'\" said Aguard in her speech. \"Fear is a powerful motivator,
    but it has failed to quell the governmental apathy toward the minorities of the
    Federation.\"\n\nMany of Aguard's supporters agreed with this sentiment. \"I am
    a strong supporter for maintaining the independent cultures of groups such as
    the Jin-Mei, Mannar and Intaki,\" says Cephan Langlier, a civil rights lawyer
    in Lirsautton who attended the rally. \"I would be ecstatic to see a president
    who gives more than token support to the minority cultures of the Federation.\"\n\nGovernor
    Aguard is expected to follow her tour of the Everyshore region with several rallies
    and debates in the Essence region next month."
