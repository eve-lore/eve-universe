- body: 'Leremblompes, Essence - In a press conference today, family and friends of
    Federal Freight employee Querian Galoud have publicly called upon the FIO to release
    any information concerning Galoud''s whereabouts. A senior accounts manager with
    over 15 years at Federal Freight, Galoud was brought in by FIO agents as a "person
    of interest" during the Office''s investigation following last year''s break-in.
    "The last time I saw Querian, he was being loaded into an unmarked ground-car
    by the Black Eagles," said Galoud''s wife. "That was nearly three months ago."


    Javen Semier, a lawyer representing the Galoud family, also spoke at the press
    conference, saying, "It is a matter of public record that the FIO has found both
    the individual employees and the Federal Freight corporation as a whole innocent
    of any involvement in espionage. Mr. Galoud cooperated fully with the investigation,
    and no charges or arraignments have been made. The FIO has been singularly uncooperative
    in providing any information about Mr. Galoud''s whereabouts or condition, leading
    us to believe that Mr. Galoud remains in FIO custody and is being denied access
    to legal counsel in direct violation of Federation law."


    Shortly after the public appeal by Mr. Galoud''s family, the FIO issued the following
    statement: "Mr. Galoud was brought in for questioning and promptly released after
    his statement was taken. What happened to him after he left FIO custody is not
    a topic upon which we can speculate." When pressed by members of the media for
    further information regarding the timeline of Galoud''s custody, the FIO spokesman
    simply said, "It is not the policy of the Special Department of Internal Investigations
    to release investigative material without an Executive or Senate order."'
