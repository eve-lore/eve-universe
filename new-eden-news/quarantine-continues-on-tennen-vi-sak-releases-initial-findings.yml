- body: "Tennen \u2013 The Caldari Business Tribunal continues to enforce a quarantine
    around Tennen VI as Hyasyoda officials and experts from the School of Applied
    Knowledge investigate the disease which has ravaged the planet's crops over the
    last several weeks. Food prices on the planet itself have skyrocketed as wholesalers
    and distributors increased prices to encourage conservation, and some of the most
    perishable items have already disappeared from store shelves. \n\nLines outside
    the groceries of the planet's largest city, Muurskiota, were stretching for several
    hundred meters before doors opened yesterday morning, as residents lined up to
    restock their cupboards. Though planetary administrators say there is no danger
    of an actual food shortage, many locals are taking no chances. \u201CMy grocery
    bill has gone up almost fourfold in the last three weeks,\u201D said Rinna Piyrko,
    one of the hopeful shoppers. \u201CWith the food processing plant shut down, my
    husband and I haven't been paid in two weeks. They are telling us not to hoard,
    but who can afford to wait if the quarantine continues for another month?\u201D
    \n\nPotential food shortages aren't the only problem residents are dealing with;
    the quarantine has ended all non-essential travel to or from the planet in order
    to safeguard offworld food sources. \u201CI put in for a transfer to Kimotoro
    six months before this all started,\u201D said mechanic Jaskaa Tatimala. \u201CI've
    been waiting to move into the core systems for eight years, and I was finally
    up for an opening at a mining facility in Niyabainen, but the quarantine's screwed
    me over. I just got word last week that they'd had to take someone else to fill
    the position. How long am I going to have to wait for the next opportunity like
    that? Another decade? Come on.\u201D \n\nCaptain Roki Tarpas, commander of the
    Corporate Police Force detachment tasked with maintaining order on and around
    the planet during the crisis, told us that so far there have been no serious threats
    to public safety. \u201CI'm happy to report that despite the stress that planetary
    residents are no doubt under, we've had relatively few incidents of trouble on
    the surface. The only notable problem was last Wednesday's attack on a maglev
    cargo train by criminals intent on stealing food to sell on the black market,
    but it was easily repelled by CPF marines and all 34 perpetrators were killed
    or captured with no losses.\u201D She declined to comment on reports that the
    planetary administration had been evacuated last week, saying that such matters
    were out of her jurisdiction. \n\nMeanwhile, Hyasyoda crop scientists and researchers
    from the School of Applied Knowledge continue to analyze the blight and believe
    they are only a week or so away from developing an antiviral agent to counteract
    the disease. \u201CSo far, our team has determined that there are two separate
    strains of the virus spreading on the planet. The Tennen-A strain appears to have
    been the originator. From what we can tell it manifested in several completely
    geographically distinct areas at once, acting on key gene sequences unique to
    a small number of hybrids,\u201D said Dr. Eitar Hayona, the horticultural epidemiologist
    in charge of the SAK's team on the planet. \u201CThe Tennen-B strain appears to
    be a mutation, originating in the eastern part of the planet's smaller continent,
    and is at least five times more virulent than the A strain. In the lab, it shows
    the potential to spread to almost any grains and even some other loosely related
    plants. Containing the A strain was a relatively simple task, but the B strain
    is proving far more resistant.\u201D \n\nInsiders at Hyasyoda Corporation headquarters
    in Suroken say the corporation's legal department is already drafting charges
    to file with the Tribunal, anticipating that CPF forensic scientists will be able
    to determine the source of the blight in short order. However, according to Dr.
    Hayona, if it is in fact engineered, that may not be as easy as one might think.
    \u201CThere's literally dozens of entities who could have pulled this off, both
    inside and outside the State,\u201D she said. \u201CEvery single one of them would
    be very careful to hide their tracks, especially when the Tennen-B strain looks
    to have gotten out of hand. It could take months, even years of research to narrow
    down the list of suspects.\u201D"
