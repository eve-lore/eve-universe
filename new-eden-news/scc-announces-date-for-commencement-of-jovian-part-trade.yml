    on the upcoming Jovian body part trade has been extended until Wednesday of next
    week.   \n  \nAccording to the statement, issued on behalf of Commission CFO Rayla
    Netho, the setting of the new date is due to the \u201Clogistical problems inherent
    in an undertaking of this size. There is no precedent for this kind of market
    venture, and extreme caution needs to be exercised in order to protect economic
    stability.\u201D   \n  \nThe statement also contains details on SCC-proposed changes
    to the buy-back proceedings. In order to facilitate participation from a larger
    number of individuals, the minimum order size for each part will be reduced from
    the previously-planned 1000 units to more manageable sums, corresponding to each
    part\u2019s relative rarity.   \n  \nMore details will be released once the SCC
    has finalized the arrangements."
