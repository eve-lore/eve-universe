    Drifters Attack Zarzakh Gate Systems\nDrifters have launched an all-out attack
    on the four systems that contain stargates to Zarzakh. Zarzakh is a unique solar
    system in close proximity to a black hole, currently occupied by the Deathless
    Circle. It is only accessible via ancient Jovian gates which are located in four
    systems in distant reaches of New Eden. These systems are Turnur, Alsavoinon,
    H-PA29, and G-0Q86. Roaming Drifters have been detected in these gate systems
    along with Sleeper drones under their control.\n\nAs the attack began, deep space
    telemetry detected a massive warping of spacetime around Zarzakh itself. This
    warping has created a boundary through which no events can be observed. It is
    functionally the same as the event horizon around a black hole, except that selected
    energy and matter seem to be able to pass through it unimpeded. Reports out of
    Zarzakh have confirmed that there has been no change inside the system itself,
    or with the black hole present there. \n\nThe Scope has reached out to the Society
    of Conscious Thought for insights into the ongoing events. SOCT CEO Idmei Sver
    has informed us that, \u201CWe are in the early days of trying to understand this
    new phenomenon. This is the first observed case of what we are dubbing a \u2018Selective
    Hyperdimensional Event Horizon\u2019 and at this point, its exact nature and origins
    remain unclear.\u201D\n\nIn the gate systems, Drifters have attempted to activate
    stargates linked with Zarzakh. While these gates are still functional, the Drifter
    attempts have failed. This is the first time Drifters have been detected interacting
    with stargates. Idmei Sver has explained, \u201CThis is an indication that the
    Drifters are unable to use their typical wormhole transits to travel beyond the
    Horizon into Zarzakh. It is beyond doubt that Zarzakh itself is the Drifters'
    true target.\u201D\n\nDrifter forces in the besieged gate systems have deployed
    never-before-seen structures that are generating incredibly powerful spacetime-warping
    fields. SOCT telemetry indicates that these fields are attempting to disrupt,
    and ultimately breach, the Horizon. Designated as Horizon Breach Engines, the
    structures are under the control of a single Drifter, Tyrannos Tekton. \u201CWhat
    we are witnessing,\u201D Sver qualified \u201Cis a hyperspace siege.\u201D\n\nCapsuleers
    approaching the locations where engines have been deployed, called Horizon Siege
    Points, have received communications from one Malaya Hrada. Malaya Hrada is the
    caravanmaster of the Hrada-Oki, a Deathless Circle allied Thukker caravan. She
    appears to be hunkered down inside the Fulcrum along with many other Deathless
    operatives and is offering rewards to any capsuleers willing to disrupt the Drifters'
    efforts.\n\n![Drifter Faces](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/3Umz6mabCZC65ae7gIyQRm/d8aa9c674ab13af9ceffec27f283d394/Drifter_Faces.png)\n###
    The Drifters: Silent Tyrants\nThis attack, which began today on the 9th of September
    YC126, takes place over nine years since the Drifters first emerged in New Eden.
    While this siege is the first time there has been any sign of Drifter interest
    in Zarzakh, it is not the first time they have been connected with Jovian sites.
    In addition to the Jovian gates which provide its stargate connections, Zarzakh
    is home to the Fulcrum. The Fulcrum is a massive station of ancient Jovian design
    currently occupied by the Deathless Circle. \n\nThe Drifters have shown great
    interest in Jovian Observatories, large structures whose reveal coincided with
    the Drifter emergence. The Drifters have also been connected with the Sleepers,
    an offshoot of the Second Jovian Empire that once called wormhole space its home.
    Drifters have been observed raiding Sleeper infrastructure left behind from an
    era prior to their exodus to wormhole space.\n\nWhile all attempts to communicate
    with the Drifters have failed, data tags on Drifter vessels have revealed the
    names of some Drifter pilots, all of which include the word \u201CTyrannos\u201D.
    They are also tagged as being part of a single organization; the Vigilant Tyrannos.
    The name implies a connection to the Tyrant enclave established by Miko Bour,
    the First Tyrant, which ruled over the second Jovian Empire. Drifters are extremely
    hostile and should be approached with caution.\n\n![Emenation Locked Gate](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/4r4WLLiFrqQDFFTaySR9qI/fdc6af2decc1c34d0e0f02c4d2e5c929/Emenation_Locked_Gate.png)\n###
    Emanation Lock Appears in Zarzakh\nA source inside the Fulcrum has confirmed that
    its deep systems activated as the Horizon came into effect, causing speculation
    that the Fulcrum itself is its cause. \n\nAt the same moment that the Horizon
    appeared, changes were observed in the behavior of the stargates inside Zarzakh.
    An effect identified as the \u201CEmanation Lock\u201D is being experienced by
    those who travel to Zarzakh. After entering Zarzakh, stargates now only allow
    exit back into the system from which a traveler originated. All other transits
    are barred by the Horizon. \n\nThe current leading hypothesis is that this is
    an automated security response, protecting the system from any unchecked traffic.
    Early reports indicate that the Emanation Lock degrades over time and its effects
    are expected to end after six hours in the system, at which point the traveler
    is \u201Cnaturalized\u201D as a legitimate Zarzakh occupant and is once again
    free to exit through any gate.\n\nThe same sources have reported that the lock
    has thrown traffic through the system into chaos. This suggests that Deathless
    Circle operatives were as surprised by the appearance of the Emanation Lock as
    the rest of New Eden.\n\n### News In Brief\n\n- CONCORD responds to Zarzakh Siege,
    \u201Cas these attacks are targeting an illegal organization outside of CONCORD\u2019s
    remit, no intervention is currently planned. We will however continue to monitor
    the situation as it unfolds.\u201D\n\n- SOCT observations indicate a reduction
    in energy signatures detected within Abyssal Deadspace, indicating a cessation
    in Deepflow conflict.\n\n- Deepflow rifts are expected to disappear in a matter
    of days as the Abyss stabilizes.\n\n- In the region of Pochven, Fraternity have
    destroyed an irreplaceable Astrahus belonging to Deepwater Hooligans.\n\n- The
    Angel Cartel and their supporters have spread corruption into the system of Eredan,
    making the trade route between Amarr and Jita exceedingly dangerous. Capsuleers
    are advised to proceed with caution.\n\n- Empress summons Amarr holders following
    failure to protect vital trade routes from insurgents.\n"
