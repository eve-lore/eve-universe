- body: "Preliminary findings in the independent investigation on the blueprint theft
    from the Crielere research facility, recently initiated by Gallente President
    Foiritan, strongly indicate that personnel at the very top may be involved. While
    no names have been mentioned, it is believed that the theft was no outside job
    or petty theft by a disgruntled employee, as some have suggested, but rather an
    elaborate and deliberate act intended to personally enrich some of the leaders
    of the research project.  \n  \nThe investigation has been somewhat hampered by
    sudden resignation of the some of the people implicated in the investigation.
    At least two senior researchers have gone into early retirement, while several
    others have handed in their resignations and gone to work for research laboratories
    elsewhere. Despite these temporary setbacks the investigators have acquired some
    strong evidence that lead to the top and many are now anxiously waiting their
    final report, due any day now, which may very well have such drastic implications
    as to threaten even the future of the Crielere research program."
