- body: "![](http://www.eve-mercury.net/images/mercurybanner.png)  \n  \nPator - The
    Minmatar Republic will not ask the Thukker tribe to release the apprehended fugitive
    crime lord Baliggan Krullefor. This decision was reached in a special meeting
    yesterday between the Republic's most senior judges and several members of Sanmatar
    Shakor's government.\n\nThe emergency session was held in response to an announcement
    from Thukker Mix claiming their refusal to extradite Krullefor to Republic authorities.
    Following the conclusion of the meeting, representatives of this assembly declared
    that the Thukker demands for Krullefor would not be challenged by the Republic.\n\nPublic
    reaction to the announcement has been mixed. \"It's a shame to see tribal relations
    deteriorate like this,\" says Yuce Velkhamme, a Vherokior merchant on Matar.\n\nIn
    Molden Heath, where the Krullefor Family was based, there are others eager to
    comment on the fate of Baliggan Krullefor. Magellek Fruterol, a miner in the Weld
    system, said, \"It's an outrage. A man who has done so much evil in the Republic
    will not rot in our jail.\"\n\n\"I don't trust the Thukkers for a second, said
    Gothi Hurjafren, a clerk in the Skarkon system. \"I wouldn't be surprised if the
    Thukkers organized the whole thing.\"\n\nThukker Mix stated that Krullefor will
    serve time for his offenses under Thukker tribal law, and that his 19 years in
    Republic prison will be taken into account in his sentencing."
