    Sarikusa, leader of the notorious Blood Raider Covenant, claimed responsibility
    for the kidnapping of Eckarine Mitumi-Hnolku, wife of outlaw scientist Ullia Hnolku.
    Accompanying the message were images of a woman, later confirmed by State sources
    as Mrs. Hnolku, being subjected to \u201Cblooding\u201D \u2013 the ritual draining
    of blood which constitutes a focal point of the Covenant\u2019s highly controversial
    religious practices.   \n  \nFurthermore, Sarikusa stated that the Blood Raiders
    were \u201Cnow in control of the Insorum prototype, and more than willing to use
    it to strike at the heart of our enemy. The Empire\u2019s infidels will cower
    in their palaces tonight, for their foundations are about to be shaken. It is
    time for the fall of Amarr.\u201D   \n  \nThe news has caused massive unrest on
    Amarr Prime, with businesses and institutions closing down all over the planet
    and Holders recalling outsourced and subcontracted slave labor. Dam-Torsad has
    reported the largest gridlock in the city\u2019s history, and the planet\u2019s
    sub-orbital air force is reportedly working with Navy forces in securing airspace
    above all major metropolitan areas and labor colonies.   \n  \nOthers, meanwhile,
    are not so certain that the threat claimed by the Covenant is real. Caldari State
    officials have declared that \u201Cno conclusive evidence has yet arrived from
    the Executive Panel\u2019s investigation that would indicate that the drug has
    the effects described by the doctor or his supporters. Furthermore, to create
    any mass-distributable form of this drug would require cutting-edge scientific
    minds, the likes of which we are confident can only be found in a few places in
    the universe. We sincerely doubt the Blood Raider Covenant has access to any such
    individuals.\u201D   \n  \nWhen asked of the possibility that Mrs. Hnolku could
    have been carrying a possible second copy of the Insorum prototype, Zainou Biotech
    officials have given the answer that theoretically, the drug may have been replicated
    before the two scientists eloped from Zainou headquarters in Isseras. They added
    that while no evidence could be found of such a replication having taken place,
    the possibility could not be discounted.   \n  \nDr. Ullia Hnolku remains at large.
    He is known to be in negotiations with several capsuleer parties via GalNet, a
    [communications thread](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=180264)
    played and replayed by feedsites the world over in the past week.   \n  \nMore
    news on the situation as it develops."
