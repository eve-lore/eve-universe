    Executive Panel) and [Caldari Navy](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari
    Navy) have announced that, as part of their continued investigation into the events
    surrounding the Invasion of [Caldari Prime](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari
    Prime), [Ishukone Corporation](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Ishukone Corporation)
    and subsidiary [Zainou Biotech](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Zainou) will
    retrieve and investigate the wreckage of the Shiigeru.


    The largest piece of wreckage, 700 kilometers outside of Arcurio, has mostly been
    untouched since the forward section crashed into the planet following its destruction
    in orbit. Experts say that the wreckage remains unstable as the tritanium alloy
    which makes up its superstructure continually reacts with the oxygen atmosphere
    and loses stability, putting any attempts at cleanup years - if not decades -
    down the line.


    The CEP, however, stated, "Telemetry data from the flight recorder is a vital
    part of our ongoing investigation into the events of March 22nd. It must be recovered
    in order to proceed."


    Ishukone and Zainou engineers will work under the oversight of Mordu''s Legion
    to recover the recorder, along with other components from the wreck which may
    prove useful. Ishukone has stated that it will exercise "extreme caution" in approaching
    the wreck, as "any unnecessary disturbance could cause the power core or doomsday
    device to explode."'
