- body: "Head of Minmatar Republic Parliament Malaetu Shakor in an interview last
    night stated that the Khumaak, an ornamental weapon worn at diplomatic gatherings
    by Matari dignitaries and fleet officers but restricted from view at certain functions
    due to recently-passed legislation, had gone from being fairly commonplace to
    being almost mandatory.  \n  \nShakor, interviewed by the Defiant Descendants\u2019
    Society, an organization of Minmatars afflicted by an eye disease causing blindness
    early in life (a condition which the Parliament leader himself suffers from),
    also said, with regards to the weapon, \u201CIt\u2019s everywhere now. Every international
    function -- military meeting, trade summit, CONCORD assembly, embassy reception,
    whatever -- if there\u2019s a son or daughter of Matar present, there\u2019ll
    be a Khumaak strapped across their back.\u201D   \n  \nThe weapon, a bronze-plated
    club with curved spikes radiating from a disc set on one end, became the subject
    of a large-scale dispute among the Minmatar tribes almost two months ago, when
    Sebiestor tribal head Karin Midular put forth a motion to have it removed from
    the list of sanctioned Matari fleet and state apparel due to its nature as a symbol
    of bloodshed. After nearly a month of fierce debates, protests and rioting, the
    tribes agreed upon a modified proposal intended to limit the Khumaak\u2019s visibility
    at selected functions, while allowing it to remain on the list of sanctioned apparel.
    \  \n  \nWhat has emerged in the time since then, however, is not a stream of
    Khumaak-less Matari representatives, but rather a stream of Matari representatives
    with covered-up Khumaaks. Since the proposal\u2019s final draft specified not
    that the Khumaak should be absent but merely that it could not be openly displayed,
    an overwhelming majority of dignitaries and fleet commanders -- many of which
    had never worn the weapon before the proposal -- now carry their Khumaaks, swathed
    in thick black cloth, to functions where they are nominally to be barred from
    view.   \n  \nShakor himself, long noted for his penchant towards subtle defiance
    of the Amarr, has carried a covered-up Khumaak to every function he has attended
    since the motion\u2019s passing. Last week, in what has become a famous incident,
    at a trans-empire summit with Amarr Emperor Kor-Azor in attendance, Shakor\u2019s
    cloth covering slipped off the weapon\u2019s top as he bowed before the emperor,
    revealing the jagged solar flares of the Khumaak\u2019s disc. For the next moments,
    as Shakor and the discernibly flustered Emperor exchanged words, the Khumaak\u2019s
    disc remained in full view.   \n  \nQuestioned by reporters after the incident,
    Shakor responded, \u201CWhat can I say? I\u2019m blind.\u201D"
