- body: "Several Caldari feednets have in the past hour run news claiming that, according
    to information just received from inside sources at the Kaalakiota Corporation,
    the ongoing riots at Truiisu Station on Kassigainen IV are the result of \"a planned
    revolt, instigated by double agents from competing corporations.\" According to
    the information, the goal of these double agents is \"the subversion of the Kaalakiota
    work force through incitement of anti-corporate ideals.\"   \n  \nAnalysts from
    other networks have heaped scorn on the statement, calling it a \"thinly veiled
    attempt\" by the megacorporation to cast the victims of what looks like a major
    humanitarian incident in a negative light.   \n  \n\"If the general trends are
    anything to go by,\" said Nielaus Oilien, economic analyst for Citadel-1, \"then
    I think mass layoffs or grand-scale pay cuts are the likely culprits rather than
    any form of competing corporate ineterest. These allegations are frankly ludicrous.\"
    \  \n  \nThe Chief Executive Panel, meanwhile, has issued a statement claiming
    that \"Kaalakiota have been in dialogue with us ... [they] have assured us that
    the problem is under control and is being handled.\"   \n  \nLatest unconfirmed
    reports from Kassigainen IV put the current death toll at just over a hundred
    people."
