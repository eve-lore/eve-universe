- body: "An operation that has taken months of undercover work and surveillance came
    to a conclusion on Sunday evening as the Regional Drug Squad of the Federation
    Customs captured a Serpentis Carrier fully laden with the drug Rise. The drug,
    which was expected to be distributed around the region by fast interceptors and
    sympathisers, has been a scourge on the region of Placid, due to it appealing
    mainly to the Intaki population. \n\nInspector Xavier, in command of the drug
    squad, held a press conference to sing the praises of his teams' effort in tracking
    down the carrier and its cargo. Starting the conference with stating that his
    team had \u201C _dealt a crushing blow to the Serpentis Corporation\u201D_ , he
    went on to say, _\u201Cwe uncovered intelligence that Cobra Squadron of the Serpentis
    Corporation was smuggling in Rise into Placid by means of a Thanatos Class Carrier.\u201D_\n\nThe
    Inspector mobilised his fleet and went to intercept the carrier in the Dour system,
    and located it from the Cynosural Field signature. When the Federation Customs
    arrived at the point in which the carrier had jumped in, they were met by a small
    amount of resistance from the Serpentis and what the Inspector described as \u201C
    _a band of capsuleers intent on causing destruction.\u201D_\n\nAt the forefront
    of this battle was Vorada Kuvakei, the ex-Mordus Legion pilot, and now leader
    of Illoren. The Inspector explained that Illoren were a vigilante group who operate
    in Placid. Xavier dismissed the help from Kuvakei and Illoren, _\u201CKuvakei
    and Illoren seem to be more politically motivated than to help the situation.
    At all times during the investigation, Kuvakei tried to score political points,
    withheld information and evidence, and in my opinion, prolonged the operation
    rather than helping us out.\u201D_\n\nThe Placid Militia, who have taken it upon
    themselves to help keep the Region of Placid clean, were also present at the scene
    and were assisting The Federation Customs. He closed the press conference by thanking
    Gallente Federation Loyalists in Placid, _\u201CIt is pleasing to see citizens'
    stand and fight for what they know is good and true. I will be speaking with their
    leaders in the near future to arrange a formal thank-you from the Federal authorities.
    I wish every Federation citizen took as much pride in their regions as they do.\u201D_\n\nBefore
    leaving the stage he found time to make a quick joke _\u201CNot too much pride
    though, I still want a job to come to in the morning.\u201D_"
