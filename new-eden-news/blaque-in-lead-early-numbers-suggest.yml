- body: "According to early numbers just in from the Gallente Electoral Commission,
    presidential contender Mentas Blaque currently leads incumbent President Souro
    Foiritan by a five-point margin. Votes have been fully counted from 233 districts
    out of 528.   \n  \nAn interview with Senator Blaque was aired two hours ago on
    a popular Gallente feednet, wherein the Senator reaffirmed the driving points
    of his campaign.   \n  \n\u201CI think Gallenteans should be proud to call themselves
    Gallente... I, I think that there is such a focus on being open towards other
    cultures that people will... sometimes they will tend to forget that they have
    a rich and proud heritage of their own to draw on. The citizens of our great nation
    should be more aware that we are just that, a great nation,\u201D he said.   \n
    \ \nThe Senator furthermore expounded upon his platform\u2019s proposed shifts
    in focus towards what they term \u201Cdomestic naturalization,\u201D a process
    involving state-sponsored segregation of immigrant populations to areas specifically
    designated for them, referred to in the doctrine as \u201Ccultural habitats.\u201D
    \  \n  \nThe 18-minute interview has provoked mixed reactions from international
    parties. Keitan Yun, a senior representative from the Minmatar Republic\u2019s
    Ministry of Foreign Affairs, commented that the senator \u201Csounded like he
    was reading aloud from one of those old ultranationalist textbooks that have by
    now become the stuff of parody.\u201D   \n  \nLarik Saal, Amarr Ambassador to
    CONCORD, meanwhile approved vociferously of the Senator\u2019s proposals, stating
    that the Federation \u201Cis in great and dire need of a ruler capable of drawing
    the lines where they need to be drawn.\u201D   \n  \nUpdated election numbers
    will be provided as they come in."
