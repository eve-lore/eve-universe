- body: "Caldari sources are reporting scan results have exposed a heretofore unknown
    practice by Gallentean company Quafe: transporting weapons and ammunition into
    their stations in Caldari space. Hanni Isollenek, operating for the Lai Dai Protection
    corporation, uncovered shipments of \u201Cmillions of isk\u201D worth of arms
    and armaments intermingled with more mundane cargos. At the time of this writing,
    it is unknown if this marks a change in official Quafe corporate policy. \n\n\u201CScans
    show office equipment\u2014data sheets, reports, supplies\u2014which is to be
    expected. But we have also ascertained that these supply trains are carrying ammunition
    and heavy armaments, which is not only unexpected, but troubling.\u201D Isollenek
    is an operative in an \u201Cintelligence gathering arm\u201D of Lai Dai Protection.
    \n\n\u201CAny further action is a matter for the State, but we will be sharing
    our data with all interested parties,\u201D Isollenek went on to say. \u201CQuafe
    has some explaining to do.\u201D \n\nEsh Eikaan, a Caldari political analyst operating
    for an independent corporation, defends the Quafe company\u2019s alleged actions.
    \u201CIf they are transporting weapons, they are only doing what every other company
    and governmental body are doing. Everyone is preparing for these suddenly uncertain
    times. Even if the Amarr Succession and the troubles in the Minmatar Parliament
    are resolved in the best possible way, organized criminal activity and rogue corporations
    are seeing a dramatic increase in activity. Is it a cause for concern? Not for
    the Caldari State, not at this time.\u201D \n\nRepresentatives for the Quafe Company
    were unavailable for comment."
