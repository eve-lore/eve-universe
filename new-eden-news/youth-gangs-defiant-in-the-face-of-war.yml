- body: "Pator \u2013 Excitement still runs high across the Republic in the wake of
    the Elders' rescue of the survivors of Starkmanir, and the youth of Matar are
    among the most galvanized in support of the war. \n\nYouths of Brutor Tribe especially
    are commonly seen on streets and stations these days demonstrating in support
    of the war, in some cases chanting _Te'Rauhaka_ (ancient tribal songs of victory),
    or reciting some of the more fiery speeches of figures such as then-Parliament
    Head Malaetu Shakor. \n\nIdolization of newly-minted Sanmatar Shakor himself appears
    to be running at an all-time high. A number of the aforementioned youths have
    been reportedly wearing prosthetic lenses on their eyes, presumably emulating
    the blind appearance of Shakor and other descendants of the original Defiant lineage.
    \n\nWhile all indications are that such demonstrations have been peaceful, there
    are unconfirmed reports of some groups accosting individuals who do not show full
    support for the continuing warfare against the Amarr."
