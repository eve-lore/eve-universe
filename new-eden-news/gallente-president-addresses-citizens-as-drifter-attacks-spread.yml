    Wrath of Tyrannos Begins\n\nDrifter activity has intensified across New Eden as
    forces previously seen only in the five Drifter wormholes have begun to appear
    across the cluster. As the factions occupying Drifter wormhole space have kept
    up the pressure, retaliatory sites have appeared all across New Eden. \n\nTyrannos
    Strategos, leader of the Drifters' Vigilant Tyrannos, has been sighted in her
    dreadnought protecting newly appeared Hive structures at Locus Points in lowsec
    systems. These vast rings are not yet active, and Labyrinth Complexes similar
    to those observed in Drifter wormhole space have been spotted throughout higher
    security space. According to SOCT hyperspace telemetry, these Labyrinths are directing
    higher-dimensional traffic to the Hives within Locus Points as part of the Drifters'
    attempts to bring the sites online.\n\nWith higher-dimensional sites now descending
    into k-space, the factions occupying Drifter wormholes have established new trading
    posts to take advantage of objects of interest collected by capsuleers who enter
    those sites. As they are further removed from the primary occupation strongholds
    in wormhole space, exchange rates at these traders are less favorable than those
    found inside the occupied Drifter wormhole systems. Located within the capital
    systems of each faction, these trading posts are; the Amarr Anointed Allocator,
    New Caldari State Trader, Pator Liberation Quartermaster, Raravoss Kybernaut Glorification
    Xordazh, and the Yulai Secured Requisition Officer.\n\nThe four major nations
    have called on capsuleers to rally in the defense of this space against this unprecedented
    threat to K-space. The Gallente, who were unable to gain a foothold in Drifter
    wormhole space, have mounted operations against Drifters following a press conference
    held by President Celes Aguard.\n\n\u201CCitizens and friends of the Federation,
    do not allow our envious enemies to taint your perceptions with their words. While
    we may have faced some challenges in recent days, the Federation remains as resilient
    as ever, and we are committed to recovering from our setbacks. As I address you
    now, the Federation is mobilizing its defenses to counter what we hope to be a
    final assault by Drifter forces.\u201D\n\nCritics have accused the President of
    grandstanding following her failures to establish a strong research program during
    last month's \u201CRace for the Hives.\u201D A failure that resulted in the Gallente
    being the only one of the four major nations not to claim a Drifter wormhole.\n\nShortly
    after her address, Caldari State Militia gained control over the Ouperia \u201COld
    Man Star\u201D system after 3 years of Gallente occupation, leading to additional,
    mostly non-violent protests in Caille targeting President Aguard for her alleged
    incompetence.\n\n### News in Brief:\n\n- Drifters mount attacks across New Eden.\n\n
    \  - New traders have appeared in key faction capital locations.\n\n   - Pator,
    Amarr, New Caldari, Yulai, Raravoss each report new trading posts.\n\n   - A remarkably
    consistent 50% markup has been added to costs due to \u201Cthe risk of providing
    goods from dangerous locales.\u201D\n\n- There have been reports of a surge in
    visits to the monument on top of the Jita 4-4 station.\n\n- An estimated 250 billion
    ISK worth of ships were destroyed during a massive battle in the Ahbazon system."
