    Drifter Activity Dies Down\n\nCheers rang out across New Eden as news spread of
    the Drifter Crisis coming to an end. On YC127-05-15, preliminary reports indicated
    an almost complete cessation of Drifter activity in the occupied wormholes. Research
    provided by the Society of Conscious Thought yesterday shows a sudden severance
    of the connections between the Warden, the structure in Zarzakh that The Deathless
    retains sole access to, and the Drifter Nexuses. Consequently, Drifters have drawn
    back their forces. While they remain a threat to New Eden, it is widely believed
    that their resources have been greatly depleted by the Crisis.\n\nIdemi Sver,
    the Society\u2019s CEO, passionately added the following when providing the research
    data:\n\n\u201CAs we celebrate the end of a calamity that the Deathless Circle
    themselves caused, can we afford to sit back and let them continue to have unfettered
    access to what we now know is dangerous technology? Had the SOCT been in control
    of the Warden, we would have prevented the Drifter connection from having been
    established at all. Failing that, I assure you we would have resolved the issue
    in days, not weeks, and without requiring assistance from the major factions or
    capsuleers. If we are to ensure that another Crisis does not occur, The Deathless\u2019
    technological tyranny over Zarzakh must come to an end.\u201D\n\n### Tension Rise
    Over First Policy of the Drifter Summit Proposal\n\nWhen Drifter activity ceased,
    the five factions occupying Drifter wormholes, each of which successfully maintained
    control, took the opportunity to transport large Drifter structures from the Hives
    to their occupation sites. Extensive research on these structures is presumed
    to be underway.\n\nThe Society, having just revealed its own findings regarding
    the severance of the Warden connections, sent along with the data a reminder of
    the adopted EDENCOM proposal for open sharing of research.\n\nThe reminder was
    reportedly met with bristling remarks from faction leadership.\n\n- The Convocation
    of Triglav has allegedly approached Caldari and Amarr representatives directly,
    rejecting the thought of sharing information with the unproven.\n\n- The Caldari\u2019s
    Chief Executive Panel did not comment when queried but informed us that they were
    actively seeking legal counsel.\n\n- The Amarr herald waxed poetic, ending her
    lengthy sermon-esque response with a line about keeping research and knowledge
    confined to those deserving.\n\n- Minmatar and EDENCOM authorities expressed disappointment
    with the other occupying forces\u2019 sudden reticence and willingness to ignore
    the will of New Eden.\n\nAfter the first Summit proposal was swiftly shut down
    amid fears that rival factions might gain strategically valuable information,
    public confidence in the remaining two proposals surviving New Eden\u2019s harsh
    political landscape has faltered.\n\nThe NEN will continue to closely follow any
    developments regarding the Summit\u2019s policies.\n\n![Drifter Structure_Kelly

    Gallente Political Turmoil Continues\n\nAs the most populous faction not occupying
    a Drifter wormhole and therefore excluded from the Drifter Summit, the Gallente
    Federation\u2019s citizenry reacted strongly to images of Drifter structures positioned
    near Caldari military installations, sparking renewed protests aimed at President
    Celes Aguard over the potential technological advantages this may provide.\n\nProtesters
    are also expressing growing frustration over the continued absence of election
    news, particularly now that the Drifter Crisis, the official reason for the postponement,
    appears to have ended.\n\n### News in Brief\n\n- The Deepflow has become less
    volatile, according to reliable scientific sources.\n\n- Drifter Wormhole filaments
    no longer function, due to the Warden-Nexuses connection being severed.\n\n- Amarr
    and Minmatar forces exchanged blows and systems, Sosala going to the Empire and
    Vard to the Republic.\n\n- Capsuleer-run EVE University, through Project Firebird,
    begin their overhaul of their long-standing capsuleer databank.\n\n- Large groups
    of dreadnoughts and capital ships have been spotted moving from Fountain to an
    undisclosed location.\n\n<sup>_Images captured by capsuleers Walter Islands and
