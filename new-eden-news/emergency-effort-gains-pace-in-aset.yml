- body: 'Aset - The Minmatar Mining Corporation''s emergency teams are now well established
    at site of the recent mining collapse in Aset, but have yet to begin the actual
    rescue dig.


    "Our engineers are currently surveying the site and attempting to determine the
    state of the interior before we begin," reported head of emergency operations
    Kahlial Vik. "We need to ensure that our excavation does not put our rescue teams
    or any survivors in jeopardy."


    When asked whether he thought if there were any actual survivors, Khalial Vik
    responded that "The DOMUs [Deep Ore Mining Units] that the teams operate were
    very robustly designed and should keep their crews safe. I''m confident our people
    are still alive."


    Vik went on to confirm reports that the MMC''s emergency team had been recently
    joined by a contingent of Republic Fleet vessels who he said were there to assist
    in rescue operations and site security.


    The exact location of the site is being kept secret due to its sensitive location
    in the conflict zone. The Fleet has confirmed, however, that it has called upon
    the Tribal Liberation Force to assist in securing the system.'
