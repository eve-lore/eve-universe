- body: 'ELGOI - In a statement made this morning, Eifyr & Co have made an official
    response to the apparent reappearance of missing scientist Dr. Hilen Tukoss.


    Tukoss was registered as a missing person with the Republic Security Services
    more than two years ago, after vanishing during the initial setup stages of the
    Arek''Jalaan project. Former Program Director at the Otosela Neuropsychology Center
    for Zainou Biotech, Tukoss defected to the Minmatar Republic in YC113 and claimed
    political asylum before joining Eifyr & Co.


    Speaking on behalf of the corporation, and responding to public communications
    on GalNet by Tukoss in recent days, Public Relations Director Frelf Laer expressed
    her delight, saying, "The reappearance of Dr. Tukoss has allowed many of our staff
    to breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that he appears to be safe and well. At this
    time, Dr. Tukoss has not attempted to re-establish contact with Eifyr & Co, however,
    we warmly welcome him back, and hope that he will be in contact as soon as he
    has caught up on current affairs."


    Asked to comment on the unusual nature of the communciations, Director Laer would
    say only that "Eifyr specialists in encryption and expert systems are studying
    the material closely." When approached for comment, both the Republic Security
    Services and Zainou Biotech declined the opportunity to respond to the reports
    of Hilen Tukoss communicating with capsuleers.'
