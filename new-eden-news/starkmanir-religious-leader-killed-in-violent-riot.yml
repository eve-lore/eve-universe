    A Brutor Tribe-owned Minmatar refugee settlement in Abudban endured a violent
    riot last night, during which visiting Starkmanir Sage Uldas Dreeter was killed
    by anti-theists who were protesting his public services. The Brutor Tribe has
    deployed a number of riot police units to the refugee outpost and is in the process
    of relaying the different groups to segregated habitation modules.\n\nAs a cleric
    of the Amarr faith, Uldas Dreeter had been touring the Republic for several months.
    He had visited many refugee communities and was one of the most widely known religious
    figures in the Starkmanir tribe. His visit to Abudban yesterday was one of the
    last he had scheduled on his tour, after which he would have returned to his home
    on Rens III. Amarrian faithful throughout the Republic gave Dreeter a moment of
    silence out of respect for his work. \n\n\"He was one of our best bets for uniting
    the tribe,\" said Fredivar Parch, a member of Dreeter's tour staff.\n\nCulturally
    motivated violence toward Minmatar adhering to the Amarr faith continues to ravage
    refugee settlements in the region.The Brutor Tribe has stated it will only implement
    complete segregation in the most extreme cases, calling the current process \"a
    method of acclimatization.\" The Sisters of EVE have decried the statement, saying
    it implies the Republic is trying to punish or eradicate faithful Minmatar. The
    Brutor Tribe has fiercely denied this accusation, instead blaming government-defined
    guidelines on refugee processing."
