- body: "Illuin \u2013 Scope News has obtained information indicating that the armada
    which appeared in Yulai is connected to disgraced Minmatar Republic Ambassador
    Keitan Yun. The anonymous source revealed that the timing of the fleet\u2019s
    appearance coincided almost directly with an alleged threat issued by Mr. Yun
    directly to CONCORD. The sudden show of force, which included Thukker Tribe warships,
    was apparently intended to back his claims. However, the precise nature of the
    threat itself is unknown, nor is it clear on whose behalf it was made. \n\nMr.
    Yun, appointed to the post of Minmatar Ambassador to the CONCORD Assembly by Prime
    Minister Karin Midular last month, caused an uproar with his vocal confrontation
    with his Amarrian counterpart during his inaugural address. CONCORD Chief of Staff
    Kivas Odaka would only confirm that Mr. Yun has become a \"person of interest\"
    in the ongoing investigation of today\u2019s events, and that his present whereabouts
    are unknown."
