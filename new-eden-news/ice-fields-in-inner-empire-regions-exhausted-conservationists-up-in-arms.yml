    have depleted numerous Ice Fields in high-traffic, high-security Empire regions.
    Initial reports state these resources will not replenish, and other Ice Fields
    are in danger of the same fate. \n\n\"Today is a very sad day, knowing that these
    once vast stretches of natural ice and beauty are forever gone,\" said Marcalin
    Chronet, a noted champion of resource and new Capsuleer protection rights. \"How
    many more fields will suffer the same fate in order to pad the wallets of companies
    who automate the strip mining process for obscene profits? It's a shame that these
    large scale, automated mining ops went through these crucial areas and cleaned
    them out. Some new pod pilots are going to wonder where they can go to turn a
    couple ISK for expenses tonight.\" \n\nOthers spoke out against these mining conglomerates.
    Said Aidan Black, CEO of Serenity Search, Salvage and Storage, \"Hopefully, this
    loss of natural resources will have an impact on how these operations run. Maybe
    now, they will have to go into less-secure areas where they have to compete with
    Capsuleers who are at the controls of their mining AND weapon systems. Time will
    tell.\" \n\nAttempts were made to contact a number of strip mining conglomerate
    officers and CEOs. None could be reached for comment."
