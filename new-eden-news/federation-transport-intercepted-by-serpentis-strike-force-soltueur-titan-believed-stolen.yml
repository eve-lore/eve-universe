- body: "This just in: a Federation cargo transport passing through the Alperaute
    system was three hours ago intercepted by what is believed to have been a Serpentis
    strike force of unknown size and make-up. Preliminary reports indicate losses
    on the Gallente side were significant: in addition to dozens of frigates and a
    number of cruisers and battleships, the Federation is said to have lost control
    of one of its six Soulteur titans into the hands of the Serpentis.   \n  \nFederation
    officials have at this point neither confirmed nor denied the titan's loss, but
    are admitting the brutal attack \"came as a complete shock, seemingly out of nowhere.\"
    Salvage and rescue teams have been at work in the system for the past two hours,
    and the exact nature and number of Federation losses is expected to come in soon.
    More updates as they arrive."
