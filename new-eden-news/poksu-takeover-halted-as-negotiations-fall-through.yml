    - After announcing their takeover of Material Acquisition's operations in the
    Uphallant system last week, The Poksu Mineral Group has put the entire project
    on hold. The reversal in position stems from a contract dispute between Poksu
    and partner Nugoeihuvi.\n\nOriginally, Nugoeihuvi was contracted to provide logistical
    support to Poksu from its stations in the Uphallant system. However, disagreements
    between Nugoeihuvi and Sukuuvestaa (which owns the controlling interest in Poksu)
    over which corporation's paramilitary forces (Internal Security and the Peace
    and Order Unit, respectively) would have jurisdiction led to Nugoeihuvi withdrawing
    support for the project.\n\nIn light of a lack of in-system support and increased
    Federal Defence Union activity in the area, Poksu opted to shelve the project.
    While Poksu press releases stated that the company is still interested in pursuing
    the matter, it is unclear what concessions would be required to bring Nugoeihuvi
    back on board."
