- body: "Imber Raskullinen, former employee of Urban Management, has been arrested
    and charged with espionage.\n\nRaskullinen had been working on a project that
    assisted vulnerable persons in the Republic. Although exact details of her crimes
    have been kept secret from the public, it is believed she processed housing applications
    for homeless citizens. Working from their Headquarters on Abudban X - Moon 10,
    she was responsible for keeping the database complete on displaced citizens; many
    of whom were former slaves or refugees.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s the lowest of the low.
    I\u2019m disgusted that a fellow Matari who was working on such a sensitive project
    could allow herself to be subjugated by a hostile intelligence agency,\u201D remarked
    Hattu Kinrad, a former colleague. \u201CI\u2019m prevented by law from giving
    out specific information, but it seems she was informing the Amarrians about passenger
    ship movements. It doesn\u2019t take the brains of a Luminaire Divorce Lawyer
    to work out what the Amarrians could do with that kind of data.\u201D\n\nUrban
    Management refused to disclose any more details. \u201CIt\u2019s true that a former
    employee is now in custody awaiting trial on charges of espionage. Beyond that,
    I cannot give you any more information. The investigation is ongoing and we have
    a duty to safeguard the operatives who are still working on this, and related
    cases.\u201D"
