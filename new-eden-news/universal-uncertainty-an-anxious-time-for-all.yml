- body: "With the next Amarr Emperor undecided and political turmoil in the Minmatar
    Parliament, apprehension is widespread and speculation about impending war is
    at an all-time high. Fears of a renewal of hostilities between the Amarr and Minmatar,
    and any effect said hostilities would have over relations between the Gallente
    Federation and Caldari State, are causing a chilling effect in the market. While
    industrialists reexamine production projections with an eye to supplying any such
    outbreak of hostilities, commodity traders look to divest themselves of any holdings
    across political divisions, and tourism and non-business travel between the empires
    is plummeting. \n\nThe effects extend to official governmental industry as well.
    Ivowik Huneimina, a representative of Republic Fleet, confirmed reports of production
    changes. \u201CWe\u2019ve been told to conserve resources and curtail production
    of wreathe- and hoarder-class industrials.\u201D When asked for interpretation
    of these orders, Huneimina said, \u201CMammoth-class vessels were originally designed
    as war-time freighters, with shielding and armor far superior to either the wreathe-class
    or hoarder-class ships. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say someone at headquarters
    is thinking we might need more freighters capable of sustaining hostile fire in
    the near future. Doesn\u2019t seem that far-fetched to me.\u201D \n\nNews from
    within Amarr space is similar: non-Heir production enterprises are issuing statements
    indicating projected manufacturing figures can no longer be relied upon as accurate.
    Amarr business enterprises contacted for this story did not reply by press time,
    but a Caldari citizen, calling himself a \u201Csupplier\u201D and speaking on
    condition of anonymity, substantiated claims that all non-royal houses have been
    instructed by their governing bodies to begin stockpiling resources and commodities.
    \u201CThe official documents say \u2018for any unforeseen circumstances of a dire
    nature,\u2019 which is pretty transparent.\u201D the Caldari source said. Such
    language, he claims, is thinly-veiled code alluding to possible full-scale war.
    Production plans of the Five Heir families are not public knowledge. \n\nJera
    Littornau of the Garound Investment Bank confirmed that long-term business loan
    applications had fallen to new lows. \u201CWe\u2019re seeing a marked decline,
    and it\u2019s obviously related to the difficulties in the Republic Parliament
    and the uncertainty over the next Amarr Emperor.\u201D Littornau is a loan officer
    for the GIB. \u201CSome of these business ventures\u2014mostly Gallentean and
    Minmatar, of course\u2014have been around for more than eighty years. They commonly
    use our loans to fund production and research. A dramatic decrease in the number
    of loan applications indicates a dramatic decrease in active production and scientific
    work. This is bad for everyone.\u201D \n\n\u201CIf it\u2019s war, we will get
    drawn into it, there\u2019s no doubt about it,\u201D said Baus Balenne, a production
    manager for Astral Mining at an outpost owned by that company in Agaullores. \u201CLook
    at the situation\u2014two, possibly three of the Five Heirs would welcome war
    with the Minmatar. Again, two or three of the major Minmatar tribal houses are
    calling for the replacement of Prime Minister Midular. So that\u2019s roughly
    a forty to sixty percent chance of war, even without increased raids on either
    side?\u201D Balenne went on to say, \u201CThe Federation has always been a staunch
    ally of the Minmatar Republic\u2014we would have no choice but to aid our friends.\u201D
    \n\n\u201COur local business is falling off, and our supplies are dwindling,\u201D
    said Myenitte Alpymyr, a sales manager for the Gallentean Aliastra Corporation.
    \u201CThis is both because of changes at head office and because of difficulties
    in the supply system.\u201D Alpymyr is stationed at the Aliastra Retail Center
    in the Minmatar system of Anher, Barvigrard Constellation, and feels this is a
    telling detail in the reduction of revenue in recent days. \u201CIf this office
    were in Federation space, I\u2019d expect sales to be off a little\u2014the economy
    is slowing right now. But what we\u2019re seeing is a direct result of being a
    Gallentean business in Minmatar space. Minmatar business concerns don\u2019t want
    to issue purchase orders for goods or services that they expect might be disrupted
    by increased military action or raids by the Amarr. Amarr raids might seem like
    ancient history to a lot of people, but in this part of the universe, memories
    are long. And vivid.\u201D \n\n\u201CIt goes beyond business slowing down,\u201D
    said Erold Albimer, a booking officer for The Leisure Group, a Minmatar corporation.
    \u201CPeople are anxious. I wouldn\u2019t say frightened would be the right word.
    Look, a lot of Minmatar would welcome the chance to free our brothers still enslaved
    by the Amarri. Many more think reparations are not only due to us, but that we\u2019ll
    have to take them by force.\u201D When questioned as to his own beliefs, Albimer
    said, \u201CAs a representative of The Leisure Group family of businesses, I\u2019m
    afraid I have to be a little more discrete than perhaps I\u2019d like to be. But
    I don\u2019t think my employers would object to my stating the obvious: people
    are tense. Everyone you talk to has the same questions\u2014do you think it will
    mean war? How long do you think before fighting breaks out?\u201D \n\nMost political
    analysts agree that the frayed nerves are not unreasonable. In what is arguable
    the most politically unsettled climate in over a hundred years, business and personal
    decisions no longer seem as easy as they might have just weeks ago. And in all
    of this, the Jove Empire remains silent and aloof, with rumored sightings of Jovian
    expeditionary vessels and Jovian scientific drones adding to the mystery. \n\nOne
    thing is certain: with the future face of both the Amarr and Minmatar ruling elite
    still deep in shadow, very real possibilities exist that could lead to decreasing
    diplomacy between the two empires\u2014possibly even war."
