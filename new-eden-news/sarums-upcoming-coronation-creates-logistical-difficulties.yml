- body: "Amarr Prime - Despite being planned for several months, Jamyl Sarum's impending
    coronation is placing heavy burdens on Amarr Prime.  \n  \nTraffic is steadily
    increasing around the system as numerous Holders from across the Empire, accompanied
    by their families and personal retinues, arrive to pay homage to the new Empress.
    Each of the Heirs also has a congregation numbering in the thousands attending
    the coronation.\n\nIn addition to those attending the coronation, huge numbers
    of freighters and industrials are arriving to supply the ceremony. Many of the
    supplies are perishable, meaning they could not be delivered earlier. Compounding
    the issues are the large number of servants, migrant workers, and slaves temporarily
    relocating to Amarr Prime to handle the visitors.  \n  \nOfficials are scrambling
    to find suitable housing for everyone involved, including those Holders who do
    not own residences in the system. Many residents have had  their domiciles appropriated,
    and other commoners are being moved to hastily erected temporary habitation compounds.
    \ \n  \nDespite the hectic nature of the proceedings, Amarrian officials are positive
    the coronation ceremony itself will go off without a hitch."
