- body: 'Speaking from his home in Caille, Julien Sirrok, the famed deep space explorer
    and expert on astronomical anomalies, warned the CreoDron wormhole exploration
    team on the over-reliance of scout drones.


    "I would suggest that Professor Burreau be extremely cautious in her assessment
    of scout drone telemetry," said Sirrok. "The data can be misleading even in relatively
    well-understood local space. If she is right and the explored system is in another
    galaxy, then it is quite possible that conditions local to that space are unusual
    to say the least."


    The explorer - who is perhaps most famous for bringing two-thirds of his crew
    back alive from the ill-fated "Cord of the Elements Expedition" a decade ago -
    continued. "An expedition into an entirely new region of space in this galaxy
    would take weeks, if not months, to prepare for. I realize the events at Seyllin
    give urgency to this effort, but they''ve got to take care, or none of them will
    come back alive."'
