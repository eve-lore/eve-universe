- body: "In a statement sent out earlier today the Secure Commerce Committee (SCC)
    announces that the cost for creating a new corporation will be increased to 1,500,000
    isk in the very near future. The CEO of SCC, Laurene Afrostel, explains that SCC
    handles the paperwork for corporations and is getting swamped by the amount of
    small, insignificant corporations out there today. By upping the cost to found
    a corporation, SCC hopes to limit the number of new corporations being formed
    every day from the flood it currently is to a more manageable number.  \n  \nResponses
    to the statement have been mixed, with the Amarrian Imperial Chancellor praising
    the decision, stating it will ensure that SCC will be able to maintain their high
    level of professionalism in the future; while the Caldari State has denounced
    the decision as \u2018ridiculous\u2019 and a direct affront to established Caldari
    business practices, which favors a rapid ebb and flow of new corporations. Sources
    within the Chief Executive Panel indicate that the Caldari leaders are considering
    taking this matter up in the halls of CONCORD, which might jeopardize the delicate
    balance currently held there between the Caldari State and the Gallente Federation."
