    of the Heideran legacy\u201D, the soon-to-be crowned Doriam Kor-Azor today ordered
    the release of thousands of imprisoned Minmatar slaves, POW\u2019s, and even some
    MIA\u2019s unaccounted for by the Minmatar Republic for decades. \u201CThe power
    bestowed to me bears a greater responsibility that extends beyond Amarr\u2019s
    borders,\u201D read a statement released by Kor-Azor\u2019s representatives. \u201CThe
    passions of mankind are shared by all of the races; history will one day show
    that the reign of Kor-Azor united the peoples of our great galaxy under the banner
    of humanity and goodwill.\u201D  \n\n\nEven as joyous Minmatar families await
    contact from Amarr authorities detailing the transport arrangements for their
    loved ones, many remain bitterly skeptical. \u201CPosturing\u201D, muttered Timona
    Shendo of the Brutor Tribal Council. \u201CPure political posturing nonsense.
    I pity the fool who thinks otherwise.\u201D Asked if the new Emperor should at
    least be given the benefit of the doubt, he answered \u201CLet me give you some
    \u2018doubt\u2019 of your own. Tell me, how many children are among the names
    of the released? None. How many of them are actually in good health? Zero. The
    sickening truth to all of this is that these people being returned to us have
    either outlived their usefulness to the Empire or are otherwise unfit for \u2018service\u2019.\u201D
    The man\u2019s hands rolled into fists, and the cracks of his knuckles were audible
    over the vidcomm. \u201CIt\u2019s all a deceitful travesty. My hatred of the Amarr
    is just as strong as it has ever been. Nothing less than the unconditional release
    of every single Minmatar will change that.\u201D  \n\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s a step
    in the right direction,\u201D stated political analyst Kedrick Liamsen. \u201CKor-Azor
    has to establish his rule immediately, and this action is certainly inline with
    expectations. He must believe that the benefits of appeasing both the moderates
    in his own empire and foreign heads of state outweigh the dangers of angering
    the fundamentalist hardliners of Amarr, most notably those aligned with Jamyl
    Sarum.\u201D  \n\n\nLady Sarum--by far the most hard line Succession Trial candidate--has
    remained silent since Kor-Azor was named Emperor, and all eyes are on her to see
    if she follows through with tradition and takes her own life. Reports are circulating
    about an increased warship presence in the vicinity of Sarum-held territories,
    and that the security measures implemented at her various palaces are unprecedented.
    Having once served as War Minister and Commander of the Imperial Fleet, Sarum
    has enormous influence with the Amarr military and is not considered likely to
    \u201Cjust go quietly into the night\u201D. Liamsen explains: \u201CShe\u2019s
    almost considered more dangerous now by the other governments than she ever was.
    For all but the Minmatar Republic, a stable, predictable Amarr Empire is the best
    they could hope for. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve been completely silent during
    the trials. They fear, above all else, a power struggle.\u201D  \n\n\n\u201CThe
    danger lies in the difference between now and the Heideran days--when she held
    the highest and most prestigious military positions possible within the Amarr
    Empire versus now, when tradition demands that she ends her life. Consider the
    implications: Beware the general with absolutely nothing left to lose. This is
    a person who has relentlessly dedicated her life to what she believes is the divine
    might of Amarr. A betrayal of sorts has occurred here. It is the ultimate test
    of her faith, which up until now was uncontested. Her actions, whatever they turn
    out to be, will affect the very essence of Amarr culture. Kor-Azor may be Emperor,
    but it is Sarum who holds the most power--at least for now.\u201D"
