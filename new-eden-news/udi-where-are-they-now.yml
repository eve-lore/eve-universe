    Gallentean dignitaries and entertainment industry personnel were slaughtered.
    This incident, one of the worst terrorist atrocities in living memory, was the
    handiwork of the UDI (United against Decadence and Impurity), a group who has
    claimed responsibility for countless terrorist incidents in Federation space over
    recent years.   \n  \nEver since the attack in Elarel, President Foiritan has
    waged war on their activities, a war which he seemed to be winning with the capture
    of the suspected orchestrator of the attacks, one Goran Mitelek.   \n  \nTry as
    he might, however, Foiritan couldn\u2019t hold onto him. Mitelek was extradited
    to the Amarr Empire to face separate charges, much to the displeasure of the outraged
    Federation population, 87% of whom wanted him prosecuted for his crimes.   \n
    \ \nHis extradition should have been the end of it, but an attack on the prison
    convoy escorting him has left a lot of questions unanswered. How did it happen,
    what exactly transpired, but perhaps most importantly, \u201CIs Goran Mitelek
    dead\u201D? The only thing recovered from the wreck of the prison transport ship
    was unidentifiable biomass, which could have come from any one of the hundreds
    of personnel on that ship. Only a fraction could be positively identified.   \n
    \ \nScattered security camera footage from the ship showed what appeared to be
    an Amarr Navy officer attacking another officer in the corridors of the ship barely
    a few minutes before the ship succumbed to enemy fire. The Navy has fiercely denied
    this, saying that the footage is misleading as the ship was shaking heavily under
    enemy fire at the time.   \n  \nWhat is most curious about this whole series of
    events is that since that attack the UDI appear to have gone underground, their
    activities all but halted. The Federation Navy claims that this is due to their
    actions in rooting out the terrorists, cutting their supplies and making it harder
    for them to operate. Regardless of whether this is true or not, many doubt that
    the UDI is truly gone. One prominent citizen was last week quoted as saying \u201CI\u2019m
    not sure whether I like this more than back when their acts were commonplace.
    Nowadays I find myself looking over my shoulder wondering where they are hiding,
    or if one of my loved ones is their next victim\u201D. Clearly, a year after they
    achieved notoriety, the UDI's name still carries an image of fear."
