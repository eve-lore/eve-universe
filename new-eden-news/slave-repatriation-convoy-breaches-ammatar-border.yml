- body: 'DOMAIN - Yesterday evening a large convoy escorted by armed capsuleer forces
    crossed the border from the Minmatar Republic to Ammatar Mandate with the purpose
    of liberating slaves.


    While initially reluctant to release further information, the Ammatar Fleet has
    confirmed that nine Fenrir class freighters belonging to Freedom Extension --
    the Minmatar Republic''s largest commercial logistics corporation -- breached
    the Ammatar border through the system of Jark, disguised as a civilian convoy.


    Accompanied by an armed escort of Electus Matari vessels, the convoy then crossed
    back into the Republic after docking in the Ammatar system of Sasta, two jumps
    from the border. It is believed at this time that the convoy took on an estimated
    1.325 million slaves before handing them back to a representative of Electus Matari
    after safe transport back into the Republic.


    In an address to the interstellar press, a spokeswoman for the Ardishapur Family
    stated outright that "this kind of barbaric behavior and lack of political etiquette
    is typical from the Republic, and shows a blatant lack of respect for the Ammatar
    authorities." She continued, adding that "border forces protecting the Mandate
    from the threat of Republic incursion will be bolstered, and any attempt at breach
    of sovereignty from here onwards will be met with application of full lethal force."


    The press offices for both Freedom Extension and the Republic Parliament remain
    unavailable for comment, with rumor from sources within the Republic Government
    indicating that Sanmatar Shakor himself has expressed his jubilation at the outcome
    of the operation.'
