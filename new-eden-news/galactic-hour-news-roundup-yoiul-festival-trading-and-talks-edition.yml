    news from all across New Eden as the Yoiul Festival period witnesses accelerated
    trading and renewed efforts at peace as the start of YC122 approaches.\n\n**PKN
    Interstellar Declares Launch of HyperNet Relay \"Successful Beyond All Projections\"**\n\nJita,
    The Forge - The PKN Interstellar consortium has issued a glowing report on the
    first 48 hours of market activity on their newly-launched HyperNet Relay trading
    and communciations network, hailing the launch as \"successful beyond all projections.\"
    While detailed financials are not available, the consortium - led by the CBD,
    Lai Dai and NOH megacorporations - has confirmed that transactions on the new
    network are \"well into the multiple trillions of ISK after only 48 hours of operation.\"\n\nPKN
    Interstellar has also noted that the high activity has allowed it to accelerate
    its associated FTL communications operations as the influx of Quantum-Entangled
    4-Helium HyperCores allows it to synchronize and encrypt vast numbers of QE 4-He
    pairs for distribution across the new communications network it is constructing.\n\nIn
    related news, the next phase of the Jita 4-4 Caldari Navy station redevelopment
    and expansion project is advancing on schedule, according to PKN Interstellar's
    latest updates to the Chief Executive Panel and Caldari Navy board. The project
    is now moving forward to prepare and lay down the foundation frameworks for construction
    of a communications and science hub that will eventually be a major element in
    PKN's FTL communications backbone. Deep Core Mining Incorporated has also begun
    to work on preparations for a mining operations center that will co-ordinate exploitation
    of the vast resources of the Jita 4-4 moon itself.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/PKN_Jita_Project_Phase2.png)

    Circle Starts Fourth Round of Peace Talks on New Protocols for Militia Warzone
    Planets and Orbitals**\n\nYulai, Genesis  - CONCORD's Inner Circle has formally
    begun a fourth round of peace talks aimed at resolving the recent escalations
    in militia warzone fighting and occupations on planetary and other orbital bodies.
    The urgency of the talks is due to the ongoing conflict in the Amarr-Minmatar
    militia warzone, particularly the House Sarum invasion of the Minmatar colony
    world of Floseswin IV.\n\nHowever, a number of recent incidents on militia warzone
    planets, moons and other orbital bodies have exposed shortcomings in the interstellar
    legal framework and conflict resolution protocols. A number of loopholes and gaps,
    that were until recently covered by mutual understandings and informal pacts,
    have been torn open by incidents such as the FDU's pacification of riots by Caldari
    citizens in Iralaja system, Seykal Clan attacks on Huola VI, and notably the lengthy
    corporate warfare and asset removal operations carried out by Lai Dai Protection
    Services on Intaki V. The full-scale invasion and high-intensity warfare on Floseswin
    IV is the worst incident yet in terms of the level of interstellar conflict in
    the border zones and raised tensions between all the CONCORD powers.\n\nReports
    from Yulai suggest that the Inner Circle is establishing a framework that will
    provide time for a number of initiatives being promoted by the Gallente Federation
    and Caldari State to proceed while the CONCORD Assembly prepares draft protocols
    that may form the basis of addendums to the Yulai Convention and Accords, together
    with significant amendments to the Emergency Militia War Powers Act of YC110.\n\n![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/worldnews/images/Yoiul_Meltwater_Exchanger.png)

    Look Forward to Yoiul Festival Celebrations Despite Conflicts Across Cluster**\n\nYulai,
    Genesis  - Despite a year that has seen escalating invasions by the Triglavian
    Collective, and considerably heightened tensions along the border zones between
    the \"Big Four\" empires, the citizens of New Eden are apparently determined to
    make the best of the increasingly cosmopolitan and cluster-wide celebrations of
    the end-of-year Yoiul Festival.\n\nAs part of the festivities, a water reclamation
    project is encouraging capsuleers to turn in any stocks of meltwater they may
    have for processing, with a return of water ice \"snowballs\" for use in the traditional
    capsuleer activity of firing charges of compacted water ice crystals at one another
    in mock space combat. The Meltwater-Snowball Exchanger facilities can be found
    across New Eden's high-security zones at Yoiul Festival sites.\n\n \n\n**In Other
