- body: "The Bleak Lands region of the Amarr Empire has over the past week played
    host to a number of attacks perpetrated by forces of unknown size and affiliation.
    The attacks, mostly targeting independent holder assets and small to mid-sized
    orbital installations, have in all cases been swift and decisive, usually laying
    waste to their targets before responding units can be deployed to the scene.   \n
    \ \nBallistic data from installation wreckage, as well as eyewitness reports from
    colony attacks, have confirmed that the attacking ships are of Matari design,
    though no communication or demands have ever been received from them. Eyewitness
    reports furthermore indicate that the forces have been small and mobile, composed
    mostly of frigates and cruisers.   \n  \nLittle official help has been available
    to holders in the Bleak Lands regions. \u201CThe Navy doesn\u2019t maintain much
    of a presence here,\u201D said Eron Tumak-Ahrim, holder of the Sartrad Territories
    on Hakodan III, which have suffered two separate attacks over the past week, totaling
    approximately three hundred million ISK in lost assets.   \n  \n\u201CThey mostly
    stay near the Throne Worlds these days. They don\u2019t appear to have much time
    for us out here on the fringe,\u201D he said.   \n  \nNavy officials have gone
    on record as stating that \u201Cdue to an ongoing restructuring process within
    [the Amarr Navy] ... our fielded forces must be diverted to areas where they are
    deemed most necessary to Imperial security and the protection of Imperial assets.\u201D
    \  \n  \n\u201CThe situation\u2019s been like this for months,\u201D said Amuran
    Dekorle, an independent strategic correspondent who has written for a number of
    publications worldwide. \u201CThe Navy barely responds to [acting regent Chamberlain
    Dokuta Karsoth\u2019s] directives at all, and when they do it is with slow sullenness.\u201D
    \  \n  \n\u201CThe Empire is really the only place where you could see this happening.
    The Emperor\u2019s authority is absolute ... but regulations don\u2019t make provisions
    for people ruling in his stead for any significant amount of time. There\u2019s
    no real administrative action he can take against them,\u201D Dekorle said. \u201CThey\u2019re
    just responding to whoever holds the most clout among the heirs. It\u2019s all
    one big political patchwork right now.\u201D   \n  \nThe Chamberlain\u2019s Office
    has, according to inside sources, made repeated attempts over the past few days
    to instigate talks with the Minmatar Republic Fleet. It is unknown at this point
    what, if any, communication has gone on between them."
