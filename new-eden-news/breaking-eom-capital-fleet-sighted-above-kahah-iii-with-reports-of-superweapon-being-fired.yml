- body: 'Kahah, Khanid - An EOM capital fleet, reportedly consisting of several dreadnoughts
    and a titan, has been sighted in orbit of Kahah III. There are unconfirmed reports
    of a superweapon being fired at a target on the planet.


    Kahah III is a holding in the Khanid Kingdom dedicated principally to food production
    and has a large population of commoners and slaves. A major slave rebellion flared
    up on Kahah III two and a half years ago, following a series of terrorist attacks
    using a weaponized version of the "Deathglow" narcotic. The rebellion was put
    down brutally by Khanid Kingdom forces including troops under the command of the
    notorious Khanid Warlord Alar Chakaid.


    A recent Brutor Vanguard attack on the Inis-Ilix Theology Council station is believed
    to have removed Chakaid and his associate Orlon Zashev from prison cells where
    they were awaiting trial for war crimes by the Amarr authorities. This incident
    was overshadowed by the recent series of attacks on planets by mercenary dreadnought
    squadrons but some observers have connected it to these events. If a major attack
    against Kahah III is underway such speculations may well be vindicated.'
