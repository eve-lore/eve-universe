    - In the months following Empress Jamyl's emancipation announcement, millions
    of released slaves have made their way to the welcoming arms of the Minmatar Republic.
    Millions more still remain within the Amarr Empire, however, hindered by the fear
    of leaving behind everything that they have ever known.\n\nOnyeka Djekatro was
    a twelfth-generation slave maintaining production line equipment for the Inherent
    Implants factory in Bittanshal. When the emancipation order was issued , the corporation
    released Onyeka's entire family, forcing them to fend for themselves. \"It was
    before the Sisters [of EVE] started their work. We couldn't afford to leave,\"
    Inevne Djekatro, her mother, explains. \"We were told to leave the workers' housing,
    but where are we going to go if there's nowhere else?\" With nowhere to go, the
    family was forced to take menial service jobs on the station in order to pay for
    lodging and food.\n\n\"We thought life would get better at first,\" says Onyeka,
    'But it only got worse. We saved what we could, but it was months before we had
    enough for a place on a shuttle.\" At the expense of reduced power to the family
    of eight's single room apartment, they saved enough to send Onyeka to the Republic
    to begin a new life.\n\nFor the nineteen-year-old woman, the prospect was both
    exciting and terrifying. Her family served Inherent Implants since the installation's
    inception. Onyeka was born on the station, and though some family members were
    sold to other Holders, she has neverleft the station's vicinity. \"I sometimes
    didn't want to go,\" she admits. \"But [my family] decided I would have the best
    chance. I have good skills and some training. Maybe it won't be so bad.\""
