- body: "PATOR - Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor has disclosed that a Minmatar Republic search
    effort for the Thukker caravan missing in Great Wildlands is underway in co-operation
    with the Thukker Tribe. \"We have sent all the Fleet search and rescue vessels
    we have available to the Great Wildlands,\" said Sanmatar Shakor. \"However, much
    of the patrol capacity is tied up with immigrant convoys, trade missions and border
    duties. We also have considerable call on our medical and aid capacity at home
    with the immigrant population. Regrettably, our ability to respond to the appalling
    tragedy of Seyllin is minimal while we divert all resources to the Caravan search.\"
    \ \n  \n\"The search for our Thukker brothers must be our top priority at this
    time.\" concluded the Sanmatar."
