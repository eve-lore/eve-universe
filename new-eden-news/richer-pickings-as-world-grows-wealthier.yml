- body: "The Golden Age of inter-stellar travel has brought great riches and wondrous
    discoveries into the world, but at a price. The lure of plunder has reduced many
    former upstanding citizens to petty thievery and piracy. Strong freighter escort
    in the outer region has saved many from pirate ambushes, yet more and more fall
    pray to these dregs of society every month.   \n  \nAs new, advanced equipment
    enters the market it is only to be expected for this trend to continue in the
    foreseeable future, as CONCORD seems incapable of mounting strong enough resistance
    to these pests feeding on the hard work of others. Fortunately, the low moral
    fiber of the pirates keep them constantly at odds with each other in their petty
    territorial squabbles. One can only hope they do us all a great big favor in the
    near future and annihilate each other completely, leaving the rest of us to conduct
    our business in peace."
