- body: "Rens \u2013 A pair of teenagers are in MedBay today on Rens VI (Moon 8) -
    Brutor tribe Treasury following what appears to be an act of hero-worship. \n\nAccording
    to statements made by medical personnel, the youths (of Brutor tribe lineage)
    appear to have unintentionally blinded themselves in an attempt to bear resemblance
    to the original Defiants and Sanmatar Shakor. \n\nThe youths (whose names are
    being withheld to protect their privacy) appear to have washed their eyes with
    caustic industrial dyes, apparently with the intention of dying their irises white
    permanently. Though neither the teenagers' clan nor the medical facility have
    responded officially, medical histories for both teens (obtained through undisclosed
    sources) indicate a long-standing pattern of mental imbalance and self-inflicted
    injury. \n\nBoth teens are listed as being in stable condition, but are being
    kept under close watch to ensure their safety. A medical spokesperson has stated
    that the teens will require regenerative therapy to repair the corneal and retinal
    damage caused by the dyes, but that they should make a full recovery in time.
    \n\nReports indicate the teenagers' clan is collectively attempting to raise the
    money required for the expensive therapy."
