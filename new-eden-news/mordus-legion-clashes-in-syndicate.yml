    as Mordu's Legion engaged multiple groups of pilots in the PF-346 system. \n\nThe
    Legion, under the command of Lt. Amlerik Raun, gathered together a fleet with
    their allies, Razor alliance. Their mission was to patrol the Syndicate region
    of space and search for any NORAD or Imperium pilots they found. Setting forth
    at 1900 hours, their first and second waypoints, in the 3KNK-A and 3MOG-V systems,
    yielded no hostiles. Recon reports indicated, however, that a large fleet from
    the NORAD alliance was massing in the Orvolle system. \n\nLt. Raun made the decision,
    along with Razor command, to return back to Orvolle. It was in PF-346, the uncontrollable
    system next door to Orvolle, that they met their opposition. \n\nA fleet of Mercenary
    Coalition ships, invited to patrol with Mordu's Legion, were waiting at the Orvolle
    stargate. Some of the Legionnaires, assuming they were there to help, jumped into
    Orvolle where they proceeded to engage NORAD ships. The rest found themselves
    on the wrong side of the Mercenary Coalition's guns. Shortly after this, the BoB
    fleet engaged the Legion ships as well. This resulted in the loss of several Mordu
    Caldari Navy Ravens. \n\n\u201CWe are not the Legion's puppets and will not do
    their bidding,\u201D Eyeshadow, a member of Sharks With Frickin' Laser Beams,
    said. \u201CWe are loyal to our friends, but we expected more from Mordus and
    their lack of any contact just proves what they think of us.\u201D When asked
    if the Mercenary Coalition was trying to supplant Mordu's Legion in the mercenary
    business, Eyeshadow replied, \u201CWe believe we are already the top mercenary
    force in the universe. We have proven we can fulfil any task and take on the biggest
    odds.\u201D Echoing Eyeshadow's dismissal of the Legion was Shrike, a leading
    figure in the BoB alliance. \u201CNo one is allowed to enter into our regions
    looking for targets,\u201D Shrike explained, as she pursued the Legion through
    Syndicate, \u201CWe hope these guys brought some guts with their fancy ships.\u201D
    After the initial patrol was destroyed or left PF-346, a fast-response team of
    Legion pilots was dispatched to PF-346, though they quickly left. \n\nIs this
    the end of Legion patrols in the Syndicate? Preliminary reports suggest the answer
    to this is a negative. Raun withdrew some of his ships to the Federation Navy
    Plant orbiting Orvolle I, where they docked for repairs. Raun explained that his
    move to Orvolle was not to evade the BoB or Mercenary Coalition fleets. \u201CWe
    were after NORAD,\u201D he explained over drinks at the lounge. \u201CThey have
    proven themselves to be hostile and we want to clear the area of hostiles. Even
    though we've withdrawn from our ORE contract, we still have a vested interest
    in the region.\u201D When asked about the actions of the Mercenary Coalition and
    BoB, he declined to comment. \n\nHowever, it seems like yesterday's fire fight
    had a silver lining, as Shivaja of NORAD talked to Lt. Raun and discussed the
    possibility of a ceasefire. According to Lt. Raun, their only demand is that NORAD
    issues an official apology for their actions during the mordu pullback. It seems
    likely that such an apology will be forthcoming."
