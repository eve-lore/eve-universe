    - Governor Ekroz Salaf arrived in Tanoo system yesterday to take up his duties
    as plenipotentiary of Royal Heir Yonis Ardishapur in the Ammatar Mandate. Ammatar
    Consulate officials have stated that Governor Salaf will spend a few days familiarizing
    himself with the latest Mandate developments before embarking on a tour of inspection
    across Derelik region.\n\nAs head of the Ammatar Consulate, Governor Salaf will
    run the civil administration of the Mandate on behalf of House Ardishapur. The
    Ammatar Fleet, under Grand Admiral Hastar Jibril, will continue to report directly
    to Heir Ardishapur although the Governor will have the authority to directly request
    Ammatar Fleet deployments as necessary. The Ardishapur reorganization of the civil
    and military branches of the Mandate recasts each as separate centers of power
    answering to Yonis Ardishapur as Holder of Derelik region.\n\nMorale among the
    Ammatar populace has risen considerably in the weeks since the announcement of
    Governor Salaf's appointment. As an ethnic Ammatar, his selection has allayed
    rising fears that the Ardishapur regime intended to permanently relegate the Ammatar
    people to a subservient role in the region. His years spent as a senior official
    at the Ministry of Assessment in Domain region have also attracted comment. Observers
    of imperial politics agree that the choice of Ekroz Salaf was a shrewd move by
    Yonis Ardishapur, given that the Governor represents an Ammatar figurehead untainted
    by the failings of the previous regime and of proven loyalty to the Amarr Empire."
