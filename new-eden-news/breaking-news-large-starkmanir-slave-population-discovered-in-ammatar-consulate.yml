- body: "Elgoi - The renowned Minmatar Republic biotech corporation Eifyr & Co. held
    a press conference today announcing the discovery of a large, \"genetically pristine\"
    population of Starkmanir slaves residing on the sixth planet of the Jarizza System.
    The Sisters of EVE, a charitable organization with an established humanitarian
    mission, apparently made the discovery \"by accident\" and reported the findings
    directly to Eifyr shortly after leaving the planet. The corporation confirmed
    the findings in a nationally broadcast press conference just moments ago. The
    survival of the Starkmanir Tribe, believed to have been extinct for hundreds of
    years, has shocked the Minmatar Republic. \n\n\"We have in our possession approximately
    one thousand unique samples taken from a population of slaves on the Ammatar world
    'Halturzhan',\" Eifyr spokesman Frelf Laer said. \"We've completed genome sequencing
    on each of them. They're authentic. There's no lineage or association with the
    other tribes at all. We know they're Starkmanir because the sequences match those
    extracted from ancient burial sites.\" \n\nWhen asked whether the Starkmanir population
    knew that, the spokesman answered \"You'll have to ask the Sisters of EVE. They
    were the ones allowed onto the surface, allegedly to look into a viral outbreak
    that the Ammatar overlords couldn't control. This particular slave population
    specialized in agricultural labor, and I'm almost certain that none of them know
    anything about their own origins, or what their existence means to Minmatar.\"
    \n\nThe Sisters have referred all inquiries back to Eifyr, stating only that \"They
    have all of the relevant facts. Our mission was and continues to be a mission
    of the human spirit, nothing more.\""
