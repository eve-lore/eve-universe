- body: "Stunning news has just filtered out of the Amarr Empire. Doriam II, Emperor
    of Amarr, is dead at the hands of an unknown assailant.   \n  \nDetails are still
    sketchy at this moment, but the Emperor's death has just been confirmed by the
    Imperial Chancellor's Office. The Privy Council has been called together to sit
    in emergency session.   \n  \nChamberlain Karsoth, the acting regent, was visibly
    shaken when confronted by the media outside his office an hour ago. Nevertheless
    standing firm in his condemnation of the heinous act, he stated that the Empire
    would \"spare nothing in hunting down the perpetrators, wherever they might hide.\"
    \  \n  \nWhile the Chamberlain refused to confirm early rumors as to the killer's
    identity, he did state that \"foreign elements will not succeed in spreading chaos
    and discord throughout our great empire.\" When asked to elaborate the Chamberlain
    declined to comment any further, instead urging his nation to \"remain brave in
    the face of this unspeakable tragedy.\"   \n  \nThe Imperial Navy has been put
    on full alert. All border areas are being closely watched, particularly those
    leading into Republic and Federation space, with emergency stargate reroute plans
    reportedly being put into effect.   \n  \nMore news as they come in."
