    are looking forward to harvesting the riches of the Black Rise region. Kaalakiota,
    Lai Dai and other mega-corporations within the State announced large-scale projects
    last week, followed by equally determined independent ventures. \n\nAccording
    to data published by House of Records, the number of colonists moving to the Black
    Rise region has more than doubled in recent months. Most of the settlers are contracted
    by corporations conducting Black Rise operations, but some are also striking out
    on their own.\n\n\"We are often perceived as a nation of corporate drones, but
    this is not so,\" said Massoka Weikollen, a retired army veteran. Until recently
    Mr Weikollen had owned a machine repair facility in Piak, but he is now moving
    to Black Rise with his family, aiming to set up a similar business on one of the
    planets there. \"The important thing is that our society was built on the principles
    of personal initiative and free enterprise, and that is exactly what is happening
    now.\"\n\nThe State's corporations were quick to cater to the resulting demand.
    Skyrise Constructions, a planetside property developer specializing in construction
    of autonomous biosphere complexes, had unveiled a range of planetside projects
    in\n\nBlack Rise. The planets in question include Villasen IV, which was recently
    re-secured by State Protectorate forces. Skyrise Constructions is partly owned
    by Sukuuvestaa, and it is expected that the corporation will bid for the funds
    available under the CAESA act.\n\nWith the guns still blazing, it might be too
    early to jump to definite conclusions, but political and military experts like
    the renowned Andra Veaux are sure that, in Veau'x words, \"the opportunities in
    regions like Black Rise have finally started outweighing the risks for the Caldari
    people.\""
