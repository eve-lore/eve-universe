    Executor Tibus Heth has ordered the creation of the \"State Loyalty Tribunal,\"
    an independent committee tasked with investigating national security threats within
    the highest ranks of Caldari corporate and political power. \"Recent events have
    made it clear that our enemies seek to subvert the State at every level,\" said
    Heth. \"The State Loyalty Tribunal will bring an end to this and prevent further
    infiltration.\"\n\nAsiaineras Isuki, commander of the Home Guard's Surveillance
    Division, has been appointed to fill the chairman's seat for the new Tribunal.
    The other members of the committee have not yet been announced, but insiders tell
    the Scope that they will likely be selected from the ranks of the Caldari Providence
    Directorate and Patriot-bloc megacorporate security forces.\n\nSo far, Lai Dai
    and Wiyrkomi have pledged to cooperate with the new body, but the other megacorporations
    have so far declined to comment publicly. Privately, sources at Hyasyoda and Nugoeihuvi
    have told the Scope that they perceive this as yet another attempt by Heth to
    encroach upon corporate sovereignty, and that they are preparing legal challenges
    should the State Loyalty Tribunal target their employees."
