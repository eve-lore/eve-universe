- body: "Concord conflict-nets, the monitoring networks tasked with assigning security
    hits to perpetrators of interstellar violence, recorded a small but curious skirmish
    on the border between the Khanid and Amarr empires. The skirmish is notable not
    for its size, but for the circumstances of the engagement and the vessels involved.\n\nAt
    approximately 18:23 Eve Standard time, a small task-force of Brutor Tribe Stabber
    cruisers and Breacher frigates crossed into the Amarr Empire, evading military
    checkpoints and bee-lining for the Khanid territories. At the same time, a convoy
    of Amarr vessels escorting a sole Caldari executive shuttle departed from the
    Agil system, raising quite a few eyebrows as it did \u2013 mainly due to the fact
    that this convoy was composed of two Silver Magnate frigates, and the only Gold
    Magnate in existence \u2013 a priceless vessel by any definition. The identity
    of the mysterious Caldari shuttle\u2019s occupant is unknown, but this much is
    certain \u2013 the unique Gold Magnate was not piloted by Ecliptical, victor of
    the Amarr Championship and its prior owner. The only identifying moniker that
    registered on the conflict-nets (as a result of landing the majority of killing
    blows) was \u201CTyrrax Thorrk\u201D.\n\nThe two groups of vessels collided at
    19:17 EST \u2013 with shouts of \u201Cwarmonger!\u201D and \u201Cmurderer!\u201D
    over the public channel, the Minmatar force opened fire upon the Amarr, at first
    targeting the shuttle which took evasive manoeuvres, but soon redirecting their
    missiles and cannon against the three gleaming pinnacles of Amarr fighting technology
    \u2013 in moments, the Minmatar battle-group was annihilated by the utterly superior
    piloting skills of the Magnate captains.\n\nLocal chat-nets are abuzz with speculation:
    Who were these wealthy frigate captains \u2013 were they the notorious Khanid
    system-holders whose riches are matched only by their cunning, and who own entire
    world-factories staffed by millions of slaves? Who was the alleged \u201Cwar criminal\u201D
    aboard the Caldari shuttle emerging from Khanid space, and why did he warrant
    such a resplendent and powerful escort? Only time may tell, as the last sighting
    of the Amarr convoy had it heading into the borders of the Caldari State."
