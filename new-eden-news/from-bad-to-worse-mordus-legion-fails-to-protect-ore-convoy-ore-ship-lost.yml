- body: "In what seems to confirm previous reports about the diplomatic ties between
    ORE and the Mordu\u2019s Legion deteriorating almost to breaking point, an ORE
    convoy of 3 cargo ships was left waiting by its Mordu\u2019s escort yesterday
    at 4C-B7X.   \n  \nAlready behind schedule, chief ORE transport pilot Zeenu Breede
    decided to turn to local freelance pilots for help. Showing quite a talent for
    diplomacy, Breede managed to convince Laycosya from The Imperium and Shivaja from
    NORAD to strike a temporary cease fire in their ongoing hostilities, and provide
    the ORE convoy with some help reaching Gallente controlled space.   \n  \nWith
    the forces Shivaja and Laycosya were able to put together and unwilling to remain
    in unsecured space any longer, Breede decided to move towards their destination.
    After successfully fending off an attack by two Serpentis ships, the convoy confronted
    a TRS gate camp which proved to be above their forces.   \n  \nWhile waiting for
    reinforcements, TRS operatives attacked the convoy bringing down one of the ORE
    transports. According to reports, downed ORE pilot Shakota Frendorn\u2019s pod
    was spared and allowed to reach Orvolle after toll was negotiated.   \n  \nWhen
    contacted about this episode, Captain Agutigur Aetangur from ORE Security publicly
    thanked both The Imperium and NORAD representatives for their help.   \n  \nAbout
    the missing Mordu\u2019s ship, Aetangur commented: \"Disappointing, but not entirely
    unexpected. There was a time when Mordu\u2019s Legion was the symbol of professionalism.
    Nowadays, they do not see to be able to even show on time. The Legion is certainly
    not up to their legendary reputation anymore.\"   \n  \n\"Our legal branch has
    already initiated the corresponding actions to receive compensations for our losses.\"
    \  \n  \nMordu\u2019s officials refused to comment on this issue."
