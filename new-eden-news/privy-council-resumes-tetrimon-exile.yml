- body: "Spokespeople for the Privy Council announced a withdrawal of the council\u2019s
    temporary pardon for members of the cult of Tetrimon on Sunday afternoon; just
    weeks after the Theology Council disavowed the Tetrimon Scrolls they were investigating.\n\nThe
    announcement came shortly after a regular meeting of the Privy Council, the political
    body composed of the Amarrian heirs and currently leading the empire in the absence
    of a new emperor. The statement read \u201CAfter much consideration, due to the
    fact that edict banning the Cult from Empire space can only be overturned by the
    Emperor, and the lack of validity in the documents known as the Tetrimon Scrolls,
    the privy council is revoking its temporary suspension of the banning edict, effective
    immediately. All Tetrimon members are hereby ordered to leave the Empires territories
    within 3 standard days, or face punishment by the full might of the Amarr Navy.\u201D
    The spokesman declined to comment further, but sources indicate that the Privy
    Council\u2019s hand was forced by the intervention of the Theology Council. \n\nThe
    Theology Council had made its own announcement, 2 weeks earlier, indicating that
    the majority of the Tetrimon Cult\u2019s claims were not supported by the Tetrimon
    Scrolls. According to Deacon Lorenzo Azir, a Theology Council spokesman, while
    the historical events described in the scrolls were indeed congruous with other
    official documentation existing from that time period, the rest of the text contained
    within was less accurate. Azir explained, \u201CThese scriptures are filled with
    passages contradicting themselves. They are also missing key parts that would
    be vital for our scholars to be able to verify their true origin or authenticate
    them as the Holy Scriptures.\u201D \n\nDue to these facts the Theology council
    elected to describe the scrolls as inconclusive, which while far from being a
    definitive no, is negative enough in tone to seriously dent Tetrimon hopes of
    having the Scrolls reintegrated with Amarrian holy texts in the near future. The
    fact that Theology Council also elected to retain possession of the scrolls for
    \u201Csafekeeping from the hands of would-be terrorists and elements who would
    plot to destabilise the empire,\u201D indicates that a significant shift in the
    balance of power would need to occur within the empire before such an event \u2013
    or even an overturning of the edict banning the Cult from empire space \u2013
    could occur."
