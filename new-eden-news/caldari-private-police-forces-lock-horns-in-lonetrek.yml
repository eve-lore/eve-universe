- body: "Yesterday afternoon saw warning shots fired between vessels from the Ishukone
    and Kaalakiota corporations' private police forces, the Ishukone Watch and the
    Home Guard.   \n  \nReports indicate that at just after 16:00 EVT, a contingent
    of Ishukone Watch ships appeared near Kaalakiota HQ in Nonni. Failing to respond
    to hails on open frequencies, Watch forces proceeded to initiate long-range scans
    of the area, in response to which Home Guard battleships and Kaalakiota sentry
    guns fired warning shots, ordering them out of the system.   \n  \nNiteloho Koirolen,
    Kaalakiota spokesman, called the altercation \"a direct result of the unannounced
    and unexpected presence of an Ishukone Watch squadron in close proximity to Kaalakiota
    holdings.\"   \n  \n\"There are mutually agreed-upon private zones into which
    corporation police forces don't cross. The Ishukone Watch know this as well as
    we do. We are currently in discussion with the Ishukone Corporation as to the
    nature of these transgressions, and we sincerely hope this can be resolved without
    further incident,\" said Koirolen.   \n  \nIshukone representatives were unavailable
    for comment."
