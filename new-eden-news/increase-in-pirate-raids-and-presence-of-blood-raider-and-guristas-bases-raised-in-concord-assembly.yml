- body: 'Yulai - Rising levels of pirate raiding activity against empire resource
    fields have been brought up as an urgent matter of concern at the CONCORD Assembly
    by representatives from the four major empires. Questions were also asked about
    the presence of pirate "Forward Operating Bases" and intelligence assessments
    that the number of these bases could increase.


    Meeting at a special session of the CONCORD Assembly called to discuss cluster-wide
    security threats and response co-ordination, delegates raised a number of questions
    about the increase in raids by all the major pirate and criminal organizations.
    Dismay was expressed at the boldness of Angel Cartel, Blood Raider, Guristas and
    Serpentis strikes on empire mining expeditions and resource extraction operations.
    On this matter a joint resolution was adopted to extend and expand the program
    of hiring capsuleer freelancers through the services of the Agency, a clearing
    house for capsuleer freelance and mercenary activities.


    The Amarr Empire and Caldari State delegations were particularly forceful in raising
    the issue of the Blood Raider and Guristas "Forward Operating Bases", and pressed
    the DED''s General Odo Korachi to share intelligence assessments said to indicate
    a rise in the number of such bases being established by the pirate groups. General
    Korachi responded that "the concerns have been heard and this matter will be referred
    to the Inner Circle for immediate consideration."


    With pirate activity dominating the session, there was only a brief discussion
    of so-called "emergent threats" such as the Drifters and rogue drones. DED command
    authority was described as "monitoring the emergent threat profile at all times".'
