- body: "ESSENCE - The newly formed Caldari Pleasures Corporation began acquiring
    goods, services and personnel from the Oursulaert system last week. The corporation\u2019s
    founders recently announced their intention of setting up an entertainment and
    relaxation centre in the Sivala System of the Citadel region. Viga Monten and
    Grenall Vek started the company with the idea that Caldari business travellers
    need a place to relax and unwind that will rival even the most luxurious of the
    Gallente pleasure hubs. \n\nGrenall Vek described their plan to offer \u201Cnew
    and exciting, never before seen entertainment!\u201D to the local Oursulaert pilots,
    who seemed glad to aid the new corporation in its endeavour. He made several deals
    and purchased pleasure hub essentials such as Spiced Wine, Quafe Ultra, Holoreels
    and of course \u201CExotic Dancers of the highest quality.\u201D Vek was also
    surprised by the donation of a Marine security detachment and janitorial personnel
    from pilot Doh Tajori, who seemed eager for a free pass to a not yet announced
    grand opening party. \n\nAlthough details about the new corporation\u2019s finances
    and any possible partners were not available, both Vek and Monten were very confident
    that they would be able to fill a niche market that has been lacking for the business-weary
    Caldari that frequent the Essence and Citadel regions. \n\nAll inquiries to the
    Caldari government about permits for such a station in the Caldari Border Zone
    went unanswered. A low level official who requested anonymity remarked, \u201CThis
    is another case of the Gallente way of life poisoning the good Caldari people.\u201D"
