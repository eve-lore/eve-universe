- body: "One of the few seemingly universal truths across the world of EVE is that
    all families are home to their fair share of conflict, with the owning family
    of the Team Dragon race team being no exception.   \n  \nAccording to a CONCORD
    statement issued in conjunction with Team Dragon officials, two high spec racers
    were stolen from their hangars in the Caldari system last Tuesday. The act was
    perpetrated by Otoo Ogami, son of the notable race team owner Katsen Ogami with
    his accomplice friend Hanzonas Kitota. Together the two fled to Nonni where they
    were cornered by rallied members of the pod pilot community.   \n  \nFollowing
    the trapping of the two racers within the system, Katsen Ogamai called for the
    surrender of his son and his accomplice in order to allow the safe return of the
    prized vessels. Following a heated row and the refusal of the two to hand over
    their newly acquired prizes Katsen called for the destruction of both ships, with
    further threats stating that Hanzonas Kitota would be executed as punishment for
    further disobedience. In the ensuing chase Honzonas Kitona was shot down by assisting
    pod pilot forces, leading to the surrender and capture of the team owner\u2019s
    son.   \n  \nIn a shocking twist, Otoo Ogami was handed over to CONCORD on the
    orders of his farther on charges of theft, apparently to teach his son a valuable
    lesson that he would not forget."
