- body: 'X-7OMU - In a brief statement issued today, the Sisters of EVE corporation
    confirmed that their analysis of the Caroline''s Star phenomenon is that it was
    the result of ''a stellar-level disruption of space-time involving the central
    star of the W477-P system in the UUA-F4 region''. The statement, made in the name
    of the SOE''s Reverend Mother Santimona Sarpati, went on to officially confirm
    for the first time that the ''Thera Incident'' that devastated the SOE colony
    in W-space was the result of the Caroline''s Star stellar event.


    As well as briefly outlining the SOE''s conclusions regarding W477-P and the cataclysmic
    destruction in Thera, the statement asserted ''the Sisters of EVE organization
    is co-operating closely with CONCORD, particularly in the light of the emergence
    of new and as yet poorly understood threats such as the so-called "Drifters" and
    the apparently Jove structures that have appeared across New Eden''. Requests
    for further clarification of the SOE statement''s contents have been refused.'
