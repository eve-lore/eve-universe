- body: "Wednesday saw the latest in a series of ongoing clashes between the Amarr
    Navy and the forces of the Blood Raider Covenant. Two main battles are reported
    to have been fought; a Covenant ammunition convoy was taken down in the Alkabsi
    system by Navy forces assisted by capsuleer fighters, after which a retaliatory
    strike against a Navy scout team in Haras saw Covenant forces and loyalist capsuleers
    strike back against the Empire.   \n  \nCapsuleer organizations involved in the
    fighting include Empire loyalists Aegis Militia and the Curatores Veritatis Alliance,
    Covenant loyalists Blood Inquisition fighting alongside members of Finite Horizon
    and Developmental Neogenics Amalgamated, and members of the Huzzah Federation,
    who fought on the side of the Amarr though their exact ideological affiliations
    are unclear at this point.   \n  \nThe dual-layered nature of Wednesday\u2019s
    battles has military experts intrigued. \u201CIt\u2019s been a long time coming,\u201D
    says Matteus Harpet, a noted independent station security contractor and military
    analyst working out of Oursulaert. \u201CEver since they arrived on the scene,
    we\u2019ve known the eggers are the next step. They\u2019ve been steadily growing
    in power and influence, and their involvement in wars like these comes as no surprise.
    It\u2019s interesting to see how there are really two battles being fought here;
    one between the Empire and the Raiders, the other between their loyalist capsuleer
    factions. The dynamics of interplay are intriguing.\u201D   \n  \nAsked whether
    he believes capsuleers will come to play a greater role in the future of intergalactic
    conflict, Harpet replied, \u201CSeriously, look around you. I give it two years
    before the empire navies will be assisting the capsuleers with their wars, and
    not the other way around.\u201D   \n  \nThe past week has seen numerous strikes
    against Blood Raider assets and hideouts on the sovereign fringe, with imperial
    Navy forces proclaiming major tactical coups almost without fail. In a release
    earlier this afternoon, Ministry of War spokeswoman Ialema Kalonne stated that
    Navy forces had, in the week since declaring a state of war against the Blood
    Raider Covenant, destroyed an estimated four billion ISK's worth of Covenant assets
    in coordinated strikes on stations and on planetary outposts.   \n  \nThese announcements
    of success come in the face of expressed concern among certain holders that the
    Amarr Empire is not conducting itself in a manner behooving a superpower of its
    stature. Earlier this week, speaking from the steps of the Sarum estate on Sarum
    Prime, appointed family guardian Pomikide Haromi sternly reprimanded the Empire
    for \u201Ctaking up the proportional response tactics espoused by advocates of
    democracy and other hopelessly feeble forms of governance.\u201D The holder further
    went on to state that \u201CThe Empire should do as Empires do: overwhelm their
    enemies and grind them into dust, eradicate them so thoroughly that only a fading
    memory remains.\u201D"
