- body: "In continuing efforts to bring the five empires closer together, Concord
    today promised increased news coverage of known space, chiefly through the syndication
    of reports from journalists representing the variety of cultures and regions under
    Concord's jurisdiction.   \n  \n\"Our goal with this program is simple: to bring
    the news to the people in a timely and straight-forward fashion,\" a Concord spokesperson
    said. \"The syndication of these reports from these journalists is one of the
    methods we're turning to in order to accomplish this.\" When asked about possible
    bias among the reporters, the spokesperson replied, \"I'm sure we can rely on
    our reporters for the utmost in objectivity and honesty, regardless of their race
    or empire of origin.\"   \n  \nAmong the reporters chosen by Concord is Lemetar
    Relem, a Sebiestor Minmatar formerly of Republic University. Relem will largely
    be covering the Minmatar regions and issues important to the people who live and
    work in those systems, as well as continuing developments along the Minmatar-Amarr
    border systems.   \n  \nLemetar Relem prepared this item, and wishes to state
    that he is honored to have been chosen by Concord for syndication."
