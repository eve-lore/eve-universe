- body: "Malkalen - Still reeling from today's unprovoked atrocity, the Ishukone Corporation
    has released a statement announcing the formation of an emergency disaster relief
    program. The damage caused by the impact of the FNS Wandering Saint on the Ishukone
    Headquarters station has left many survivors trapped within the superstructure,
    and while repair and rescue crews are battling to rescue them, efforts are hampered
    by chemical fires, extensive power failures and the constant threat of further
    decompressions and detonations. \n\nJeanna Kishuo, an Ishukone official helping
    co-ordinate efforts from the nearby Ishukone Watch station revealed that \"there's
    no proper chain of command right now - everyone's doing everything they can but
    we can't get access to the Corporation's general funds because there's nobody
    around who can authorize it.\" When asked what else could be done, she replied
    \"get the news out to the capsuleers - we're bleeding here, and if they want to
    do any damn good tell them we need supplies hauled in yesterday! We're running
    out of critical hardware and people are dying right now because of it!\" \n\nBuy
    orders for the needed items, including antibiotics and hydrogen batteries, have
    been placed by Ishkuone representiative Jeanna Kishuo at Malkalen III - Ishukone
    Watch Assembly Plant using the remaining available funds. Ishukone has appealed
    to all loyal Caldari citizens to fill these orders as quickly as possible in order
    that further loss of life be avoided."
