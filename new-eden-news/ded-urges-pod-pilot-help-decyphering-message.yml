    the DED has been keeping records of comm transmissions originating from the Phoenix
    constellation, marking high priority messages and attempting to decrypt them for
    valuable intelligence. So far, the DED has had marginal success, receiving several
    routine shipment orders and a few personal communications to loved ones. \n\nToday,
    the DED released the following transmission originating from the headquarters
    of the Serpentis Corporation. They ask for pod pilot groups in Serpentis space
    and the regions surrounding Fountain to assist in decrypting the message as well
    as interpreting the meaning. When asked if the DED had any idea what this message
    contained, our contact replied, \u201CUnfortunately, during decryption the message
    was corrupted and much of the data was lost. However, we believe that the contents
    of this message will directly affect those groups living near Serpentis space.\u201D
