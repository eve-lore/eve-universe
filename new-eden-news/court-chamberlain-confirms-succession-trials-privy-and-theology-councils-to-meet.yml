- body: "Amarr Prime - With the Amarr Empire still reeling from the shock of the Drifter
    sneak attack that killed Empress Jamyl I, imperial authorities are moving rapidly
    to ensure an orderly succession process, overseen by Court Chamberlain Pomik Haromi.
    Under the protocols of the Amarr Empire, the Court Chamberlain is tasked with
    maintaining continuity of the imperial government while providing for succession
    to the throne by one of the Royal Heirs.\n\nSpeaking from the Imperial Palace
    in the holy city of Dam-Torsad on Amarr Prime, Lord Pomik Haromi made a brief
    statement confirming that the succession process would use the traditional trials
    of champions to determine the next occupant of the Golden Throne of Amarr. \n\nIn
    remarks that signal a return to the normal order of royal successions, Lord Haromi
    stated, \"As there appears to be no immediate choice by the hand of the divine,
    it is my sacred duty to declare a succession by trials of those champions chosen
    by the Royal Houses. As prowess in defending Holy Amarr is to the fore of our
    minds, I would expect paladins from the ranks of our loyal capsuleers to declare
    themselves available to their liege lords.\"\n\nThe Court Chamberlain concluded
    his remarks by indicating that the Privy and Theology Councils would be meeting
    in special conclave to determine the particulars and laws applying to the succession
    trials."
