- body: "3HQC-6 - Breaking news has reached The Scope in the last hour, detailing
    a coordinated set of armed strikes against Ducia Foundry mining operations in
    the region of Outer Ring.\n\nInitial reports indicate that three joint taskforces
    of Serpentis Corporation and Guardian Angel vessels staged simultaneous ambushes
    on heavily armed Ducia Foundry mining convoys in the systems of 3HQC-6, L3-XYO
    and LGUZ-1, destroying all mining vessels and ancillary hardware after laying
    waste to their escorts.\n\nDucia Foundry recently became a member of the newly
    formed Upwell Consortium, granting the corporation mining and resource gathering
    rights in the region, and it is believed that the corporation's operations in
    the area were targeted as a direct response to the removal of Serpentis influence
    over the region in recent weeks.\n\nThe Upwell Consortium has vehemently condemned
    the attacks in a statement that also confirmed one of the pirate taskforces was
    pursued and destroyed in the system of 7-692B by a Mordu's Legion security patrol.
    \n\nSeveral witnesses of the firefight indicated that the Serpentis Corporation
    vessels were in full retreat back toward the border with their home region of
    Fountain when they were set upon by Legion vessels, once again calling into question
    the Upwell Consortium's use of force, with some critics labelling it as excessive.\n\nWhen
    approached by the Scope with questions regarding claims of excessive use of force,
    Strike Commander Tsuni Aina of Mordu's Legion Command commented that \"We [Mordu's
    Legion Command] have a contracted obligation to provide protection for assets
    belonging to the Upwell Consortium, and we will continue to do so with every gram
    of strength our assigned taskforce can muster.\n\n\"Mordu's Legion Command prides
    itself on the skill and tenacity of its pilots on the battlefield, and while losses
    like today's attack do occur from time to time, our response has and will continue
    to be of the largest magnitude possible, in order to send a clear message that
    if the Serpentis Corporation continue to threaten the operations of our client,
    they will face an enemy the like of which they have never had to deal with in
    the history of their operations.\"\n\nWhile details are still unconfirmed at this
    stage, it is rumored that Ducia Foundry lost in excess of sixty thousand industrial
    personnel and hardware to the value of thirty billion kredits in the attack, which
    also left more than ninety Serpentis Corporation vessels destroyed and an unconfirmed
    number of their personnel dead."
