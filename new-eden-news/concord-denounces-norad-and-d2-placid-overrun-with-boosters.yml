- body: "Saturday saw a massive struggle in the Outer Ring and Syndicate regions of
    space, as first the Band of Brothers struck several blows against starbases in
    Outer Ring, then as the D2 and NORAD alliances escorted a shipment of Serpentis
    boosters into the Orvolle system. Intercepted by a CONCORD Rapid Response Team
    (RRT) and several brave pilots from Orvolle, the two alliances decimated five
    CONCORD Special Ops battleships and three CONCORD Special Ops cruisers, as well
    as destroying their pod pilot escorts. Between the chaos, four Serpentis Obelisk
    freighters slipped into Orvolle and, through falsified transponders, managed to
    dock at the Federation Navy Assembly Plant. Once docked, several thousand marines
    stationed within the ships held the docking ports open, as a veritable parade
    of known and suspected drug smugglers docked and undocked with their cargo. With
    CONCORD in disarray after the attack, few were caught before they left the system.
    \n\nThe catastrophe is already being called by some Senators, \u201Cthe worst
    blunder in years.\u201D The Senate Subcommittee on Border Security and Customs
    cited insufficient intelligence and a lack of force as the most critical issues
    during the attack, saying that if CONCORD had had a few more hours to organize
    a response, the situation would be much different. Senator Adrienne, however,
    an outspoken opponent of pod pilot excesses, has placed the blame squarely on
    the pod pilot community. Speaking before the full Senate, she expressed her anger
    that anyone, including pod pilots, could let this happen. Escorting the freighters
    was an act of \u201Cbarbarism\u201D and \u201Clawlessness,\u201D she said, rivaling
    the Serpentis Corporation itself. Her transcript appears here, unedited, in part:
    \n\n\u201CFellow Senators, this is just another example of the liberties these
    pod pilots take with our people. To them, life seems like a game. If you shoot
    one down, their clone wakes up half the universe away, spluttering and choking,
    but very much alive. Meanwhile, we're faced with a drug epidemic in half of the
    systems of Placid! These four freighters unloaded an estimated 18.75 million \u2013
    yes, million \u2013 units of boosters and drugs to drug cartels operating throughout
    the Federation. Think of the children who will be affected by this! We've long
    known that the Serpentis Corporation has been behind much of the drug problem,
    but to see pod pilots, whom our population idolizes, overtly support them? This
    goes beyond insult. This is nothing less than an act of war against the Federation.\u201D
    \n\nOpinion seems split among Senators, as other speakers pointed out that many
    pod pilots greatly contribute to the security of the Federation, and that the
    actions of a few should not condemn the whole. Still, Senator Adrienne commands
    a sizable section of the Senate, and could prove a deciding factor in future negotiations
    between the parties. \n\nCONCORD itself issued a declaration of piracy against
    the D2 and NORAD alliances, saying that their actions were effectively allying
    themselves with the Serpentis. Commissioner Kunken, commander of the RRT that
    fought against the pod pilots and the Serpentis, had no comment, but the Office
    of Pilot Relations promised to levy sanctions and fines against those who fought
    against CONCORD, as well as rewarding the pod pilots who stood with them against
    the Serpentis. \u201CWe honor the sacrifices those pilots made, and we know that
    in the future, more pilots will stand with us against tyranny and lawlessness
    in the frontier.\u201D \n\nSerpentis Corporation officials were unavailable for
    comment."
