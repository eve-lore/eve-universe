- body: "In a recent sting operation, Spacelane Patrol internal security arrested
    several officers involved in a drug transaction with representatives of the Guristas
    pirate organization. The investigation focused on a small group of officers working
    out of the Oipo detachment of the Patrol. This operation is the culmination of
    weeks of investigative work by the security division, and is being hailed as proof
    that the organization is capable of policing its own members.  \n  \nWhile this
    success is good news, it may only be the tip of the iceberg when dealing with
    internal corruption. Reports are already being leaked that these officers are
    part of a much larger group within the Patrol, who have been collaborating with
    the Gurista's in various illegal activities, and protecting the Gurista's interests.
    \ \n  \n\"We are looking deeper into the accusations, and a full scale investigation
    is already underway.\" said Ameroisen Kuori, Commander of the Spacelane Patrol
    Security division. \"Corruption within the ranks will not be tolerated and we
    will root out the source of it. Those responsible will be brought to justice,
    no matter how high within the ranks this corruption goes.\""
