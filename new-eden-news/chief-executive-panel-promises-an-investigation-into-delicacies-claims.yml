- body: The Caldari Chief Executive Panel, the highest authority within the Caldari
    State, has decided to look into the grave matters surrounding the Protein Delicacies
    manufactured and distributed by the Sukuuvestaa Corporation. The Panel will decide
    whether there is a cause for any further actions to be taken in the matter. The
    Federation has already sent stern protests to Caldari authorities through diplomatic
    channels within CONCORD, and spokesman for the Federation said he hoped this investigation
    by the Chief Executive Panel was an indication that the Caldari were taking these
    protests seriously and would subsequently take appropriate action against the
    culprits.
