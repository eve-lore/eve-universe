- body: News filtering out of the border zones close to Stain that Ouria and his gang
    have been decisively defeated have been met with joy and relief by the civilized
    world. The reports are a bit sketchy, but from what can be gathered it seems Ouria
    and five of his fellow Jovians, flying Eidolon battleships, hooked up with the
    known Minmatar terrorist organization Oracle close to Stain. 18 Oracle members
    flying cruisers joined forces with the Jovians. A task force consisting mainly
    of members of the Stain Alliance met the Ouria and his friends in DSS-EZ system.
    The task force consisted of 15-20 battleships and 15-20 cruisers. The battle raged
    for awhile and when the smoke cleared all the Jovian ships as well as all the
    Oracle cruisers were smoldering rubble. It is believed the task force lost less
    than 10 ships in total.
