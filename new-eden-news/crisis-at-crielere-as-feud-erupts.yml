- body: "Finally, after weeks of rumors and speculations, the truth over the disappearance
    of several valuable blueprints from the Crielere station has been revealed. As
    expected, some very high-ranking individuals are involved and the whole matter
    seems poised to topple the Crielere research program.  \n  \nAt the heart of the
    plot to steal original blueprints and prototype items stands the CEO of Ishukone,
    Otro Gariushi himself. It seems that the Caldari were becoming annoyed by what
    they considered lack of professionalism in the Gallente scientists and decided
    to take matter into their own hands to \u2018rectify matters.\u2019 Indeed, now
    that the ugly truth is out, the formerly evasive Gariushi has come out with all
    guns blazing. In a short interview yesterday he said that \u2018the Caldari had
    carried the Crielere program on their shoulders from the start and it was only
    just that they\u2019d get their fair share for this.\u2019 He carried on by saying
    that he \u2018had no regrets over what had been done, the world as a whole had
    benefited from the toil of the Caldari scientists and people should be grateful,
    not bickering about a handful of blueprints that must seem a small prize compared
    to the fantastic gains made by everyone.\u2019.   \n  \nBut not everyone see things
    in the same light as Gariushi. The Gallente Federation for one is absolutely outraged,
    not only at the blueprint theft but also the offensive attitude of the Caldari.
    The Senate has already pulled the plug on further funding and the Gallente science
    community on the facility is in a total uproar. Several sections of the facility
    have already been closed down and more will close soon. Staff has left the station
    in droves to take up work elsewhere. In short, it is a total turmoil that may
    very well spell the end of the Crielere program and all the revolutionary work
    done there."
