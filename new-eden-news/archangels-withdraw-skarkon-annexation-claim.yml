- body: "Skarkon \u2013 After weeks of holding a symbolic grip on the planet of Skarkon
    II, the Archangels unexpectedly withdrew their claim to the Minmatar Republic
    world and all but disappeared from the system. The Republic Fleet has reportedly
    discovered dozens of abandoned deadspace facilities, control towers, and even
    moon colonies, all with evidence that the pirate cartel left in great haste. In
    addition to leaving valuable equipment behind, \"massive quantities\" of illegal
    contraband were also found. No explanation was provided by the Archangels except
    for a tersely worded communiqu\xE9 to the CONCORD Bureau that all \"territorial
    claims to the system are to be considered void and rescinded\". \n\nThe Archangel\u2019s
    sudden departure amidst a period of acute turmoil within the Minmatar Republic
    has left Republic Fleet officials scrambling for an explanation. Many expected
    the pirate cartel to exploit Midular\u2019s troubles to the greatest extent possible.
    Rumors are circulating that the Starkmanir discovery is the reason for the sudden
    departure, but these claims cannot be verified."
