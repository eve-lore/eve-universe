- body: "A joint taskforce of Gallente and Minmatar militias engaged a State Protectorate
    fleet in Abune this evening. The Federal Defence fleet led by Elijah Ghost, and
    the Tribal Liberation fleet commander Lady Karuni, agreed to collaborate on an
    operation to destroy their common enemy. \n\nBefore the final engagement, several
    tactical scenarios were discussed in private comm channels between commanders.
    A course of action was decided that would provide the best possible chance to
    destroy the Caldari fleet, which numbered some 130 pilots. Of course we are not
    authorized to discuss classified tactical plans, but the action itself was later
    deemed a success. \n\nDue to a system-wide spatial anomaly, sensor and module
    control failures prevented most pilots from utilizing their equipment fully. Despite
    the setback, over a dozen enemy ships were dispatched and the rest scattered,
    before the Tribal fleet and Federal fleet were forced to withdraw. \n\nFurther
    combined efforts are expected as our allies begin to work with us."
