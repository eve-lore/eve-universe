- body: In a surprise statement released today, the Aidonis Foundation has revealed
    the next receiver of the coveted Aidonis Statue. The Statue is rewarded annually
    to those that have contributed greatly to inter-stellar peace and improved empire
    relations. This is the first time the Statue is awarded to a national leader still
    in power, but most political analysts agree that Heideran more than deserves the
    award, as he is without doubt the main reason for the thaw in relations between
    the empires in recent years and, hence, the fabulous prosperity now enjoyed by
    everyone throughout the world of EVE.
