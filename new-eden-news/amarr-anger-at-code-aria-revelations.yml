    statement today on behalf of the Amarr Empire to voice their position regarding
    the [leaked Code Aria report]( http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=1808&tid=4)
    and the information released by CONCORD's Inner Circle [at the last Assembly session
    yesterday]( http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=1877&tid=6). \n\n\"Let
    it be known that the blatant breaches of security and protocol on the part of
    CONCORD that have recently come to light are considered by our government to be
    an extreme violation of the organisation's charter with all four empires, which
    shakes the very foundations of trust between our peoples. By withholding crucial
    data concerning the unauthorised gate activations the Amarr Empire has been gravely
    insulted, and the safety of millions of our loyal citizens has been placed in
    jeopardy.\" \n\nLord Qumar went on to highlight the connection between the Code
    Aria Inquiry and the disasters that befell the Gallente Federation's past Artificial
    Intelligence programs over two decades ago. \n\n\u201CWe have not forgotten that
    the Gallente Federation was responsible for building the jump gates referenced
    in the Code Aria report. Not to mention the apparent and evidently dangerous escalation
    of technological advances in the Artificial Intelligence field, a few of which
    are documented to have potentially gone awry in the past when left irresponsibly
    unchecked. The Gallente Federation's continued carelessness has been instrumental
    in the current state of affairs, where good citizens of all four empires must
    be constantly vigilant against the threat of the Rogue Drone menace. Had the Gallente
    Federation been more forthcoming regarding their reasons for handing responsibility
    of the gates to CONCORD in the first place, then things today may have been very
    different.\" \n\nLord Qumar closed his address and declined to take any questions
    on the matter. Commentators have noted that the tone of the statement bodes ill
    not just for CONCORD, but for Amarr-Gallente relations too, and it will be interesting
    to see how the Federation chooses to respond."
