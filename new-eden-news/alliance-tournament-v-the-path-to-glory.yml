    and event officials have now released details of what awaits the victors. \n\nThis
    year the teams entering the competition can choose a faction of their choice to
    honor, support and promote. If the team then reaches the final three they will
    be rewarded by their chosen faction. \n\nShould a competitor choose to remain
    recluse and not honor any faction, they will be rewarded with a choice of limited
    edition faction hardware. \n\nA number of GalNet observers have been vocal in
    their disapproval of this years awards. In previous years when the tournament
    was run by the Caldari Gaming Commission, the State poured ISK into the prize
    fund and many unique and relatively rare (at the time) vessels were gifted. The
    State also collaborated with the other empires to ensure a range of different
    prizes was available. \n\nThe faction equipment available for victors at this
    years event should not be dismissed as it is still a worthy prize. However it
    has been pointed out that in terms of ISK value it does not approach previous
    tournament winnings. Recently a previous tournament prize, the Republic Tribal
    Issue \"Storm\" Tempest, was valued at between 85 and 100 billion ISK. \n\nUnlike
    past events it is not expected that any rare ships will be given out although
    it should be noted that this has not yet been confirmed either way by officials.
    \n\nThe question now is which, if any, faction will the teams chose to honor?
    Who will win the tournament trophy and which team will proudly display their gold
    medals? \n\nThe start is rapidly approaching, only one team will be victorious,
    the fight for glory is upon us. \n\n_External GalNet References_  \n[The Official
