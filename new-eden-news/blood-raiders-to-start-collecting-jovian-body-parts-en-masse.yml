- body: "Sources within the Blood Raider Covenant have revealed that their leader,
    Omir Sarikusa, has commanded his followers to start collecting Jovian body parts,
    making it their primary priority. CONCORD has put their forces close to Blood
    Raider space on high alert, as they expect escalation in raiding activity into
    empire space. However, CONCORD authorities stress that space farers should not
    be excessively alarmed, as the Blood Raiders are only expected to make small-scale
    runs into empire space with a specific target in mind. Thus, activity should only
    increase within Blood Raider space, as their ships return carrying \u2018liberated\u2019
    body parts.   \n  \nSarikusa, in his order, does not go into details for why he
    wants the body parts, though one can only assume he intends to use them for one
    of the ghastly rituals the Blood Raiders are so infamous for. Or perhaps Sarikusa
    has some contact with the Jovians and is hoping to cull their favor for himself.
    Certainly no right-minded pilot would want to see Blood Raider fleets boosted
    with Jovian technology terrorize space."
