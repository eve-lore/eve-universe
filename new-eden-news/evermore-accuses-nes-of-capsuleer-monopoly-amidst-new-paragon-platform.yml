    EverMore Accuses NES of Capsuleer Monopoly Amidst New Paragon Platform Rumors\n\nYulai,
    Genesis - EverMore has filed a legal appeal with the Secure Commerce Commission
    calling for an investigation into the New Eden Store for antitrust violations.
    According to EverMore, the NES\u2019s commissary contract with the Society of
    Conscious Thought is an effective monopoly on capsuleer services. Following this
    news, an anonymous source within EverMore has revealed that Paragon, an EverMore
    subsidiary, is developing a new artistic platform for capsuleers.\n\nIRIS, Paragon's
    AI liaison, has declined to confirm or deny the development of a new platform,
    or any possible connection with the appeal. \u201CParagon development is on a
    journey to help our capsuleer partners \u2018be more\u2019,\u201D IRIS stated
    at a press conference held in Paragon\u2019s headquarters in Ourapheh. \u201CI\u2019m
    so glad that this is just as exciting for you as it is for us, but you will have
    to wait a little longer before we reveal our next destination. As for the NES,
    our parent company is founded on a promise to \u2018bring all things to all people\u2019.
    Non-competitive behavior is a barrier that restricts our ability to fulfill that
    promise to our partners.\u201D\n\nThe NES has held an exclusive commissary contract
    with the SOCT since YC118. The contract was initially issued for skill trading
    products but has expanded to cover a wide range of services. The NES is run by
    a board comprised of representatives from numerous notable corporations.\n\nNo
    official response by the NES has been made. However, board member Ganortchar Asabona
    accused EverMore\u2019s President Alexander Ducasse of \u201Cpetty bullying tactics\u201D
    when speaking with reporters outside his home in Khanid Prime I earlier today.
    He went on to accuse EverMore of \u201Cusing their Cromeaux lackeys to spy on
    NES board meetings and bolster their fraudulent claims\u201D. Cromeaux Inc., which
    EverMore purchased a controlling interest in last year, has held seats on the
    NES board since its foundation. Their CEO Daphnie Fonterouche has declined to
    comment on the accusation, but sources close to Alexander Ducasse have informed
    the Scope that he is taking legal advice on a possible defamation lawsuit against
    Asabona.\n\n### News in Brief\n\n- Break-in discovered at GRNJ-3 Intaki Space

    in partnership with Mordu's Legion.\n\n- AIR Laboratories is preparing to publish
