- body: 'YULAI - CONCORD has issued a status report on the ongoing "Rogue Swarm Alert"
    noting the destruction of over a million rogue swarm nests so far and commending
    the high response from capsuleers in the campaign to remove the widespread infestation
    from New Eden.


    In a press briefing at Directive Enforcement Department HQ, Brigadier General
    Odo Korachi highlighted the "heroic efforts" of many capsuleers, noting that a
    significant number of capsuleers had individually taken part in the destruction
    of several hundred rogue swarm nests each. General Korachi also pointed out that
    so far approximately 50,000 pilots have responded to the threat posed by the rogue
    swarm.


    The briefing also confirmed that rogue swarm nests have been found and destroyed
    throughout New Eden and even within the "W-space" network of wormhole connected
    star systems. While most efforts have focused on removing the threat from high-
    and low-security space, CONCORD analysts note several hundred thousand nests have
    been eliminated in the null-sec outer regions and W-space.


    Concluding his remarks, General Korachi stated, "CONCORD and the Rogue Swarm Alert
    Command Group are now confident that this highly distributed rogue swarm will
    be dispersed as its core Overmind network is dismantled by the outstanding work
    of the capsuleers responding to the alert."


    The Rogue Swarm Alert continues and the Scope will continue to report on developments.'
