    - Khanid Innovation and Modern Finances have announced that they now own a controlling
    stake in the Khanid Kingdom's largest investment bank, Samarkand Financial. The
    move, which is the culmination of two months of negotiations, gives Modern Finances
    an even stronger presence in the Khanid Kingdom and secures a strong financial
    partner for Khanid Innovation, one of today's most powerful Khanid corporations.\n\nSamarkand
    Financial has been a large player in the Khanid financial sector for over three
    decades now, but until recently has had little presence outside the Kingdom. Last
    year marked its biggest departure from that strategy when the company helped to
    finance the stock purchase that propelled Mens Reppola to the CEO position at
    Ishukone in April.  It was that purchase that brought the company to the attention
    of Modern Finances.\n\n\"Modern Finances has always looked to the Khanid Kingdom
    as a growth market,\" said CEO Alasunda Yeki. \"This partnership with Khanid Innovation
    and Samarkand Financial ensures that we will have a strong presence in the Kingdom
    for the long term.\"\n\nKhanid Innovation CEO Ganortchar Asabona said that the
    deal is part of a larger strategy for the company. \"Khanid Innovation has been
    a leader in the technology sector since our founding, but our goals have always
    been to become a leader in innovation cluster-wise. This partnership is another
    step toward that goal.\"\n\nThe two CEOs made it clear they had no intention to
    upset the current leadership of Samarkand Financial, saying that they would be
    keeping the executive board intact. \"We bought the company because of its success
    and we see no reason to change up a winning team,\" explained Yeki."
