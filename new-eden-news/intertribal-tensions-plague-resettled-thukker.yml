    - Ethnic violence broke out today in the normally quiet town of Hrangsdor, as
    the predominantly Brutor community reacted to the presence of resettled Thukker
    members of the Fuldis caravan.\n\nFormerly nomadic, nearly half of the members
    of the Fuldis caravan opted to form a permanent settlement last fall, choosing
    Ryddinjorn as their new home. Since that time, the lukewarm welcome has turned
    to outright suspicion, culminating in today's outbreak of widespread vandalism
    and protests.\n\nMany residents are suspicious of the Thukkers' motives for settling
    down. \"Everyone knows that the Thukker will adopt anyone,\" said Amadou Zoreya,
    a local Brutor man. \"They come here, fill our kids' heads full of wild stories
    about deep space, and lure them into their caravans. It's not right.\"\n\nThese
    Thukker maintain that their nomadic days are behind them, however. \"We just want
    to fit in,\" said Emmen Ulffsson, one of the resettled Thukker. \"We want to live
    our lives and prosper just like everyone else.\"\n\nBut the cultural divisions
    go deeper. During the Amarr occupation, the pragmatic Thukker viewed mobility
    as the best defense against enslavement. But to proud Brutor tribesmen, this same
    mobility was viewed as tantamount to cowardice. Raelan Kahoku, a Hrangsdor Brutor
    elder said simply, \"I would rather die fighting than flee into space,\" and it
    seems this sentiment is widely shared.\n\nAuthorities have brought the situation
    in Hrangsdor under control, but the violence has left many Thukker once again
    contemplating relocation. Lamented Ulffsson, \"Maybe our nomadic days aren't quite
    over yet.\""
