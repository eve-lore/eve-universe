- body: The Department of Education in the Gallente Federation has announced that
    it has made a breakthrough deal with the Sukuuvestaa Corporation to supply all
    Gallentean schools with Protein Delicacies. The deal is thought to save the department
    billions of ISK that can then be used in other areas of the education system.
    Protein Delicacies have already become widely popular within the Federation and
    the government is certain the students will applaud the change of diet in their
    cafeterias. Sukuuvesta Corporation has already stepped up its production and the
    first shipment will arrive at schools all over the Federation no later than early
    next week. On a grimmer note the arrival of the Protein Delicacies has slashed
    food imports from the Amarr Empire into the Federation and spokespeople for the
    Amarrian agricultural sector have issued severe warnings about the future of the
    industry. They also lament that the Federation should choose artificial food products
    instead of the clean, organically grown foodstuff that the Amarrians produce.
