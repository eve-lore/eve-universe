    Theology Council has decided against hearing and ruling on the transcranial microcontroller
    controversy. The Council released a short statement explaining the ruling.  \n
    \ \n\"The issue of slave control is one left up to a Holder and his slave drivers.
    It is not the position of the Theology Council to step in and mandate what methods
    are and are not acceptable. A broad, sweeping declaration on the issue would ignore
    the many unique issues involved in owning and caring for slaves. There are times
    when the devices may be appropriate, and times when they are not.  \n  \n\"Any
    ruling the Council made, even if made moderately, would invariably seem to be
    an endorsement of one viewpoint. For that reason, we leave the matter to the Holders
    to decide for themselves.\"  \n  \nWhile it is not unusual for the Theology Council
    to decline hearing matters it considers unworthy of review, many experts belive
    the decision came because of splits inside the Council that threatened to undermine
    any ruling. \"There were nearly as many justices against as there were for,\"
    stated someone familiar with the situation who wished to remain anonymous. \"Should
    the Council have heard the issue, it would have erupted into something much, much
    larger.\""
