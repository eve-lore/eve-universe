- body: "The immense Tal-Romon Cathedral has been safely transported piece by piece
    from Eclipticum to Amarr Prime, where it will be reconstructed on the Amarr continent
    itself. The cathedral debate pitted the Amarr Emperor Doriam II against the royal
    heir Catiz Tash-Murkon, who was the previous owner of the cathedral before the
    emperor confiscated it. Though the Tash-Murkon family did not openly oppose the
    emperor on the matter it is well known that they supported private efforts to
    foil the transportation efforts.   \n  \nA spokesperson for the Imperial Chancellor
    stated that 'this success speaks volume about what Amarrians can accomplish when
    they work together towards a common goal. I hope this encourages Amarrians everywhere
    to follow their dreams, as they will surely have the grace of God with them in
    all their endeavors.'   \n  \nThe massive undertaking saw hundreds of private
    pilots rally to the cause, completing a staggering ten thousand sorties for the
    greater good of the empire. This despite several thousand failed sorties due to
    attacks from unsavory assailants working indirectly for Catiz Tash-Murkon. Now
    all that remains to be seen is whether the emperor and the fiery heir can sheath
    their swords and establish some sort of a status quo. The odds are this will happen
    as the Amarrians have a long history of finding compromise solutions to thwart
    civil wars. But they also have a long history of personal vendettas."
