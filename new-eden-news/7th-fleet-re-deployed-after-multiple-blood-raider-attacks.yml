- body: 'THE BLEAK LANDS - A statement from the Office of Press for the Amarr Navy
    has confirmed that a ''significant'' number of forces have been re-deployed to
    the Sasen and Vaarma constellations after several attacks on Imperial assets in
    the last twelve hours.


    It is believed that the attacks began in Kamela, with its third and eighth planet
    assaulted simultaneously and a number of religious sites desecrated during heavy
    fighting between local Imperial ground forces and a large contingent of Blood
    Raiders assault troops. The highest profile of these attacks was on Kamela III,
    where the family crypt of the planet''s holder was razed and the adjoining cathedral''s
    chancel and altar became an execution site for more than a hundred local clergy
    members.


    After Imperial reinforcements arrived several hours ago to mount a defensive assault
    and assess the situation, it is believed that almost four thousand more local
    residents of the area are reported missing, having been seized by Blood Raider
    Forces.


    In the hours after the attacks in Kamela, further details of a large scale assault
    on Huola VII, as well as assaults on several orbital facilities in Sosala and
    Anka have been reported with a further two thousand confirmed missing.


    The Amarr Navy and Ministry Of Internal Order released a joint statement a little
    over an hour ago, confirming that a task force from the famed "Saracens" 7th Fleet
    has been deployed to the two constellations in order to re-secure the area.'
