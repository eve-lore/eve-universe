- body: "Late last night the fugitive Caldari scientists, Albert Vance and Vic Stats,
    broadcast what was ultimately a failed test of their prototype mind control device
    using the Caldari ftl communication channel. \n\nCaldari State pilots, engaging
    in typical Caldari pod pilot banter, were surprised by the appearance of the ident
    code of Albert Vance in the monitored Caldari channels late yesterday evening.
    The scientists, fresh from a close encounter with pursuing authorities last week,
    announced to the galaxy that the first test of their recently completed Mind Control
    Device would be conducted and broadcasted live for all to see. This was where
    the experiment first began to go astray when Stats, hunting through their available
    test subjects for a terminally ill and therefore expendable specimen, was surprised
    by Vance who decided that he \u201Cneed[ed] a healthy specimen\u201D in order
    to gather the most accurate data possible. Unfortunately for Stats, he was the
    only healthy specimen in the vicinity, and before he was able to mount much of
    a defensive argument Vance initiated the first test cycle of the device. Caldari
    pilots watched on with horror as the device, initially functioning within parameters,
    began to suffer a number of increasingly catastrophic failures until the prototype
    failed, ultimately leaving both it and Stats' mind in pieces. The transmission
    was quickly severed at the source, but not before relieved observers were able
    to witness signs of life emanating from the hapless Stats, though some pilots
    reported that Stats appeared slow, disoriented and had a significant slur to his
    speech. Caldari authorities refused to comment on whether or not their technicians
    were able to trace the location of the broadcast.\n\nMeanwhile, the application
    to Interbus to have Vance and Stats banned from travel on board their inter-system
    transports is currently under consideration, and Caldari authorities remain hopeful
    that Interbus will both respond positively and quickly, so that the pursuit team
    lead by Pete Sance can corner and apprehend them before Vance is able to complete
    his inevitable reconstruction of the device."
