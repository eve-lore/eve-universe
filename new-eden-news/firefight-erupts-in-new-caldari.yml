- body: "In an unusual turn of events, Caldari corporation infighting erupted into
    a bloody public spectacle as Terra Infinitus' flagship was attacked and destroyed
    in front of shocked onlookers in the New Caldari system. The ship and is escorts
    had previously come under attack in the Jan system, and it appears the battleship
    was attempting to escape several ambushes. Unconfirmed reports indicate that several
    pilots lost ships as the fleet defended itself.   \n  \nSurprisingly, automated
    CONCORD defences failed to respond and eliminate the assaulting craft at any time,
    raising concerns over the reliability of the system. CONCORD at this time has
    no comment about the incident, other than it is investigating.   \n  \nOne pilot,
    who preferred not to be identified, has stated that a mysterious figure known
    as Carth Joran of Perkone corporation was responsible for the hire of the pilots,
    to recover several starcharts from the flagship. However, records and statements
    from Perkone indicate that they have no \"Carth Joran\" working for them, and
    a CONCORD database search has yielded no result.   \n  \nInvestigations into this
    shady character continue."
