    Law School station orbiting the second moon of Maturat IX, a ceremonial procession
    turned ugly, with a Khumaak at the center of yet another conflict. Bokm Wuk, a
    Brutor student studying at the law school, refused to hand over his Khumaak to
    security personnel. After repeated requests, Wuk brandished the Khumaak and was
    shot by one of the security personnel with what is commonly called a \u201Clull
    gun.\u201D Though usually non-lethal, the discharged round struck Wuk in the neck
    and has resulted in his hospitalization. He is expected to recover. \n\nThe student
    group which led the procession is calling for the resignation of the head of security
    for the Maturat IX 2 station, a demand officials there discredit as unreasonable
    and extreme. \u201CThe security officers involved were acting under orders to
    keep the peace. We have forty-seven thousand fulltime residents here. We are tasked
    with their safety, as well as with ensuring the continuing operation of all station
    facilities,\u201D said Gusiko Or, a Republic Justice administrator stationed at
    Maturat IX 2. \u201CWe acknowledge the explosive nature of this issue, but we
    stand behind the actions of our security personnel.\u201D \n\nWhen asked to address
    complaints that the guard who fired the weapon was Sebiestor, Or, of Brutor heritage,
    dismissed the question. \u201CIn the performance of our duties to Republic Justice,
    we are all one tribe, one clan, and one family. Personal beliefs have no part
    in this.\u201D After a long pause, he continued, \u201CThe beliefs of the security
    officers involved in this incident, though a private matter, would surprise many
    of their current critics.\u201D \n\nUnofficial sources are more candid. A member
    of the security detachment present at the scene of the incident, speaking under
    conditions of anonymity, said that even though the security forces at Maturat
    IX 2 are majority Sebiestor, many of them do not agree with the PM\u2019s proposed
    ban of the Khumaak, and do not see it as a tribal issue. \u201CI think the idea
    that this symbol belongs to one tribe\u2014or even one gender\u2014is ridiculous.
    The Khumaak is our common heritage. We don\u2019t agree with the proposed ban,
    and we didn\u2019t want to confront the students, but we have orders, and our
    first duty is to the Republic.\u201D \n\nLull guns, used in riot control situations,
    deploy a semi-soft spongiform cylindrical projectile. Sealed pockets in the projectile
    contain various sedative or tranquilizing agents, designed to be released as an
    aerosol mist when the projectile hits its target. The guns are meant to be aimed
    low, at the ground beneath rioters or at their legs. When the projectile hit Wuk
    in the neck and throat, he suffered several broken vertebrae and a near-fatal
    overdose of the chemical agent used in the projectile. \n\nThe discharging of
    the weapon above waist height was probably a mistake, says Gusiko Or. \u201COf
    course we are still reviewing the incident, but all of our security officers are
    trained in the proper use of lull guns and other anti-riot equipment. Perhaps
    the officer, confronted with a very real physical threat, panicked and momentarily
    forgot his training. I am certain it was not an intentional misuse of the weapon.\u201D
    \n\nThe holiday, an observance of the death anniversary of a legendary Minmatar
    scholar, is usually celebrated with a procession ending in the \u201Cchasing of
    the kirrik,\u201D a ritualized game involving the rapid exchange of wooden carvings
    of a kirikk, a type of migratory songbird found in variation all over Matar. In
    legend, the scholar Emnet experienced several breakthrough discoveries shortly
    after chasing a small flock of the songbirds out of a tree near his study, where
    they proved a distraction with their constant chirping. \n\nThe holiday, usually
    a lighthearted occasion, is customarily celebrated by students and scholars, but
    the legend can also be interpreted as a sort of chasing away of lies or mistaken
    ideas (the kirikk is named for its call, which sounds similar to a Sebeistor word
    for \u201Cerror\u201D or \u201Cimperfection.\u201D) During the continuing Khumaak
    controversy, many are finding a special resonance in this aspect of the holiday."
