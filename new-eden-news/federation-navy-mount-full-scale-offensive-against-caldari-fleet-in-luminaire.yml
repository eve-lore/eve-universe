- body: 'BREAKING NEWS - The Federation Navy task force seen entering Luminaire approximately
    30 minutes ago has engaged the Leviathan-class titan _Shiigeru_ and her support
    fleet in orbit of Caldari Prime.


    The news spread across the entire Federation in minutes, with every GalNET channel
    currently broadcasting announcing breaking news in order to cut to footage of
    the ongoing engagement in orbit. Businesses across the Federation are beginning
    to close early, and planet side traffic in many major cities across the regions
    of Essence, Verge Vendor and Placid has ground to a halt as billboards cut to
    footage of the Federation Navy assault.


    When contacted regarding the ongoing operation, Scope News military advisor Francois
    Mirelle initially appeared lost for words, before concluding that  "there is no
    doubt about it. This has to be a premeditated and planned assault to take back
    control of Caldari Prime. This could possibly be the largest offensive undertaken
    by the Federation Navy since the end of the war in YC12."


    The aggression by the Federation Navy comes without any form of prior contact
    with the Caldari Navy during the course of the day and is being described by tactical
    experts as a "full scale frontal offensive against the blockade of Caldari Prime."


    The office of press for the Federation Navy remains closed for comment at this
    point, and the CONCORD Assembly has issued a full travel advisory for the Luminaire
    system. The content of the travel advisory includes the warning that any pilot
    who ventures into the Luminaire system has no guarantee of safety and will be
    flagged as a global suspect.


    The Directive Enforcement Department are advising all capsuleers to stay clear
    of the Luminaire system, and have officially confirmed that the CONCORD Assembly
    will accept no liability for loss of life or property until such time as the situation
    is brought under control.'
