    Yoiul Festival and the official CONCORD holiday season is in full swing in CONCORD
    City. In light of the ongoing Rogue Swarm Alert, the residential and commercial
    hub of CONCORD''s sovereign territories does have an elevated security posture,
    with its heavily upgraded space, air and ground defense networks at maximum alert
    as the population swells during the holiday season.


    In New Eden, celebrations of the end of year in New Eden''s shared Yoiul Conference
    calendar are at their highest in the Gallente Federation and Minmatar Republic.
    Festivities are more muted in the Amarr Empire and Caldari State but are most
    evident in the capital, space-industrial and financial centers such as the Jita
    and Amarr systems.


    The DED has stated that it is satisfied with the rate at which Rogue Swarm outbreaks
    and nests are being dealt with by freelance capsuleers answering the call of the
    Agency''s task listing. Despite the festivities, it is not only the DED that is
    hard at work over the season. Some CONCORD and SCC officials are also preparing
    for their ten-yearly administrative and financial census of New Eden.


    Additionally, CONCORD''s Project Discovery division is preparing to review the
    calculation and sychronization of the New Eden timebase for purposes of its exoplanet
    hunting efforts.'
