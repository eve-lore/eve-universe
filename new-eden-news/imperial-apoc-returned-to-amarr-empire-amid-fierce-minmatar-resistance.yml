- body: "Last Sunday saw the systems of Kador Prime and Boranai light up in struggle
    as the Ionstar corporation moved the now-famous Imperial-issue Apocalypse to its
    home. In a procession described by onlookers as \u201Cworthy of the Amarr navy
    itself,\u201D loyalist paramilitary squads from the Curatores Veritatis Alliance
    escorted the prize vessel through Amarr space, coming in contact with a massed
    suicide squad of Minmatar revolutionaries at Kador Prime\u2019s Boranai gate.
    \  \n  \nThe next few minutes saw a fiercely fought pitched battle between dozens
    of Minmatar frigates and Amarr battleships, the Imperial Apocalypse\u2019s shields
    taking blow after blow from the hail of Minmatar cruise missiles but ultimately
    holding up through the efforts of its brave pilot and dedicated team of shield-transferring
    support ships. Scope correspondent Helaata Avril, present at the Boranai gate
    at time of battle, said the scene had been \u201Cone of such incredible carnage
    I doubt the galaxy\u2019s seen anything like it since the Gallente-Caldari war.\u201D
    Over eighty starships were reportedly destroyed in the battle\u2019s short time
    span, and amid the showers of fire and metal the Imperial Apocalypse managed to
    escape unscathed.   \n  \nArriving at Amarr, the procession was greeted by Amarr
    Navy Chief of Staff Ravin Mehnih, who, after a speech declaring the Empire\u2019s
    gratitude towards the Ionstar Corporation, formally accepted the Apocalypse and,
    on behalf of the Imperial Chancellor, awarded the prestigious Cross of the Sacred
    Throne to Ionstar pilot Clone 0, who navigated the vessel on the dangerous journey,
    and PIE fleet commander and CEO Golan Trevize, who oversaw the escort operation.
    \  \n  \nThe Amarr Empire has officially declared the Ionstar corporation to be
    friends of the Empire, and wishes it to be known that their loyalty and devotion
    to their Emperor will not be forgotten."
