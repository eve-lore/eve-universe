- body: "**Long live the emperor!**\n\nFollowing Ecliptical's stunning display in
    the championships, the imperial succession committee came out with the following
    declaration after only an hour of contemplation: \n\n_\"It is our solemn duty
    to testify that Dorian Kor-Azor has indeed bestowed divine strength unto his champion,
    and thus led him to victory over his peers_. _This prooves beyond a shadow of
    a doubt that Doriam is the rightful emperor and leader of the Amarr people. Our
    sole function is now to see that the rightful emperor is crowned, and to inform
    the other heirs that they will be expected to give their lives for the good of
    Amarr at his coronation.\"_\n\nCelebrations, which are expected to last for days,
    immediately broke out in house Kor-Azor and amongst all the followers of Dorian's
    liberal views. \n\nDoriam's reaction was both humble and exultant. \n\n_\"Today
    is a great day for the house of Kor-Azor and all of Amarr. Yet I am filled with
    sorrow. Still, my heart bleeds for the loss of our beloved Heideran, whose wisdom
    was surely divine. I grieve for my fellow heirs, who must rightly set aside their
    lives for the good of us all.\"_   \n  \n_\"Now is the time to set aside our difference
    and embrace a new and stronger Amarr - an Amarr like the divine Heideran believed
    in. I will not fail you.\"_\n\nCongratulations from all over the world have been
    sent to the emperor-to-be, including from most of the other houses.   \n_\"It
    is god's will.\"_ said Idonis Ardishapur only moments after the results came in.
    \n\nOther heirs were less vocal, but none as silent as Jamyl Sarum, who did not
    send her regards to Doriam."
