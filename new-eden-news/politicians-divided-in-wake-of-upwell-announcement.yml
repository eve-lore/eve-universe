    Politicians Divided in Wake of Upwell Announcement\n\nUpwell commercials announcing
    the consortium's future plans have led to political unrest across New Eden. The
    commercials reveal a new, affordable cloning program. While many details remain
    unclear, it seems that consciousness transfer to the new clones will be offered
    in exchange for Upwell labor contracts.\n\nThe commercials bring to light the
    truth behind leaked communications between Upwell and the Amarr Empire, Caldari
    State, Gallente Federation, and Minmatar Republic. Reactions to the news have
    been varied, with divisions across different lines in all four governments.\n\n###
    Gallente Federation: President Aguard Welcomes Innovation\n\nPresident Aguard
    was the first to respond, praising Upwell\u2019s program at a Senate debate. Many
    present applauded as the President lauded Upwell\u2019s \u201Cinnovative use of
    technology to offer a brighter future to the people of New Eden.\u201D She went
    on to describe how new cloning technologies could offer a way out for the Federation\u2019s
    disenfranchised.\n\nLabor Populist critics of the program have accused the President
    of attempting to head off a mounting unemployment crisis. According to the Labor
    Populists, Aguard\u2019s Automated Industry for Democracy Act has resulted in
    lost jobs throughout the Federation. They now accuse her of embracing Upwell\u2019s
    plans as a quick fix to the issue, without having considered the need for ethical
    safeguards.\n\n### Caldari State: Plan Condemned by Ocean Faction Meagecorps\n\nOfficial
    communications were sent to workers of the Ishukone, Hyasyoda, and Wiyrkomi megacorporations
    two weeks ago calling Upwell\u2019s new program \u201Ca betrayal of the Caldari
    principles.\u201D Following the release of Upwell's recruitment commercials, they
    have reasserted their condemnation; \u201CUpwell\u2019s proposals do not honor
    the people they would recruit, but reduce them to mere cogs. Duty to your Caldari
    corporation, and loyalty to the State, remain the clearest paths to an honorable
    life. These principles are directly incompatible with Upwell colonization.\u201D
    \n\nThese megacorporations, all members of the Ocean Faction alliance, have begun
    lobbying to ban Upwell\u2019s new clone transfers ahead of a Chief Executive Board
    hearing next week. \n\nNo official statement has been forthcoming from the Board
    so far. In contrast to the Ocean faction\u2019s rejection of the program, members
    of the Forest Faction (Lai Dai, CBD, and Nugoeihuvi) have been meeting with Upwell
    representatives to discuss details. It seems likely that it will be up to the
    Mountain Faction (Sukuuvestaa and Kaalakiota) to break the tie.\n\n### Minmatar
    Republic: Sanmatar Remains Neutral as Tribes Divided\n\nA rare public assembly
    was held by the Tribal Council to debate Upwell\u2019s program. Sebiestor Tribal
    Chief, Acassa Midular, implored the Republic to \u201Cembrace the opportunities
    this new technology offers\u201D. This was met with outrage by Brutor Tribal Chief
    Wkumi Pol who declared, \u201CWe did not cast aside the yoke of Imperial oppression
    to voluntarily place a noose made of corporate greed around our necks\u201D.\n\nThe
    Starkmanir Chief, Jeoran Setul, backed the Brutor, adding that the Upwell initiative
    was a threat to Matari identity. Vherokoir Chief, Isardsund Urbrald, rejected
    the Starkmanir\u2019s claims, stating that \u201Cthe spirit of Matar is inside
    us no matter what face we wear.\u201D \n\nSanmatar Maleatu Shakor remained neutral
    throughout the proceedings. His failure to condemn the plan outright has been
    criticized by members of the Brutor and Starkmanir tribes, his traditional supporters.\n\nAfter
    a long and heated debate, no conclusion was reached by the Tribal Council. A second
    session will take place behind closed doors in the coming days.\n\n### Amarr Empire:
    Concerned Houses Await Empress' Ruling\n\nThe most notable absence from the Upwell
    debate is the voice of Empress Catiz I, who has yet to make an announcement on
    the topic. According to official channels, the Empress is \u201Cconsidering all
    possible implications, both spiritual and fiscal.\u201D\n\nMeanwhile, the Amarr
    royal houses have largely positioned themselves in opposition to the new technology.
    Lord Arim Ardishapur has led the charge in an impassioned proclamation on the
    value of tradition, stating that \u201Cthe faithful know that Grace is the only
    reward worth pursuing.\u201D This statement has received support from the houses
    Kor-Azor, Sarum, and Kador. House Tash-Murkon remains silent on the issue.\n\nOnly
    the Khanid have come out in favor of the program. The Khanid Kingdom even hosted
    an official delegation of Upwell representatives at the royal palace on Khanid
    Prime. Sources inside the palace report that the nature of the cloning technology
    was discussed, and found to be amenable.\n\n### News in Brief\n\n- Capsuleer-led
    exploration of collapsed conduits underway according to SOCT.\n\n- EDENCOM teams
    are yet to report back from Abyssal explorations.\n\n- Paragon hosts artists'
    retreat in Ourapheh.\n\n- Gallente Primacy responsible for thwarted attack on
    Intaki metro service.\n\n- CONCORD issues condemnation of Ashes of Turnur as group
    grows in popularity beyond Republic borders."
