- body: "Last night, a small scale operation conducted by Caldari Navy Special Forces
    led to the capture of Bleak Scarab, a terrorist with known connections to the
    Guristas pirates. During the past years Bleak Scarab, whose real name is Yaila
    Heeth, has gained access to classified information, while working undercover as
    a Caldari Navy Courier. The information she has gathered was supposedly to be
    used in acts of terrorism on assets of the Caldari State.   \n  \nHer arrest was
    made possible by an anonymous informant whose lead pointed the Caldari Navy in
    her direction. Miss Heeth was caught manipulating several jump gates in the Lonetrek
    region, confirming suspicions of espionage. Following her capture, where the Caldari
    Navy Forces were met with little resistance, Miss Heath was questioned and moved
    to a secure location pending her prosecution."
