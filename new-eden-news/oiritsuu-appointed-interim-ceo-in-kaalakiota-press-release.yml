- body: 'NONNI - [Kaalakiota](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Kaalakiota) has announced
    this morning that [Haatakan Oiritsuu](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Haatakan_Oiritsuu),
    former KK Chief Executive, has been temporarily reinstated to oversee the process
    of re-stabilizing the corporation.


    In the statement, read by Oiritsuu herself in front of KK headquarters an hour
    before the Kimotoro Stock Exchange opened, she pledged to "return the corporation
    to financial stability after over half a decade of fiscally abusive and negligent
    rule by the [Caldari Providence Directorate](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari_Providence_Directorate)."


    Regarded by many as the face of Kaalakiota for decades before she was ousted in
    a hostile takeover by the Provist movement in YC110, the reappointment of Oiritsuu
    comes as no surprise to many business analysts, both within the [State](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari_State)
    and externally.


    Ursinen Tovari, a market analyst for [Modern Finances](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Modern_Finances)
    based in Nourvukaiken, expressed his elation with her reinstatement saying, "We
    are a resilient people; we have proven this in the last half decade under Provist
    rule. The time is coming for the State to shine again as the leading economic
    superpower in the cluster and to do this we must place those with the best knowledge
    in the right places. Kaalakiota have made the definitive choice with Oiritsuu."


    Kaalakiota''s stock saw a small rise in value at the open of trade, after Oiritsuu''s
    statement during her first public appearance since the funeral of Admiral Visera
    Yanala earlier this month. Many business analysts are calling this the first major
    positive movement for KK''s value in three quarters, with stock value expected
    to remain stable at close of trade today.'
