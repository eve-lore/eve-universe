    Caldari, The Forge** - Late last week, Sansha's Nation vessels commanded by Citizen
    Astur invaded New Caldari and sieged the entrance gate to Jita.  \n  \nOn 21.7.113
    at around 13:15 New Eden time, two wormholes formed in New Caldari close to the
    jumpgate leading into Jita and spewed out at least two dozen Sansha's Nation frigates.
    \ \n  \nKoja Tsutariba from the State Protectorate replied with an emergency request
    for capsuleer assistance in the surrounding systems.  \n  \nJita, the largest
    trade hub in New Eden, is usually bustling with as many as a thousand capsuleers.
    A number of these capsuleers answered the call within minutes, rushing over to
    New Caldari. Ice Shard was one of them: \"I read [the emergency request] in local
    and was not afraid, it was a good challenge.\"  \n  \nA quickly growing fleet
    easily dispatched the Sansha frigates, only to encounter approximately 20 Sansha
    battleships emerging from the wormhole. The capsuleer fleet, counting over 100
    pilots by now, suffered some losses but killed the initial Sansha battleship fleet.
    \ \n  \nAdditional battleships soon appeared, followed by a Revenant-class Sansha
    Supercarrier with Citizen Astur in command. The capsuleer fleet, lead by Grideris
    from Fleet Coordination Command, destroyed the battleships and also dispatched
    the Sansha supercarrier.  \n  \nIce Shard, scoring the most damage on the Revenant,
    seemingly enjoyed the fight; \"It was fun, next time Sansha are welcome to Jita.\"
    \ \n  \nAfter and even during the battle, several people took the opportunity
    to salvage and loot the already destroyed ships, gaining some income without firing
    a single shot.  \n  \nThe purpose behind the attack on New Caldari still remains
    unclear as Sansha incursions continue to sprout along trade routes.\n\n* * *\n\nAre
