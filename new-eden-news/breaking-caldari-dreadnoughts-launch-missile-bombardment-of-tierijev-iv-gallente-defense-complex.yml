- body: 'Tierijev, Verge Vendor - A squadron of Phoenix-class dreadnoughts has reportedly
    begun a bombardment of the fourth planet of the Tierijev system. The apparent
    strike across the Gallente Federation''s Verge Vendor border with the Citadel
    region in the Caldari State comes soon after a report of a major explosion at
    the Caldari CEP''s primary Spire in Landfall City on New Caldari Prime.


    The status of the Tierijev border system was disputed by the Caldari and Gallente
    governments for many decades after the end of the Caldari-Gallente War. Although
    the system was determined to be Gallente territory under the Yulai Accords, it
    remains a sore point of contention for Caldari nationalists. The Gallente Federation
    maintains an extensive defense complex on Tierijev IV, and there are a variety
    of settlements and industrial colonies on the planet.


    Reports from both New Caldari Prime and Tierijev are confused but the Caldari
    Navy has declared the "orbital defenses and security of New Caldari Prime intact".
    The Federation Navy is reported to be scrambling fleet units to support Tierijev
    as the bombardment by Caldari dreadnoughts continues. AEGIS defense units in the
    system are also reported to be responding.'
