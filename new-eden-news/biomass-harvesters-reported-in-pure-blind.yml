    to purchase any available cadavers from local capsule pilots in the area.   \n
    \ \nSighted in the EC-P8R solar system \u2013 the persons, who were identified
    as members of the Adaptive Provisioning Corporation, were apparently working at
    the behest of an unnamed client to procure a quantity of biomass.   \n  \nMarn
    Toril \u2013 CEO of Adaptive Provisioning is said to have led the operation and
    was apparently disinclined to give any details regarding the client. Toril reportedly
    explained to the local capsuleers that he had no knowledge of his client\u2019s
    intentions for the requested biomass, stating simply that his corporation was
    \u2018paid to procure things\u2019.   \n  \nThe Adaptive Provisioning team is
    said to have found several willing corpse vendors and secured a total of ten cadavers
    for their client. Toril and his employees, who were flying covert ops vessels;
    allegedly suffered an unprovoked attack by the final seller as they were leaving,
    but escaped unharmed despite being pursued by a hostile stealth bomber.   \n  \nMarn
    Toril was not available for comment on the night\u2019s events."
