- body: "A scientist researching new cloning techniques was murdered on Saturday evening
    while en route to his Yulai laboratories.   \n  \nThe man, who was identified
    as one Dr Tourny \u2013 an expert in the field of cloning technology; was apparently
    set upon by several individuals in the Du Annes solar system and suffered a fatal
    capsule breach during the altercation.   \n  \nAt this time the motive for the
    killing is unclear, but thought to involve research Dr Tourny had been conducting
    into a new type of clone. Purportedly having a 100% memory retention rate; this
    would theoretically eliminate the risk of any brain damage resulting in skill
    or memory loss after pod death.   \n  \nThough Dr Tourny has written several scientific
    papers on his research, no conclusive evidence has been put forward to support
    his theories.   \n  \nThe attack is believed to have been orchestrated by members
    of rival organisation \u2013 Deko Industries, who were reportedly accompanied
    by a mercenary pilot identified as Xuthas.   \n  \nThough Dr Tourny is not thought
    to have suffered a final death, the current whereabouts and condition of his clone
    is as yet unknown. Sources within the scientific community speculate that Tourny
    may have been using one of his own prototype clones before the attack.   \n  \nNo
    remains were recovered amongst the wreckage of Tourny\u2019s ship, and his assailants
    are thought to have escaped with his cadaver."
