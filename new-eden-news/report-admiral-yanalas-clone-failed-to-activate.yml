- body: '_Perimeter - _The [Caldari Navy](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari
    Navy) has released a report revealing Admiral Visera Yanala''s clone failed to
    activate following her podding during the battle of [Caldari Prime](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari
    Prime). [The State](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari) has reacted in
    shock, as the admiral has widely become viewed as a cultural hero following indications
    she acted to preserve lives on Caldari Prime as her ship was destroyed in orbit.


    State Executor [Tibus Heth](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tibus Heth) subsequently
    gave a statement calling Yanala''s death, "a tragic cloning accident." He went
    on to say, "I can only presume that, as she concentrated to take her final acts,
    she forsook her own safety and hesitated so her capsule was caught. What happened
    next is still uncertain, but it only serves to make her sacrifice even greater."


    Across the State, citizens have expressed their shock at the news. Several businesses
    have closed early, including [CBD Sell Division](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/CBD
    Sell Division). Each of the megacorps has also announced they are permitting non-essential
    personnel to leave early if they wish, in order to attend one of the numerous
    memorial ceremonies.


    The [Chief Executive Panel](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Chief Executive
    Panel) has indicated it will investigate the circumstances surrounding the cloning
    accident. It has announced the traditional opening bell to the State Stock Exchange
    will not be rung tomorrow morning, instead being replaced with an eight-gun salute
    in Admiral Yanala''s honor.'
