- body: "**Kador Region** \\- The Amarr Civic Court today requested that Ni-Kunni
    Goran Mitelek, the UDI operative captured by Gallente police forces in a skirmish
    in Sinq Laison last week, be extradited to the Amarr government.   \n  \nMitelek,
    an electronic warfare specialist and reputed former Angel Cartel member, is reportedly
    wanted for a long list of crimes against the Empire, among them the supplying
    of arms and explosives to \"anti-government revolutionaries\" and participation
    in \"numerous operations detrimental to the Empire's interests.\"   \n  \nMitelek's
    involvement in the Elarel massacre of three weeks ago is at this time unknown,
    but according to inside intelligence sources he is believed to have played a major
    role in orchestrating the attack. His influence within the UDI organization is
    unknown.   \n  \nPresident Foiritan of the Gallente Federation has not been reached
    for comment, but a senior aide in the President's Office, speaking on condition
    of anonymity, believes the chances of the President's acceptance of extradition
    terms are \"less than slim.\"   \n  \nThe matter is expected to be taken up in
    tomorrow's Federal Branch Assembly, where political analysts are already predicting
    fireworks between President Foiritan and his opponents in the Senate."
