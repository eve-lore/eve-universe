- body: "In the past few hours over 70 bodies belonging to Minmatar slaves and gladiators
    have been found lying in a disused hanger in the Amarrian Navy's Assembly Plant
    in the system of Zaimeth. The bodies, heavily decomposed, were only discovered
    after complaints about the smell emanating from the warehouse were made to regional
    authorities by guests at the station.   \n  \nLaid out in a way indicative of
    traditional Amarrian burial rites before a small, makeshift altar, the bodies
    all bore the hallmarks of severe Vitoc withdrawal. Preliminary analysis of the
    corpses conducted by local specialists has identified several of the bodies, both
    gladiators and slaves, as having belonged to the murdered holder Bamadak Pareh.
    When speaking with his widow it was revealed that several of his best gladiators
    did not suffer the same fate, having not been treated with Vitoc as a gift from
    the holder for their exemplary performances in the underground gladiatorial ring.
    A number of the slaves have also been positively identified as belonging to the
    late Rezini Lifu, however none of the dead gladiators have yet been identified
    as belonging to him.   \n  \nA blood stained Matari ceremonial blade was also
    found nearby in a patch of dried blood, which has since been established as what
    appears to be the remnants of a Minmatar retribution ceremony. Quite what all
    this has to do with the recent attacks on Vitoc shipments by gladiatorial raiding
    parties and pod pilots alike has not been revealed, however this has not stopped
    the speculations from all involved."
