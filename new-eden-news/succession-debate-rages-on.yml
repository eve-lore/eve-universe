- body: "At the most recent sitting of the Privy council, Pomikide Haromi, steward
    of House Sarum, voiced his house's express views on the recent succession debate.
    \  \n  \n\u201CHouse Sarum feels that the past open doors policy of ascension
    was patently ridiculous. We cannot and should not allow anyone but true Amarrians
    to decide the future of our glorious empire. It's no wonder that the last two
    chosen Emperors were such weaklings?   \n  \nIt is time for Amarrians to stand
    for Amarr, stop kowtowing to these heathen Empires and reclaim our glorious past.
    It is time to choose a new Emperor!\u201D   \n  \nWhen asked whether House Sarum
    would be naming its successor to Jamyl, the steward reminded all present that
    \u201CHouse Sarum's business is just that, but you can be assured that all will
    happen as it should\u201D   \n  \nUpon hearing the steward's comments, Ariticio
    Kor-Azor, Heir of house Kor-Azor, took the opportunity to present his own views
    upon the subject:   \n  \n\u201COh, please. It is obvious to even the dumbest
    heathen who the next Emperor should be. The blathering of the other houses only
    postpones my own inevitable ascension. As for the Chamberlain, I am amazed he
    has even survived this long.   \n  \nConcerning the Championships, I move that
    we abolish representation and have individual combat. Who would dare stand against
    me?!\u201C   \n  \nAcross the Empire, the debate continues."
