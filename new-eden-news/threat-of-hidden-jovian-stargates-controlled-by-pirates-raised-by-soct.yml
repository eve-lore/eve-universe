    Threat of Hidden Jovian Stargates Controlled by Pirates Raised by SoCT Address
    to CONCORD Assembly\n\nYulai, Genesis \u2013 In a dramatic public address to the
    CONCORD Assembly, Elder Mentor Matshi Raish of the Society of Conscious Thought
    revealed the probable existence of one or more hidden Jovian stargates across
    New Eden. Elder Mentor Raish also raised the alarming prospect that any such gates
    may be under the control of major pirate organizations such as the Angel Cartel
    and Guristas Pirates.\n\nThe Elder Mentor of the SoCT focused his presentation
    on an analysis of data fragments recovered principally by capsuleer pilots together
    with a report on intelligence gathered by \"Society operatives\" within the network
    of criminals and mercenaries run by the mysterious underworld figure known only
    as \"The Deathless\". Based on the Society's preliminary analysis, stated Raish,
    the most recently recovered data appears with \"high probability\" to show an
    intact and possibly active stargate of Jovian design. This shocking revelation
    was accompanied by an overview of new intelligence gathered on the \"Deathless
    Circle\" organization, including surveillance of a high-level meeting of notorious
    Angel Cartel and Guristas Pirates commanders with a representative of the Deathless.\n\n![partially

    recent months, CONCORD and empire intelligence and security agencies have been
    tracking increasing levels of pirate activity, particularly involving the Angel
    Cartel, Guristas, and criminal organizations associated with the Deathless Circle.
    Capsuleers fighting Angel and Guristas pirates have also been able to recover
    a number of data fragments from the wrecks of command vessels, many of which show
    disturbing signs of increasing technical capability among the ranks of two of
    the largest crime and piracy groups in New Eden. Data recovered over a period
    of several weeks has indicated the development of two advanced pirate destroyer
    designs, one codenamed \"Mamba\" by the Guristas and another designated \"Mekubal\"
    by the Cartel.\n\nDisturbing signs of increased co-operation between the Angel
    Cartel and Guristas Pirates, apparently brokered by the Deathless Circle, have
    been monitored by CONCORD for some time. [The raids on SoCT research facilities
    and plundering of Jove Observatories by the \"Guri Malakim\" alliance](https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/soct-sounds-warning-over-uncontrolled-spread-of-advanced-technology)
    organized by Rafik Zohar and Esri Hakuzosu appear to have heralded a confluence
    of interests between the Guristas and Cartel, with the Deathless orchestrating
    a widespread campaign of pirate activity across New Eden.\n\n![zohar hakuzosu

    with Deathless Circle*\n\n### Intelligence Gathered on the Deathless Circle\n\nElder
    Mentor Matshi Raish believes the latest intelligence demonstrates that, \"The
    Deathless is enabling these major pirate groups to accelerate their technical
    development and the network operated by the Deathless Circle has stolen vast quantities
    of data and resources to these ends.\" The threat posed by the potential control
    of Jovian stargates by a coalition of the Deathless, Angels, and Guristas is \"too
    great to be ignored\" according to the SoCT.\n\n\"It is due to the dire nature
    of this threat that I have chosen to address the full CONCORD Assembly in open
    session. The reality is that the focus of the empires on their own internecine
    conflicts and wars with one another have degraded the security situation in New
    Eden. The gangsters, smugglers, and renegade mercenaries of the Deathless Circle
    and their pirate allies have taken advantage of the open wounds caused by war
    and terror to multiply like a poisonous infection,\" said Matshi Raish.\n\nThe
    Elder Mentor then elaborated on his hope that independent pilots could assist
    the SoCT: \"I therefore look to the capsuleers of New Eden, those of good will
    and who have served the Society so well before. Any data or intelligence that
    independent capsuleers can provide to use may be forwarded directly to me via
    fluid router mail messaging. I am authorizing a 50 billion ISK reward for information
    that precisely locates any single site of what we strongly believe to be ancient
    Jovian stargates. Further details will be provided as our analysis efforts continue.\"\n\n---\n\n*Ref
