- body: 'YULAI  - CONCORD''s Directive Enforcement Department has confirmed the loss
    of a specialist taskforce deployed to investigate rogue drone activity across
    the Oasa, Malpais and Etherium Reach regions. The DED''s Special Projects Office
    has offically listed Taskforce Pegasus as lost following cessation of all communications
    three days ago.


    "Regrettably Taskforce Pegasus is now overdue on its third daily communication
    checkpoint and we must therefore declare the fleet led by the flagship Pegasus
    as lost with all hands missing in action," announced Chief of Operations Sato
    Kyrin of the Special Projects Office.


    Pressed for details of the purpose of the Taskforce Pegasus mission, Chief Ops.
    Kyrin would only state that, "the taskforce was assigned to investigate signs
    of increased and changing rogue drone activity in that theater of operations."


    The Scope understands that the Pegasus and its fleet had been tasked to investigate
    The Spire region in addition to Etherium Reach, Oasa and Malpais but communications
    were lost before the exploration tour could be completed. Chief Ops. Kyrin declined
    to comment further on the nature of the change in rogue drone activity detected
    by DED monitoring stations.


    Despite their presence throughout New Eden, and the severe infestations in the
    "Drone Regions", the levels of rogue drone activity have been relatively contained
    since the major outbreaks that led to the Code Aria Inquiry of YC109. The Code
    Aria Inquiry report was subsequently leaked in early YC110 and is [available through
    the Scope''s GalNet archive](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/reports/CodeAria.pdf).'
