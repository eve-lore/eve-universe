    since the outcome of the Succession Trials which ultimately decided her fate,
    Jamyl Sarum shocked the galaxy by committing ritual suicide (\u201CShathol\u2019Syn\u201D)
    without naming an heir to her own family during the Amarr Inaugural Ceremony,
    thus leaving her colossal military power and territories unclaimed. The consensus
    among political analysts is that the transition from Heideran VII to the rule
    of Emperor Doriam Kor-Azor is having a significant destabilizing effect on the
    Amarr Empire. Sarum\u2019s popularity and influence with Amarrians in military
    service is enormous, as evident by the assassination attempt on Kor-Azor\u2019s
    life by Sarum loyalists during the Inauguration Ceremony.  \n\n\nOne by one, Emperor
    Doriam Kor-Azor asked each of the candidate heirs\u2014Temal Kador, Davit Tash-Murkon,
    and Idonis Ardishapur\u2014if they accepted him as their emperor. Each did so
    in turn, first acknowledging their place in this gruesome affair as the \u201Cdesign
    of God\u201D, and then naming an heir within each of their respective families
    to be their own successor. Only then did they self-destruct their ships and ultimately
    their own pods. Their lifeless corpses hung suspended in space for all 50-plus
    Amarr citizens in attendance to witness firsthand before being collected by Imperial
    Overseers for return to their families for burial.  \n\n\nAnd then all eyes focused
    on Jamyl Sarum\u2019s Apocalypse, floating alongside the great Amarr Cathedral,
    the site of an epic battle that took place there between Amarr and Jovian forces
    decades before.  \n\n\n\u201CMy fourth decree is to call on Jamyl Sarum. Are you
    here, Jamyl Sarum?\u201D asked Kor-Azor. There was no response. Her ship remained
    motionless. After a minute or two, the Emperor broke the ominous silence:  \n\n\n\u201CYour
    answer, Lady Sarum.\u201D  \n\n\nNo sooner had he said those words, warnings were
    shouted on the local channel that at least one Imperial-class battleship with
    escort ships had breached the perimeter defenses in place for the ceremony. Seconds
    later they appeared, coming out of warp right in the middle of the ceremony grounds
    and launching a savage attack on Kor-Azor\u2019s ship.  \n\n\nSarum\u2019s voice
    broke through the radio chatter: \u201CMy Loyal Followers, cease your fire.\u201D
    But it was too late, as the exhaust plumes from a dozen heavy missiles began converging
    on the Emperor's ship. \u201CTrue Empress, we salute thee! Let the infidels burn!\u201D
    cried Amarr Fleet Admiral Sulei Manatir, the lead warship in the attack, as missile
    after missile detonated against Kor-Azor\u2019s shields and hull. Several other
    ships in attendance also opened fire, some in defense of Kor-Azor, others in defense
    of Sarum\u2019s loyalists.  \n\n\nSarum spoke again: \u201CCease fire.\u201D The
    explosions of several vessels lit up the ceremony grounds as Manatir, relentless
    in his attack, cried out \u201CNow behold the sinners engulfed in the vengeful
    flames of justice!\u201D  \n\n\nBut Kor-Azor\u2019s ship was somehow able to withstand
    the wicked barrage of missiles, multispectral tachyon fire, and potent weaponry
    never before witnessed by the citizens in attendance, and managed to escape into
    warp during the frenzy. Sarum spoke again, this time in a very stern, authoritative
    tone: \u201CMove away from this area, Sulei.\u201D But Sulei was adamant in his
    attack, clearly unwilling or unable to accept Sarum\u2019s fate. \u201CLet the
    glory of the Lady shine from its rightful place!\u201D  \n\n\nSarum\u2019s voice
    now sounded angry. \u201CI demand that you leave this area at once. Commander,
    who has ordered you to do this?\u201D There was no answer from Sulei, but his
    attack force ceased fire and warped out of the ceremonial grounds.  \n\n\nAnd
    then suddenly, inexplicably, without any warning or indication, Sarum\u2019s ship
    exploded. When the shockwave dissipated, the lone, shining beacon lights of her
    pod blinked a few times\u2014the final moments of her life. A second explosion
    followed as the pod self-destructed, and there floated the corpse of one of the
    most powerful figures in Amarr history. She did not leave an heir to her fortune,
    she did not mention who would take command of the thousands of warships under
    her direct command, and she did not have any last words for Amarr or to those
    most loyal to her.  \n\n\nSarum\u2019s abrupt departure leaves a power vacuum
    within the Amarr Empire that has serious implications on the internal stability
    of Amarr. Political analyst Kedrick Liamsen explains. \u201CNo one saw this coming.
    The other states\u2014except the Minmatar Republic, who certainly see all this
    in a much different light\u2014are undoubtedly thinking to themselves that this
    was the worst thing that could have possibly happened. Everyone's worst-case scenario
    envisioned a struggle between two or more distinct forces within Amarr vying for
    power and challenging Kor-Azor's right to the throne. What\u2019s happened in
    reality is, in fact, much worse. Now the most popular and influential of the Amarr
    royal families is beginning to unravel. Who can bring Sarum\u2019s House to order
    before the other Houses see opportunity in this situation?\u201D  \n\n\nFleet
    Admiral Sulei Manatir had presided over the Amarr Championship Award Ceremony
    last week, and there was no indication then that he would try to intervene on
    behalf of Sarum\u2019s life during the Inauguration. \u201CManatir was Sarum\u2019s
    highest-ranking fleet commander, not to mention one of her most trusted advisors.
    Her faith in him was well placed, as he is a brilliant commander and an extremely
    lethal adversary when it comes to naval warfare. And there are none more loyal
    to Jamyl Sarum than he is. It\u2019s possible that he may try to pick up the pieces
    and establish control over the military elements of Sarum\u2019s family, but I
    can\u2019t imagine that will be easy for him. Where will the loyalties be directed
    towards now that Jamyl is gone? Will the Majors and Commanders follow military
    ranks or the orders coming from Jamyl Sarum\u2019s kin? Will Kor-Azor intervene,
    and if so, through whom does he delegate with in the Sarum family? It\u2019s a
    completely unpredictable situation.\u201D"
