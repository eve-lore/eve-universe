    >*An Amarr Holder, part of the Amarrian elite*


    Always a deeply religious people, religion remains of great importance to every
    Amarr, a fervor which at various times has been responsible both for great good
    and great evil. Shortly after recovering from the closure of the [EVE Gate](2z1KQXUVtPP1WmlwcJaX4o),
    they began to expand their realm at the expense of neighboring states. The nations
    they conquered were enslaved, a practice justified by their religion.


    In the thousands of years since, the Amarr have enslaved every nation and race
    they have encountered, so that today slavery is an essential part of Amarr society.
    This has, of course, tainted their relations with other empires, especially the
    individualistic [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK).


    ### Interstellar Empire


    The Amarr were the first of the races in New Eden to re-discover [interstellar
    travel](1u0PE6hhhvdHlflIDkfHYz) technology, including [jump gate tech](416pCzXGIwn2Tt7feZYSpk).
    After accomplishing this, more than 2,000 years ago, they immediately began expanding
    to nearby solar systems, slowly building up their empire in the process. On the
    way, they encountered two human races, both of whom suffered the fate of being
    enslaved by the far more powerful Amarr.


    In recent years, however, the Amarr have begun to run into serious opposition.
    First, they met the [Gallente Federation](1pYWp5pmyyMhbmD2awB3MF), and found that
    while it was much smaller than the Amarr Empire, its economic and military might
    was a match for their own. Soon after, the [Jove](5G7lpKcSSCEsTz7faQuIxt) arrived
    on the scene and the Amarr made a futile attempt to subjugate them, resulting
    in a humiliating defeat for the Empire. To make matters worse, the [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp),
    enslaved for centuries by the Amarr, used the opportunity to [rebel](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N)
    against their slave-masters.


    Since these fateful events almost two centuries ago, the Amarr have learned restraint.
    They have slowed down their expansion and are less forceful in their dealings
    with other races, but still view themselves as the most powerful race in New Eden,
    if only because of their sheer numbers and, of course, the support of their Holy
    God.'

- body: '## Amarr Heirs


    The Amarr Heirs are the heads of the five royal families, the highest caste of
    the Holders apart from the Emperor family itself. Even if the emperor is the head
    of state his power outside his immediate vicinity is limited. The entrenched bureaucracy
    and the semi-feudal governing system means that all over the empire there are
    local lords that enjoy almost complete autonomy most of time. The Heirs are the
    most powerful of these lords. Each heir family has vast domains spanning dozens
    of solar systems. The power of the heirs can best be seen in the way each of them
    shapes their domain to fit his own wishes. The result is that the Amarr Empire
    is a patchwork of rules and regulations, customs and traditions.


    The power of the heir families originates in the changes made during the Moral
    Reform some 1500 years ago, when the influence of the Apostles was curbed. The
    Privy Council, the unofficial government of the empire, also dates from this time
    and all the heirs sit on it. Four of the current heir families are the original
    families given royal status during the Moral Reform. The fifth is a recent addition
    after the Khanid family was exiled. The five families are: the Ardishapur family,
    the Kador family, the Sarum family, the Kor-Azor family and the Tash-Murkon family
    (the new one). The heads for three of these families are introduced below. The
    Heir of the Ardishapur family is Yonis Ardishapur, a champion of the faith and
    avid collector of religious artifacts, some thought to date since before the closure
    of the EVE gate. The Sarum family has yet to name an Heir to replace Jamyl Sarum;
    its domains are currently run by its House Chamberlain.'
