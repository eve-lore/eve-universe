    independent people. Their home planet of Matar is a natural paradise, although
    centuries of abuse have taken much from its beauty.\n\nOf the four major races
    of New Eden, none has endured more tragedy and suffering than the Minmatar. Once
    part of a thriving and technologically capable tribal civilization, billions of
    Matari were enslaved by the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) for more than
    seven hundred years, until a mass rebellion freed most, but not all, of those
    held in servitude. Initially modeling its\nrecovery after [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK)
    notions of democracy, the Minmatar Republic was born through the cooperation of
    four major tribes.\n\nFor the Minmatar, the most important thing in life is to
    be able to take care of yourself on your own, and although kin and family play
    an important role in their society, they prefer identifying themselves by the
    clan or tribe to which they belong. A clan can have any number of people in it,
    and its size is largely dictated by the main activity of its members. Most specialize
    in one area of activity. While those who live on a planet can focus on agricultural
    or industrial activity, others who travel around the world of EVE concentrate
    on trading, pirating, and suchlike.\n\n>![Minmatar Soldier](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/communityassets/img/backstory/minmatar_soldier.jpg#right)\n>
    \n> *A Minmatar soldier during the Minmatar Rebellion*\n\nIn the distant past
    the clans constantly warred against each other. Since then, however, Minmatar
    have learned that cooperation is more important, and although the clans still
    try to maintain their regional and ideological identities, they act as a single
    unit towards other races.\n\nThe fortunes of the Minmatar have ebbed and flowed
    continuously. At one time they had a flourishing empire with a level of mechanical
    excellence never before or since seen anywhere. Later, however, they had to endure
    centuries of enslavement, toiling and dying for the benefit of foreign masters.
    Today most of them have regained their freedom, but the legacy of their enslavement
    has been the diaspora of the race.\n\nThe Minmatar are the most numerous of all
    the races in [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk), but their vast numbers are dispersed
    widely and\ndivided into many factions. While the Minmatar Republic is the official
    state, only a quarter of all Minmatar currently alive are part of it. A very large
    proportion, almost a third, remains enslaved within the huge Amarr Empire, while
    a fifth resides within the Gallente Federation, creating a powerful political
    bloc that contributes in no small part to the constant state of tension between
    Gallente and Amarr.\n\n>![Mind-control cyber-implants](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/communityassets/img/backstory/minmatar_mind_control_implants.jpg#left)\n>
    \n> *The Amarrians are fond of using mind-controlling cyber-implants on their
    Minmatar slaves*\n\nThe remainder, who are not part of any formal organization,
    live as freemen throughout the world. Many are itinerant laborers, roaming from
    one system to another in search of work. A fair number make their living on the
    darker side of\nthe law, acting as pirates, smugglers, and peddlers in all kinds
    of illegal goods. It is worth noting that many of the larger criminal groups in
    New Eden, such as the [Angel Cartel](3p6aB4GMbVdMUEVYOb3kF0) include many people
    of Minmatar heritage among their leadership.\n\nThe free Minmatar peoples are
    resilient, ingenious, and hard working. Perhaps most of all they are proud, and
    many of them believe that democracy, though it served them well at first, will
    never restore what was taken from them by the Amarr Empire. As all seven tribes
    of Matar have united again and found a new sense of their identity in the Empyrean
    Age, the development of the Minmatar Republic has swung\naway from Gallente ideas
    of unadulterated democracy. The Minmatar have created a form of government truly
    reflective of their historical tribal culture. Almost invariably they remain deeply
    attached to their enslaved kindred and will go to\nextraordinary lengths to recover
    them. The Minmatar will forever resent the Amarr and yearn for the days before
    the empire\u2019s accursed ships ever reached their home world.\n"

- body: "## Minmatar Tribes\n\nThe Minmatar Republic is very much based on tribal
    society. The Republic's justice system is handled on a tribal level. Tribes have
    their own courts and judgment halls.\n\nThere are seven major tribes, [Sebiestor](1fNour0sFTIcCFRVQM2pro),
    [Krusual](7KI9OEieV9sdjksayCyoGk), [Brutor](5xBrtZyeYfTxWkZTO1o5zg), [Vherokior](6VDPzsKX9TVbVtXEwjj0RB),
    [Nefantar](1lfEcB4SdrV3EJIrmYWOK2), [Thukker](3uoxvtJY1Z30BoVwuJLj2z) and [Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw).
    Of these seven tribes, four founded and made up the Minmatar Republic for a time:
    the Sebiestor, Krusual, Brutor and Vherokior. The other three suffered various
    fates of dispersal or absence over the centuries. \n\nThe Starkmanir tribe was
    almost totally destroyed by the Amarrians after a crushed rebellion four centuries
    ago. Until recently, it was believed only a handful remained as slaves within
    the Amarr Empire. The Nefantars collaborated with the Amarrians during the occupation
    of Minmatar territory. They were driven out alongside the Amarrians during the
    Minmatar Rebellion and became known as the Ammatars. Lastly, the Thukkers were
    widely scattered throughout New Eden in the course of the Amarr occupation, their
    tribal bindings are loose and many of them don't even consider themselves to be
    a part of a tribe any longer. A great number of Thukker have rejected many of
    the strongest traditions of the Minmatars, such as tattooing.\n\nHowever, much
    has changed in the last decade or so, and many Nefantar, the Starkmanir and even
    the Thukker are now turning back to their homeland in great droves. A remnant
    of the Starkmanir survived hidden within the Ammatar Mandate and returned to the
    Republic alongside a great number of Nefantar defectors. The nomadic Thukker Tribe,
    which had coalesced in the Great Wildlands since the Great Rebellion and foundation
    of the Republic, chose to formally rejoin the Republic on terms that maintained
    their autonomy in their home region. As a result, today a great many free Minmatar
    live in a Tribal Republic made up of all seven of the great tribes of Matar.\n\n###
    Tribal Life\n\nThe large, fertile plains of Matar, home planet of the Minmatars,
    with endless herds of hoofed animals, proved ideal for a nomadic lifestyle. The
    fabulous conditions on Matar coupled with more than enough space meant there was
    less incentive to struggle to keep up the technology level after the closure of
    the EVE gate. For ages the Minmatars roamed this paradise, slowly divided by time
    and distance into numerous tribes.\n\nThe tribal community was ideally suited
    for nomads, but remarkably the Minmatars kept their strong tribal ties after urbanization
    began, even if some of its more strict aspects have declined in recent times,
    such as the stringent caste system and (for some of the tribes) acreage serfdom
    for farmers and workers. To this day, Minmatars identify themselves first and
    foremost through their clan.\n\nThe Minmatar tribes evolved their own traditions
    over time, but limited communications between them ensured a few basic similarities
    in their social structure. One of these is the pyramid structure of the tribe:
    each tribe has a number of family clans, which are then further divided into sub-clans
    based on occupation, geographical location and other traits (this is different
    between the tribes even if the overall structure is the same). \n\nEach of the
    seven major tribes has a tribal leader; this person serves much the same role
    as a president or a head of state for each tribes. The authority of the tribe
    leader is unquestioned within the tribe, but he has little or no power outside
    his tribe. The clan structure is both one of the main strengths and main weaknesses
    of the Minmatars. On the one hand the strong tribal bonds have kept the Minmatars
    pure in their cultural heritage, but on the other hand it makes them politically
    weak and vulnerable versus the other empires."
