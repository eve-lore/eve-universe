    run by a few megacorporations which divide the state between them, controlling
    and ruling every aspect of society. Each corporation is made up of thousands of
    smaller companies, ranging from industrial companies to law firms. All land and
    real estate is owned by a company which leases it to the citizens, and government
    and policing are also handled by independent companies.\n\n>![Kaalakiota corporation

    \n> *A ship of the Kaalakiota corporation enroute to New Caldari*\n\nAlthough
    this gives the corporations dictatorial powers, they are just as bound by Caldari
    customs and laws as the individual, and the fierce, continual competition between
    the corporations ensures a healthy, consumer-based social environment, which benefits
    everyone.\n\nWhile the Caldari State may not be nearly as big as that of the Gallenteans,
    let alone the Amarrians, they are still universally feared and admired. Their
    economy is strong, and their military might parallel to that of the larger empires.
    Coupled to the fact that they are more unscrupulous than the Gallenteans and more
    combative than the Amarrians, this makes them in many ways the most meddlesome
    of all the empires. As most Caldari trade is conducted by individual companies
    rather than the State itself, this makes it difficult for the other empires to
    deal with them at a political level. If a company is found guilty of unethical
    business dealings, it simply disappears into its parent corporation, and before
    long another one appears to take its place. But if a Caldari company is threatened,
    the whole corporation and often the whole State backs it up with full force.\n\n##
    Caldari Society\n\n>![Splinterz](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/communityassets/img/backstory/caldari_splinterz.jpg#right)\n>
    \n> *Scene from Splinterz, robotic duels that the Caldari love betting on*\n\nCaldari
    society is steeped in military tradition. As a people, its members had to fight
    a long and bloody war to gain their independence, and even had to surrender their
    home planet to their hated enemies, the Gallenteans.\n\nIt was at this time that
    the corporations established themselves as the driving force behind creating and
    maintaining the new Caldari State. Even if the Caldari have not engaged in war
    for many decades, they still strive to be at the cutting edge of military technology
    and their vessels, weapons and fighting methods are inferior to none but the enigmatic
    Jovians.\n\nTo curb their aggressive tendencies, the Caldari actively pursue and
    sponsor a range of sporting activities. Many of these are bloody, gladiatorial-like
    competitions, while others are more like races. But whatever the sport, the Caldari
    love betting on the outcome, making gambling a massive industry in the State.\n\nThe
    Caldari State offers its citizens the best and the worst in living conditions.
    As long as you keep in line, do your job, uphold the laws and so forth, life can
    be fairly pleasant and productive. But for those who are not cut out for this
    strict, disciplined regime life quickly becomes intolerable. They lose their respect,
    family, status, everything, and the only options left to them are suicide or exile.
    Although not xenophobic as such, the Caldari are very protective of their way
    of life and tolerate only those foreigners that stick to the rules.\n"

- body: "## Caldari Corporations\n\nThe Caldari State stands for corporate capitalism
    in its purest form. There are eight great corporations that together own more
    than 90% of all property within the State. Each of the corporation is made up
    of thousands of companies of various sizes and various sorts, ranging from simple
    mining companies to powerful police companies. \n\nThere is no single, unified
    government as such, each corporation rules its territories like their own kingdom
    with little or nor interference from the other corporations. In higher matters,
    such as in foreign policy towards the other empires, the Chief Executive Panel,
    which consists of the CEOs of the eight major corporations, has the highest authority.
    The Chief Executive Panel also makes sure that the social infrastructure of the
    State remains intact and settles all major quarrels between the corporations.\n\n###
