    The Gallenteans. Self-righteous, meddling, pompous and tiresome, or virile liberalists
    and defenders of the free world. Love them or hate them, you simply can''t ignore
    them. Everybody has an opinion on the Gallente Federation, it all depends from
    which side of the table you view them. For many, it is the Promised Land, where
    any dream can become a reality. Descendants of ancient Tau Ceti colonists, the
    Gallenteans remain strong believers in free will and human rights, despite numerous
    setbacks in their long history.


    It has been said that, once you have seen the [Crystal Boulevard](45ZcfxzqF7v2mqmLksGxYU)
    in Caille you''ve seen it all.

    True, the view is spectacular, but if there''s one thing you can never

    see in its entirety, that is the Gallente Federation. You may travel its

    length and breadth, marvel at the Sunspiral on Troux, climb the Akat

    Mountains on tropical Intaki or thrill to the Mendre dancers on

    [Sovicou](3bFH4a0UeEG2PRs7vkKcBu). Wherever you go, you will always see

    something new and exciting, even when you visit the same place again.

    Gallente society is in a constant state of flux, vigorous, vibrant and

    progressive.

    Few societies display such stark contrasts. Many of the wealthiest people in the
    world are Gallenteans, creating a constant demand for luxury goods. At the same
    time, the ranks of the poor number millions, because while the liberal market-driven
    economy and individual freedom may allow everybody the chance to advance to the
    top, they make it just as easy to plummet to the very bottom of the social ladder.


    In the world of EVE, the Gallentean are the kings of entertainment, mass-producing
    everything from cheap porn-flicks to elaborate stage-shows for an ever-hungry
    public. They boast the most elaborate luxury space yachts, and the most glittering
    hotel reservoirs. Anything your mind or body could ever crave, the Gallenteans
    have plenty of it.

- body: "## Gallente Federation\n\nThe Gallente Federation was founded a little over
    300 years ago. At that time the Federation consisted of 17 sectors or districts
    and four races. A district is a group of solar systems (of various sizes). The
    number of [districts](16zHmICudQrpRwoTAetCoN) has steadily increased through the
    ages and now stands at 62. The four races at the Federation's creation were the
    Gallenteans (by far the largest of the four), the Caldari, the Intakis and the
    Mannars. \n\nThe Gallente are not alone in their Federation, whose boundaries
    are home to pockets of residents, varying in size and representing all the other
    races of New Eden , most of whom left their own empires due to political or ideological
    differences, or simply in search of peace and prosperity.\n\nThe Caldari were
    initially part of the Federation but deep-seated differences and mutual animosity
    between them and the Gallente drove them out to found their own empire. For a
    time, the two empires warred against each other, but as neither could gain sufficient
    advantage to claim victory, peace was settled in the end.\n\nIn addition to the
    Caldari there are two other founding peoples, the Intakis and the Mannars, both
    found by the Gallenteans while exploring and expanding their empire. Both were
    at a very primitive level when the Gallenteans found them, but since coming under
    the protection and guidance of the Gallenteans, both races have flourished and
    today are fully-fledged members of the Federation.\n\nThe Gallente, Intaki, and
    Mannar remain, and have since been bolstered by immigrants from all the races,
    most notably Minmatars. People of Minmatar ancestry number almost a third of the
    total population of the Federation. \n\n## Political Culture\n\nThe core belief
    of the Federation is that of individuality and individual freedom. But in practice
    this has created a paradox as the individual freedom to do what you want constantly
    clashes with the individual freedom from being oppressed by other individuals.
    Any governmental interference to keep things in check through legislation and
    policing is naturally perceived as oppression of the rights and freedom of individuals,
    constantly creating tension. But the Federation and its populace have learned
    to direct and control this tension, making it in many ways a positive thing. The
    result is an exceedingly vibrant society, constantly scrutinizing itself and its
    principles, spurring creativity and ethical notions.\n\n### The Executive\n\nA
    president heads the executive arm of the Gallente Federation. The president is
    elected every 5 years and the same man cannot be re-elected. The intent of this
    rule is to make the president and his administration focus on running the Federation
    rather than focus on their own popularity. Nevertheless, because the presidency
    is so closely linked to the lobbyism factions and thus to the Senate, the Gallente
    Federation is often a huge spectacle where appearance matters more than efficiency.\n\nThe
    Gallente president is nominally the head of state and the most powerful man in
    the Federation, but this is not always the case. Some presidents were puppets
    of political factions acting behind the scenes, but most of them have acted independently,
    although always within the strict framework set by the lobbyist factions.\n\nFor
    many the president is nothing more than the smiling face of the government; an
    actor playing the role of the kind, considerate and generous father of the people.
    This notion is supported by the trappings of the presidency, its fabulous palaces
    and space shuttles, purposefully aiming to awe and amaze foreign visitors and
    Gallenteans alike.\n\n### The Legislature\n\nThe Federal Senate holds 881 members,
    with elections held every 5 years. The Senate is responsible for passing new laws
    and in supervising that the administration and the courts are behaving properly.
    The most important function of the Senate is in overseeing the taxation and fiscal
    spending by the government. In addition to the Federal Senate, each district has
    its own parliament (simply called district parliaments), whose official function
    is to advise and support the Senate on local issues, but in reality the parliaments
    wield a great deal of authority over the affairs of their district.\n\nLobbying
    plays a big part Gallentean politics. The lobbying factions have become an integral
    part of the system, affecting and even regulating everything from the elections
    to what bills are presented before the Senate. The other races point to the entrenched
    lobbyists as a clear sign of corruption and in the supposed Gallentean democracy,
    but the Gallenteans themselves regard the lobbyists as a robust system for keeping
    the Senate in touch with society, comparing their role to that of stock brokers
    in the trade hall.\n\n### The Judiciary\n\nThe judicial system in the Gallente
    Federation is ever vigilant in keeping the Federation as wholesome as possible.
    The system is not known for being fair in their dealings with the Federation's
    citizens, as it almost seems like there are two different penal systems in use
    depending on the wealth of the accused. But even if the rich can expect some leniency
    in sentences imposed by the courts they don't get preferential treatment in the
    investigation of the crime, meaning that you are just as likely to be caught for
    a crime whether you're at the top or the bottom of the social ladder. And history
    shows that the social rejection by their peers is even more efficient in punishing
    the rich than a few years more or less in prison.\n\nThe highest judicial power
    is the Supreme Court, which consists of 13 judges, appointed for life by the president
    and approved by the Senate. Beneath the Supreme Court are the District Courts,
    one for each of the 62 districts."
