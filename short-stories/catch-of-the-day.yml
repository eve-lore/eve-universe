    \u201CGallente frigate Notrimus, you\u2019ve been cleared for docking. Prepare
    for initiation of docking sequence. Enjoy your stay in Korridi station.\u201D
    The monotonous voice of the command tower\u2019s personnel sounded even more bored
    than Gaspar Anoun was feeling. Although the journey had been short and relatively
    uneventful it was always tiresome to deal with Amarr custom officials, and Gaspar
    had met a lot of them in the last few hours since his arrival into Amarr space.\n\nThe
    Amarr station loomed large above him, majestic in its monstrosity. Gaspar swiveled
    his camera drone around, behind him he saw a line of ships waiting to dock while
    a handful of police vessels shuffled along the lines keeping an eye on the foreign
    merchant ships. Looking forward again he noticed that from his angle the sun was
    already partly obscured by the planet - it was late afternoon at the station.\n\nGaspar
    felt his ship respond to the commands of the docking sequence sent by the command
    tower. The ship sailed in a gentle curve towards a docking bay close to the lower
    end of the station. Gaspar noticed that the docking bay was only half full. This
    years Trade Fair wasn\u2019t particularly well attended, it seemed. The auto-control
    eased the ship into a berth, fastening it with a loud clank and a low hiss.\n\nThe
    camera drone had entered the ship when it docked and only the infrared sensors
    were available to Gaspar to get a picture of his surroundings in the few moments
    it took the berth crane to lift the capsule from the ship. Gaspar always hated
    these moments, he relied heavily on his camera drone to get a sense of his whereabouts
    and with it gone he always became uncomfortably aware of the sticky goo and the
    blackness enveloping him in the capsule. But this discomfort was offset by the
    anticipation that in a few minutes he\u2019d be free of the confines of the capsule
    and his senses would again be allowed to feel and function normally.\n\n Gaspar
    washed himself clean in the neat little shower box adjacent to the disembarkation
    room. Then he dressed himself, putting on clothes he kept in the small storage
    box in his capsule. He chose a smart looking suit with a long-sleeved jacket,
    nothing too fancy - he didn\u2019t want to irritate the Amarrians too much by
    his appearance. Gaspar left the room and commissioned a cart robot to follow him
    with his luggage taken from the ship\u2019s cargo hold.\n\nOn the corridor connecting
    the docking area with the main body of the station Gaspar was greeted by a short
    Gallentean in a ruffled suit. The man introduced himself, matching his stride
    with that of Gaspar\u2019s.\n\n\u201CMy name is Naine, Niedanai Naine. I have
    been appointed as your diplomatic attach\xE9 during your stay here.\u201D He wheezed,
    smoothing his greasy hair.\n\n\u201CA diplomatic attach\xE9 you say.\u201D Gaspar
    said, hiding his surprise. \u201CI don\u2019t recall having requested one.\u201D\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s
    the policy now, sir.\u201D Naine said with a tiny smile. \u201CThe Federation
    demands that all Gallenteans wishing to enter into a formal trade agreement with
    the Amarrians must be accompanied by a diplomatic attach\xE9 from the Foreign
    Ministry.\u201D\n\n\u201CHow very thoughtful of them. So, your role is what? Fetch
    my slippers, make me coffee, that sort of thing?\u201D Gaspar answered sarcastically.\n\n\u201CNo,
    sir.\u201D Naine said, visibly hurt. \u201CNo. I\u2019m to ensure that your dealings
    with the Amarrians remain civilized and go through smoothly. In the last few months
    there have been numerous incidents where the negotiating parties parted on bad
    terms because of some real or imaginary slights. It is my job to make sure that
    any misunderstandings don\u2019t escalate into a serious breach.\u201D\n\n\u201CI
    see. Tell me Naine, you must have extensive experience in dealing with the Amarrians,
    right?\u201D Gaspar asked.\n\n\u201CI have worked for the ministry for 14 years.
    During that time I have analyzed and filed thousands of field reports on every
    race there is.\u201D\n\n\u201CSo you have no direct experience of a face to face
    contact with the Amarrians?\u201D Gaspar probed.\n\n\u201CWell\u2026 I, uh\u2026\u201D
    Naine\u2019s face suddenly seemed flushed. \u201CNot as such, sir.\u201D\n\n\u201CSo,
    correct me if I\u2019m wrong.\u201D Gaspar said in an amused tone. \u201CYou,
    a man with absolutely no experience in dealing with the Amarrians or anybody else
    for that matter, are going to supervise me - a 20 year veteran of inter-stellar
    trading - in how to conduct my business. Is that right?\u201D\n\n\u201CWell, I
    won\u2019t supervise as such. I\u2019m more of an advisor, you see.\u201D Naine
    said hesitantly.\n\n\u201COk then, Mr. Advisor. Why don\u2019t you give yourself
    the advice to stay out of my face and we\u2019ll have peace and harmony all around.
    I\u2019ll quietly make my deal and for you it\u2019s mission accomplished.\u201D
    Gaspar said convincingly. Naine mulled things over for a minute before answering:\n\n\u201CI
    guess that could work, as long as I\u2019m present when you\u2019re conducting
    your negotiations, sir.\u201D\n\n\u201CSplendid. Stick to me my dear Niedanai,
    and not only will we swing a hefty profit back home sweet home, but along the
    way I\u2019ll teach you a trick or two about being a Gallentean super-trader.\u201D
    Gaspar said raucously and put his hand over Naine\u2019s shoulders.\n\n\u201CSo
    Naine, where are you from?\u201D Gaspar asked in a friendly tone.\n\n\u201CMe,
    sir? I\u2019m from Sacreaux.\u201D Naine replied perplexed. \u201CIn the Neronne
    district.\u201D He added when he saw the lack of recognition on Gaspar\u2019s
    face.\n\nThe two men navigated the narrow corridors of Korridi station en route
    to Gaspar\u2019s suite, the cart robot trudging behind them carrying Gaspar\u2019s
    emerald-green travel trunks. Gaspar knew his way well around the station as he\u2019d
    been here many times before. He stayed clear of the busy thoroughfares, preferring
    the side corridors as they allowed for a more relaxed stroll. He used the time
    to explain to the woefully ignorant attach\xE9 the purpose if his trip here.\n\n\u201CYou
    know, Naine, the Amarrians can be a real pain in the ass to deal with. But the
    Amarr Empire is a huge market and it seems every soul there is crying out for
    Gallentean or Caldari or Jovian goods. The Amarrians like to regulate things,
    just to let you know who\u2019s got the power, and these Trade Fairs are a part
    of that. You can\u2019t just waltz into the Empire and start trading left and
    right. You have to have permission to trade certain goods. That\u2019s what these
    Trade Fairs are all about - establishing contacts, making trade agreements, getting
    permission, you get the picture.\u201D\n\n\u201CSo it\u2019s not a market fair,
    then?\u201D Naine asked. Gaspar shook his head.\n\n\u201CNo,\u201D he answered.
    \u201CThere\u2019s very little actual trading going on, it\u2019s all about making
    those connections.\u201D\n\n\u201CSir, I\u2019ve been waiting here since yesterday
    morning, when the fair started. Why are you running so late, the fair ends at
    midnight tonight?\u201D Naine inquired.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s all part of the head
    game.\u201D Gaspar said, tapping the side of his head. \u201CMy trade rivals will
    be thinking the exactly same thing. And the more they wonder, the more irritated
    they become, which is good for us. It\u2019s all a part of the Plan.\u201D Gaspar
    finished with a flourish, waving his hands in the air like he was talking about
    some religious experience. Then he laughed heartily and slapped Naine on the shoulders.\n\n\u201CVery
    clever, sir.\u201D Naine said, obviously wondering how much truth was in what
    Gaspar had just said.\n\n\u201CRemember, my dear Niedanai, appearance counts for
    everything.\u201D Gaspar said and looked at Naine\u2019s skeptical face. \u201CYou\u2019ll
    see.\u201D\n\nGaspar\u2019s suite was more of an apartment, with a huge living
    room and a luxurious bedroom. The suite was decorated in the latest Gallentean
    fashion, contrasting nicely with the somber but stylish Amarr fashion. Gaspar
    unloaded the cart robot in the living room and sent it rumbling back. Then he
    ushered Naine out of the room.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ll have to make some small preparations
    before we go to the main hall. I\u2019ll be with you in five.\u201D\n\nOnce the
    door had closed on Naine, Gaspar in a quick motion belying his former easy manners
    opened his briefcase, revealing a small portable computer. He plugged the computer
    into the station\u2019s public system. For the next few minutes his agile fingers
    tapped furiously at the keyboard, only stopping occasionally when he established
    contact with persons in other parts of the station and brief conversations ensued.
    Finally, he slapped the computer shut, locking it again down into his briefcase.
    Brushing down creases on his trousers, he then proceeded out into the corridor
    once more, where Naine was patiently waiting.\n\n\u201CReady, sir?\u201D Naine
    asked, the disdain in his voice over Gaspar\u2019s apparent fussiness over his
    physical appearance barely visible.\n\n\u201CReady for anything.\u201D Gaspar
    replied cheerfully, again embracing his jovial charismatic behavior as they set
    out for the elevators to the main hall.\n\n The floor of the main hall was an
    unblemished white marble and the ceiling was a sparkling glass dome, through which
    the lush Korridi planet was clearly visible. The effect was quite magnificent,
    something the Amarrians excelled in portraying. The sheer size of the hall seemed
    to engulf everyone in it and it almost had the appearance of being deserted. Numerous
    small groups of people were scattered around it, huddled together in discussion.
    The majority of those present were Amarrians, with Caldari and Gallenteans being
    of about equal number. There were even a few Jovians visible, but understandably
    not a single Minmatar was in sight. Waiters scurried around carrying trays stacked
    with glasses filled with every kind of drink imaginable.\n\nA gaudily dressed
    Gallentean waddled towards Gaspar and Naine. The man was obese and reeked of greed.\n\n\u201CI
    knew you would come, Gaspar you bastard!\u201D The man almost shrieked, turning
    a few heads in the vicinity. \u201CNot sure if could stomach another round against
    Anton, eh? I\u2019m telling you, this time you\u2019ll leave empty handed. Anton
    hasn\u2019t been idle in your absence, no he hasn\u2019t.\u201D\n\n\u201CWell,
    well, well, if it isn\u2019t the great Anton Ecumide. Master of shaky investments
    and lost deals.\u201D Gaspar replied, seemingly unruffled by Anton\u2019s rude
    manners.\n\n\u201CDon\u2019t you taunt me, Gaspar. It will only make you look
    all the more of a fool when I\u2019ve stolen each and every one of your deals
    from under your nose.\u201D Anton said and grinned nastily. It didn\u2019t help
    his appearance a bit.\n\n\u201CLet me introduce you, Niedanai this is the esteemed
    entrepreneur Anton Ecumide. Anton, this is my diplomatic attach\xE9 Niedanai Naine.\u201D
    Gaspar said, continuing to ignore Anton\u2019s outbursts.\n\n\u201CI see yours
    sticks to you like a fly on shit. How appropriate. I kicked mine out the moment
    I arrived. I believe he\u2019s sulking in some corner composing a complaint to
    his superiors.\u201D Anton said nastily.\n\n\u201CAw, I saw pity on the poor lad.
    I\u2019m teaching him the ropes of inter-racial trading.\u201D Gaspar said. Anton
    replied, addressing Naine:\n\n\u201CWatch out, boy. Don\u2019t let the manipulative
    bastard screw too much with your mind. As for you, Gaspar, I hope you\u2019ll
    sleep well tonight.\u201D With that Anton stormed away, giving Gaspar an evil
    side-look as he passed him.\n\n\u201CI can sense you two share a lot of history.\u201D
    Naine said to Gaspar once Anton was out of earshot.\n\n\u201CYes, our paths have
    crossed many times in the past. Old Anton never seems to get the breaks and he
    blames me for his bad fortune.\u201D Gaspar answered.\n\n\u201CAnd is he right?
    Are you to blame?\u201D Naine inquired. Gaspar just smiled, clasped his hands
    behind his back and ventured further into the hall at a leisurely pace.\n\nGaspar
    set the course for a couple of richly dressed Amarrians standing by themselves.
    Once close enough to be heard Gaspar said:\n\n\u201CGovernor Sed-Innad, you\u2019re
    looking older than ever.\u201D Naine jumped at the words, fearing the Amarrian
    would flare up at the insult. But when the older Amarrian just smiled he remembered
    that to the Amarrians looking old was a sign of maturity and stature. The younger
    Amarrian, probably still in his twenties, had even made obvious efforts to make
    himself look older than he actually was, thinning his hair and painting his face
    pale and gaunt. The older Amarrian, the one Gaspar had addressed as governor,
    was at least a century old. The two shook hands, they undoubtedly knew each other
    well.\n\n\u201CGaspar Anoun.\u201D The governor said warmly. \u201CSo you turned
    up after all.\u201D The old man indicated the younger Amarrian standing beside
    him and continued:\n\n\u201CThis is my nephew, Tarnak Nas-Innad. We\u2019re searching
    for a suitable position for him.\u201D The young man bowed a little to Gaspar.\n\n\u201COf
    course.\u201D Gaspar said nonchalantly. \u201CAfter all, next to despotism nepotism
    is the favorite past-time of the Amarrians, right? You guys never change.\u201D\n\n\u201CAnd
    neither do you, Gaspar. Always the witty one. One of these days your rude quips
    will become your bane.\u201D The governor replied, yet he didn\u2019t seem the
    least bit ruffled.\n\n\u201CForgive me, my lord.\u201D Gaspar said. \u201CUnfortunately
    Asslicking 101 wasn\u2019t on the curriculum at my school. Instead I had to learn
    such useless tasks as adding and subtracting. Such a pity.\u201D By now Naine
    was literally jumping from foot to foot in his anxiety, fearing the worst.\n\n\u201CGentlemen,
    meet my diplomatic attach\xE9, Niedanai Naine. He seems a little agitated at the
    moment.\u201D Gaspar said and turned to Naine. \u201CWhat\u2019s the matter? You
    need to use the little boys room?\u201D Naine, noticing that the Amarrians were
    still calm despite Gaspar\u2019s words, composed himself.\n\n\u201CNo, sir. I\u2019m
    fine. Don\u2019t mind me.\u201D He finally murmured. Gaspar turned back to governor
    Sed-Innad.\n\n\u201CHow\u2019s the wheeling and dealing going?\u201D The governor
    asked.\n\n\u201CI just got here. No time to screw anybody over yet.\u201D Gaspar
    answered jokingly.\n\n\u201CAnd the Upper Debyl deal?\u201D The governor inquired,
    taking a sip from his glass.\n\n\u201COn schedule. It can proceed.\u201D Gaspar
    answered, giving Naine a glance. The governor stood silent for a minute, sipping
    his wine.\n\n\u201CSo what\u2019s this I\u2019m hearing about you trading in Caldari
    wares, Gaspar?\u201D He finally asked.\n\n\u201CPure coincidence. I happened upon
    this heap of excellent Caldari scanner systems a while ago. Dead cheap. You know
    I\u2019m not scrupulous about what I sell. Or to whom.\u201D Gaspar answered.\n\n\u201CWell,
    lucky for you then. Scanner systems are always in demand. Anywhere.\u201D The
    governor said innocently.\n\n\u201CMy thought exactly, governor.\u201D Gaspar
    said. \u201CNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to mingle a bit.\u201D
    The Amarrians nodded their heads in farewell and Gaspar and Naine did the same.
    Then Gaspar set out for a group of Caldari standing near the main entrance. Naine
    took the opportunity to berate Gaspar.\n\n\u201CWhat you did was very dangerous,
    sir. The governor could easily have been offended and where would you stand then?\u201D
    He said.\n\n\u201CMe and governor Sed-Innad go way back, Naine. He\u2019s as close
    to being a friend of mine as an Amarr Holder can be. Besides, I\u2019ve told you,
    it pays to get people on the edge.\u201D Gaspar answered.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m still
    not convinced of that, sir.\u201D Naine said sourly.\n\n\u201CLook, it\u2019s
    very simple.\u201D Gaspar explained. \u201CBoth the Amarrians and the Caldari
    put a huge stock in maintaining their dignity and posture. If you crack that mask
    a little by unorthodox behavior you make them uneasy, unsure of the situation.
    Pierce that crack a bit more open and before long you have them eating out of
    your hand. And that, my dear Niedanai, is the whole idea.\u201D\n\nBy now they
    were very close to the Caldari group. Naine saw by the military uniforms some
    of them wore that they were representatives of the CBD Corporation. The Gallenteans
    stopped just outside the little group. The Caldari ignored them for a few minutes,
    on purpose no doubt, trying to gain the upper hand in the upcoming discussion.
    Finally, one of them, apparently the head of the delegation turned towards them.
    He was a tall, grim-looking man in a military uniform.\n\n \u201CI\u2019m major
    Ati Mittuchi.\u201D The man gave a brief military salute. \u201CWhom do I have
    the pleasure of conversing with?\u201D He continued in a formal tone, looking
    questioningly at Gaspar and Naine.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m Gaspar Anoun, this is my
    diplomatic attach\xE9 Niedanai Naine.\u201D Gaspar said, giving a mock salute
    in response, something that didn\u2019t go down too well with the Caldari.\n\n\u201CAh,
    so you\u2019re Anoun.\u201D The major said. \u201CI should have recognized you
    by your flamboyant arrogance.\u201D\n\n\u201CThe one and only.\u201D Gaspar said,
    showing no sign of irritation over the major\u2019s insult. \u201CTell me major,
    this is a Trade Fair. Where\u2019s the war? Why this military showdown?\u201D\n\n\u201CThe
    Amarrians respect power, Mr. Anoun. They, like everybody else, want to make sure
    that what they\u2019ve bargained for gets delivered in one piece. Now, with all
    those pesky Minmatars pirates around, the Amarrians appreciate all assurances
    that the border-zone trade routes are safe.\u201D The major said confidently.\n\n\u201CSo
    you\u2019re giving a safe delivery guarantees? That must cost a bit.\u201D Gaspar
    said.\n\n\u201COur trade package is very reasonably priced, Mr. Anoun. And most
    importantly, for a few extra credits every item is guaranteed to arrive safe and
    sound. That\u2019s naturally much better than never getting anything at all.\u201D\n\n\u201CIs
    it?\u201D Gaspar looked surprised. \u201CGosh! I never would have thought of that.
    You Caldari sure do think things through.\u201D The major seemed to inflate with
    smugness. Beneath that dignified exterior hid a pompous man Naine thought. And
    Gaspar flushed him out right away with some silly sarcasm, something most people
    saw right through.\n\n\u201CWell, too bad for you then that the Amarrians are
    planning on dealing with me.\u201D Gaspar continued. The major exhaled, his face
    turning red.\n\n\u201CWhat?\u201D He shouted. \u201CSo you\u2019re the one that
    have been offering our scanners to the Amarrians at a ridiculous price, eh? Well,
    I\u2019m interested to know were you got your product from, Mr. Anoun. I wouldn\u2019t
    be the least surprised if we found out that these were stolen goods. Ah, ah, don\u2019t
    look so offended, Mr. Anoun, it isn\u2019t your style. So, can you show us legitimate
    papers to certify where you acquired the scanners?\u201D Suddenly the Caldari
    seemed more menacing, looming over the two Gallenteans. Gaspar took his time reaching
    for a glass from a passing waiters\u2019 tray and taking a sip before answering
    the major\u2019s accusations.\n\n\u201CYour paranoia amuses me, major. I will
    indulge your interest. I got them from Yria Base.\u201D Gaspar reached into his
    pocket and produced an id-chip, handing it to the major. \u201CCheck this out.
    It should satisfy your curiosity.\u201D The major gave the chip to one of his
    assistants, who inserted it into his palm computer. He scanned his screen for
    a few minutes before speaking.\n\n\u201CThe chip seems to be authentic, sir.\u201D
    The assistant said.\n\n\u201CJust to make sure contact Yria Base, check their
    logs.\u201D The major said, handing the id-chip back to Gaspar. The assistant
    established wireless contact to the Korridi station\u2019s mainframe and requested
    a com link to Yria Base. Gaspar put the chip back in his pocket and Naine noticed
    he seemed to finger something in his pocket for a second before retrieving his
    hand. The assistant fiddled with his palm computer for a minute before speaking
    again:\n\n\u201CSir, we\u2019re unable to establish contact with Yria Base, there\u2019s
    some interference. The Amarrians think it\u2019s one of these sun flare phenomenons.\u201D
    The major seemed disappointed.\n\n\u201CWell, Mr. Anoun. How fortunate for you.
    You seemed to be sweating there.\u201D He said.\n\n\u201CThe idea of all the credits
    I\u2019ll make on these scanners tonight makes me all hot, major.\u201D Gaspar
    teased. The major frowned.\n\n\u201CGood evening to you, Mr. Anoun. And don\u2019t
    expect to get lucky every time.\u201D He said and prepared to leave.\n\n\u201CBelieve
    me, major. Luck has nothing to do with it.\u201D Gaspar replied and raised his
    glass in farewell. Gaspar and Naine watched the Caldari delegation depart, the
    major cursing the poor assistant for his incompetence.\n\n\u201CCome, Niedanai,
    lets return to my suite. \u201C Gaspar said and started to leave the main hall.
    Naine was stunned.\n\n\u201CBut, Mr. Anoun, you just got here. You haven\u2019t
    made any deals yet.\u201D He said.\n\n\u201CThere are still two hours till midnight.
    Plenty of time.\u201D Gaspar said while they waited for an elevator.\n\n\u201CIf
    I may say so, sir, I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re trying to outbid the
    Caldari on their own product, it seems so far fetched. And what is this Upper
    Debyl deal you and the governor were talking about?\u201D Naine asked, his curiosity
    getting the better of his manners.\n\n\u201CIt will all be revealed in good time,
    my dear Niedanai. For now, let\u2019s just say that I\u2019m playing the head
    game for the high stakes. It\u2019s all about keeping your adversaries occupied.\u201D
    Gaspar answered as they entered the elevator. Once the elevator\u2019s door had
    closed behind them Gaspar fetched a palm computer from his pocket. He frowned
    at it for a moment.\n\n\u201CIt seems my palmer is out at the moment. Can I borrow
    yours for a second? I just have to send one simple message.\u201D Gaspar asked.\n\n\u201CUh,
    sure. Here you go, sir.\u201D Naine handed Gaspar his palm computer. Gaspar operated
    it quickly and efficiently and finished before the elevator reached their floor.
    Nothing more was said before they came to the double-doors leading to Gaspar\u2019s
    suite. Gaspar spent some time staring at the doors like he was expecting them
    to open on their own. Finally the two of them entered the suite. Gaspar sat by
    his desk and once again opened his briefcase with the portable computer. He established
    a com link and briefly chatted with a Gallentean on the other end.\n\n\u201CWho
    was that?\u201D Naine asked when Gaspar had closed his briefcase.\n\n\u201CThat
    was my good friend Barridour. He\u2019s organizing a little something for me later
    tonight.\u201D Gaspar answered. Naine stood mulling things over for a while before
    he poured himself a glass of water from a jug on a side table.\n\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t
    drink that if I was you.\u201D Gaspar said as Naine raised the glass to his lips.\n\n\u201CEh?
    Why not?\u201D Naine asked.\n\n\u201CBecause there is a sleeping potion in there.
    It will put you to sleep for the rest of the night.\u201D Gaspar answered.\n\n\u201CHow
    do you know?\u201D Naine said, putting the glass down.\n\n\u201CBecause the fool
    Anton Ecumide more or less blurted it out when we ran into him. And when I noticed
    that someone had fiddled with the lock on our door it was easy to figure out.
    But now, we must ready ourselves for the night. Don\u2019t you have anything better
    to wear than that wrinkled suit?\u201D Gaspar asked. Naine looked down on his
    suit.\n\n\u201CUh, yeah. I\u2019ve got a spare suit.\u201D He answered.\n\n\u201CGood,
    why don\u2019t you change into that and meet me here in 15 minutes?\u201D Gaspar
    said.\n\n\u201CVery well, sir. But I can be ready in five.\u201D Naine said.\n\n\u201CBut
    I can\u2019t, Mr. Naine. Fifteen minutes, ok?\u201D Gaspar said. Once Naine was
    out of the room, Gaspar once more got his portable computer out of the briefcase
    and fired it up. First one to appear on his screen was governor Sed-Innad.\n\n\u201CWell?\u201D
    Gaspar asked.\n\n\u201CHe bought it. Double what we\u2019d figured.\u201D The
    governor said smiling. \u201CAnd the Caldari?\u201D He asked.\n\n\u201CThey took
    the bait. Expect to haul them in later tonight.\u201D Gaspar answered. \u201CThat
    only leaves our little deal\u2026\u201D He finished.\n\n\u201CYes, of course.
    I\u2019ll give you the confirmation later tonight. And the guards you asked for
    will be ready, as you requested.\u201D The governor replied.\n\n\u201CGood, good.
    Then all is settled. See you tonight.\u201D Gaspar said and cut off the link.
    He established another connection. This time a serene Jovian face appeared on
    the screen.\n\nNaine was waiting patiently outside in the corridor when Gaspar
    left his suite some ten minutes later. Naine looked marginally better in a light
    gray suit, but still left a lot to be desired.\n\n\u201CWhere are we going, sir?\u201D
    Naine asked.\n\n\u201CNow, my dear Niedanai, I\u2019m going to show you how real
    Gallenteans conduct their business.\u201D Gaspar exclaimed. \u201CUntil now we\u2019ve
    been playing by the business books of the Amarrian and the Caldari - boring conversation
    between somber men making somber deals that might earn their grandchildren a nickel.
    They\u2019re always complimenting themselves how smart they are in their long
    term planning, but there\u2019s no fun in it Niedanai, no fun in it at all. I
    mean look at them. They labor like ants around the clock, setting aside some measly
    sum so they can go on some lame space cruising when they\u2019ve become too old
    and spent to work anymore. They\u2019re spending their youth toiling away so they
    can have a bit of fun when they\u2019re 150 years old. Too old to have any real
    fun, as I see it. Where\u2019s the logic in that, I ask you? You know what their
    problem is?\u201D Gaspar paused, obviously expecting some kind of an answer from
    Naine.\n\n\u201CUh, I don\u2019t know, sir. What\u2019s the problem?\u201D Naine
    ventured.\n\n\u201CThey\u2019re too fixed up on keeping work and leisure separate.
    To them, the two things don\u2019t go together. But we Gallentean traders know
    that work and leisure go very well together, they\u2019re just two sides of the
    same coin. Meaningful playing and playful working, that\u2019s what I always say.\u201D
    Gaspar finished his speech just as the two reached a large double-door at the
    end of a corridor.\n\n\u201CAnd now, Niedanai, I\u2019ll show just what I mean.\u201D
    With that Gaspar threw the doors open. Loud noise and bright lights engulfed Naine,
    battering his every sense. Behind the doors was a large room and at the moment
    it was filled with laughing, shouting people. There was a wild party going on.
    The attendants were mostly other Gallenteans, but a number of Amarrians and some
    Caldari were also to be seen.\n\n \u201CWhat do you think?\u201D Gaspar shouted
    over the din.\n\n\u201CI don\u2019t know, sir. What\u2019s going on?\u201D Naine
    asked clearly bewildered.\n\n\u201CThis is what I was organizing. This is playful
    work, or meaningful playing, which ever you prefer, in it\u2019s purest form.\u201D
    Gaspar said and then dived into the crowd.\n\nGaspar quickly got into his host
    gear, walking among the guests, shaking hands with many and sharing a brief chat
    with some. Naine trailed behind, trying to grasp the situation.\n\nIn one of the
    corners Gaspar came upon Anton Ecumide seated with couple of girls on each arm.
    The man was already well drunk. When he saw Gaspar he cackled loudly and shouted:\n\n\u201CGaspar!
    I bet you\u2019re wishing you were asleep right now because I stole the Upper
    Debyl system from right under your nose, just as I promised!\u201D Anton laughed
    loudly, enjoying his victory to the fullest. Gaspar seemed a little taken aback.\n\n\u201CHow
    did you know\u2026?\u201D He stammered. \u201CWell, never mind. Say, Anton, I\u2019ll
    buy it back from you. Whatever you paid plus 50% extra, that\u2019s a hefty profit
    right there.\u201D He said, looking hopeful.\n\n\u201CIn your dreams. That system
    is mine. You\u2019ll never get it!\u201D Anton laughed again, even louder this
    time. Gaspar, dejected, walked away. Anton\u2019s shrill laughter chasing his
    heavy steps. Naine followed Gaspar, wanting to comfort him but unsure how to go
    about it without embarrassing him even more. Once they were close to the entrance
    Gaspar whispered quietly to Naine:\n\n\u201CCan he see us?\u201D Naine looked
    back, Anton was hidden from view by a happy throng of party-goers.\n\n\u201CNo,
    the crowd is in the way.\u201D Naine replied.\n\n\u201CGood.\u201D Gaspar said
    and then he lifted his slumped shoulders and unwrinkled his saddened face. The
    old Gaspar was back again, jolly as always.\n\n\u201CWell, Naine. That went rather
    well, didn\u2019t you think?\u201D He said merrily. Naine felt his head spinning.\n\n\u201CBut,
    sir. Anton just bought the system you were after.\u201D He said.\n\n\u201CYes,
    he did.\u201D Gaspar said. \u201CAnd do you know why I was after it?\u201D He
    asked with a twinkle in his eye.\n\n\u201CWell, I guess because there\u2019s something
    of value there.\u201D\n\n\u201CNo, the system is totally and utterly void of anything
    interesting or valuable. I was after it because I wanted Anton to buy it.\u201D
    Gaspar said. Suddenly it dawned on Naine:\n\n\u201CI see, sir. You knew that if
    Anton heard about your interest in the system, then he would become interested
    in it. So you deliberately started the rumor that you wanted to buy it. Very clever,
    sir. But from whom did Anton buy it? No! Don\u2019t answer, let me guess. Governor
    Sed-Innad, right?\n\n\u201CWell, the governor\u2019s brother actually. But otherwise
    you\u2019re correct in your assumptions, well done. You might have a future in
    politics after all.\u201D Gaspar said. Naine beamed. Gaspar spotted governor Sed-Innad
    and his nephew. He waved them to come over. Then he leaned towards Naine and said:\n\n\u201CMeet
    me at my suite in one hour. I\u2019ve got some business to discuss and then some
    hard partying to do.\u201D Then Gaspar took Naine\u2019s arm and led him to a
    sofa where two Gallentean beauties were seated. \u201CWhy don\u2019t you in the
    meantime get on first name basis with my friends over here?\u201D Gaspar whispered
    into Naine\u2019s ear and steered him down into the sofa.\n\n\u201CSir, are you
    sure about this?\u201D Naine wailed in near panic as the two girls leaned into
    him on both sides.\n\n\u201COne hour, remember that!\u201D Was all Gaspar shouted
    as he led the Amarrians away into the crowd.\n\nAn hour later a sweaty but happy
    Gaspar rounded the corner to his suite. It didn\u2019t surprise him all that much
    to see Naine already waiting in front of the door. His hair was tangled and his
    cloths disheveled.\n\n\u201CSo, did you get on ok with the girls?\u201D Gaspar
    asked him as he led them into his suite.\n\n\u201CThey\u2026 they we\u2019re like
    animals!\u201D Naine exclaimed, clearly still flustered from his encounter.\n\n\u201COoo!
    You lucky man!\u201D Gaspar said smiling. The two men entered the living room.
    Two heavyset Amarrians were seated near the door. They stood up when Gaspar and
    Naine came in.\n\n\u201CAh, gentlemen.\u201D Gaspar said, not the least surprised
    to see the two Amarrians there. Gaspar seated himself while the Amarrians planted
    themselves on either side of Naine.\n\n\u201CWell, Naine. I\u2019m afraid this
    is the end of the road for you.\u201D Gaspar signaled the Amarrians, which promptly
    pinned Naine\u2019s arms to his sides. Naine\u2019s face registered astonishment
    and fear in equal proportions.\n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the meaning of this? I will
    let you know that I\u2019m employee of the Foreign Ministry, they\u2019ll surely
    hear about this and then it\u2019s the end of the road for you, pal.\u201D Naine
    said, anger welling up in him.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m afraid not. The Foreign Ministry
    has fired you and absolved themselves from any fate that may befall you. And your
    fate is in my hand.\u201D Gaspar said harshly. \u201CI can see you\u2019re confused,
    Mr. Naine. I\u2019ll make things a bit clearer for you. I know that you\u2019re
    a Caldari agent.\u201D Naine licked his lips, but otherwise his face was impassive.
    For a minute neither man said a word, then Naine spoke:\n\n\u201CYou come here
    all high and mighty, constantly making boisterous remarks and outrageous claims.
    But now you have gone too far. I\u2019m afraid I cannot let these accusations
    go unanswered.\u201D He said, sounding confidant, but sweating profusely.\n\n\u201CDon\u2019t
    bother with the lies and denials.\u201D Gaspar said. He reached into his pocket
    and produced a small data-vis chip. He activated it and a pale hologram sprouted
    from the floor between the pair. Even if it was grainy and occasionally out of
    focus the men in the hologram were clearly the Gallentean diplomatic attach\xE9
    Niedanai Naine and major Ati Mittuchi of CBD Corporation. The two were conversing
    in hushed tones in a bar or restaurant it seemed.\n\n\u201CDo you want me to turn
    the sound up?\u201D Gaspar said. \u201CIt\u2019s pretty condemning, what with
    you spilling your guts about all sorts of interesting issues supposedly a secret.
    I have a whole stack of these holograms.\u201D Naine seemed to go weak at the
    knees, slumping like a drunken man. Then he contemplated for a moment trying to
    escape the steel grips of the hulking Amarrians, but thought better off it.\n\n\u201CYour
    fate is sealed, my dear Niedanai.\u201D Gaspar said, driving the facts home.\n\n\u201CWhat
    made you suspect me?\u201D Naine finally moaned pathetically, seeing no point
    in trying to deny anything anymore. He was clearly crestfallen, his little world
    collapsing around him.\n\n\u201CHuh! You\u2019re more Caldari-like than many Caldari
    I know. You practically reek of being their spy.\u201D Gaspar answered. \u201CAll
    I needed was a confirmation and I got it earlier tonight from a Jovian contact
    I have. Do you know what I had to pay for a proof? Do you know what you\u2019re
    worth to the Jovians?\u201D Gaspar taunted. Naine shook his head.\n\n\u201CA rock.
    A medium sized rock from Gallente Prime. Not a special rock at all, just\u2026
    a rock. Don\u2019t you find that funny?\u201D Naine vas visibly shaking by now,
    his body hanging limb between the Amarrian strongmen. Gaspar continued:\n\n\u201CBut
    then again I understand that is the standard price for a Caldari spy: a medium
    sized rock from Gallente Prime. Weird, don\u2019t you think? If you ask me I think
    the Jovians are conducting a little experiment. Are there more Caldari spies within
    the Gallente Federation than there are medium sized rocks on Gallente Prime? I
    don\u2019t know, maybe one day we\u2019ll have to go to the Jovian Empire to visit
    our ancestral planet.\u201D Gaspar let out a short laugh at the thought.\n\n\u201CWhat
    are you going to do to me?\u201D Naine whispered.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m selling you
    to the Amarrians.\u201D Gaspar said coldly. \u201COh, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll
    be well cared for, you\u2019re going to one of their better slave plantations.
    I gather the work is not so hard there once you get used to the heat. I hear they
    got a slave spokesman there, sort of like a union leader. I\u2019m sure if you
    put the things I\u2019ve taught you tonight to good use you can work your way
    up to it. And until then, remember, playful working. Take him away, boys.\u201D
    The Amarrians started dragging Naine towards the door.\n\n\u201CWait, wait!\u201D
    Naine wailed. \u201CAnswer me just one question. How did the Caldari deal go?\u201D
    Gaspar motioned the guards to halt. Then he withdrew the id-chip from his pocket
    and threw it at Naine\u2019s feet.\n\n \u201CThat chip is a phony, Mr. Naine.
    Just like you.\u201D Gaspar said. \u201CIt was all a ruse, a bit of a trickery
    by me and governor Sed-Innad. He got the Caldari to lower their price by 15%,
    I\u2019ll get a share of the profit and my own little deal involving Gallentean-made
    ship thrusters went through smoothly, what with all my rivals focusing on something
    entirely different. I guess major Mittuchi is quite pleased with himself at the
    moment for \u2018outbidding\u2019 my Caldari scanners, but I\u2019m not so sure
    if his superiors will agree when they discover that I\u2019ve never bought any
    scanners on Yria Base. That\u2019s what happens when they send amateur negotiators
    to do a real man\u2019s work. Goodbye, Mr. Naine.\u201D The two guards dragged
    the whimpering man out of the suite.\n\nGaspar sat down at his desk, pouring himself
    a stiff drink and DNA drug tested it before sipping. He ran the events of the
    day through his head. The thruster deal alone netted a hefty 200% profit and his
    share of the Upper Debyl sale and the Caldari deal was not too shabby either.
    Firing up his portable computer he scanned his diary, making a few notes and reflecting
    upon those things next on the agenda. He established connection with the station
    management office.\n\n\u201CWake me up at 7 am tomorrow.\u201D He said to the
    receptionist, glancing at his timepiece. \u201CAnd can you contact the docking
    bay and make them have my ship prepared at 8 am?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes, sir. Have
    a good night.\u201D The receptionist answered. Gaspar leaned back in the chair,
    taking another sip.\n\n\u2018Tomorrow its Hrokkur station for those sly Krusuals
    and their contraband goods. And the day after\u2026 Well, lets not waste today
    thinking too much about future days. I\u2019ll play it by the ear as always.\u2019
    Gaspar thought. Saluting himself in the mirror he drank the rest of the spirit
    and went to bed."

  The monotonous voice of the command tower\u2019s personnel sounded even more bored
  than Gaspar Anoun was feeling. Although the journey had been short and relatively
  uneventful it was always tiresome to deal with Amarr custom officials, and Gaspar
  had met a lot of them in the last few hours since his arrival into Amarr space.
  The Amarr station loomed large above him, [...]"
