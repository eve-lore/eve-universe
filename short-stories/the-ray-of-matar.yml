    the bloated Rock perched itself on the top of the new mountain, gloating and wallowing
    in its own self-esteem.\n\n\u2018Look, Mountain,\u2019 the Rock said. \u2018Look
    at me on top of my own mountain.\u2019 But the Mountain answered: \u2018Foolish
    Rock, look beneath you. Your mountain is weak. It cannot support you.\u2019\n\nThe
    Rock looked down, and saw it was true. Its mountain was feeble, frail. The Rock
    could hear all the little rocks in the mountain groaning beneath its weight.\n\n\u2018Maybe
    my mountain will crumble, but I got to the top, as I set out to do; I fulfilled
    my dream.\u2019 the Rock righteously said to the Mountain.\n\n\u2018Yes, but then
    what?\u2019 The Mountain enquired. \u2018You had a good place on the side of me;
    you were in the light, with the wind caressing you and the sun warming you and
    the moss licking you.\u2019\n\nSuddenly the little mountain the Rock had erected
    collapsed. The Rock felt itself being dragged down; it toppled down the mountain
    side and all the little rocks came in its wake. It hit the ground and the little
    rocks piled in front and back and the sides and on top the Rock. It was trapped
    beneath all the small rocks that it had gathered for its mountain; they squeezed
    it tight and the Rock felt like suffocating.\n\n\u2018Mountain!\u2019 it wheezed
    weakly. \u2018Help me!\u2019\n\n\u2018What can I do?\u2019 the Mountain said.
    \u2018You brought this onto yourself. You couldn\u2019t be satisfied with the
    place I gave to you; you had to get to the top. And now look at you, trapped beneath
    your own mountain forever.\u2019\n\n\u2018But it was my dream,\u2019 the Rock
    sobbed, \u2018everybody has got to have a dream.\u2019\n\n\u2018Not if your dream
    is based on a fantasy, rather than reality.\u2019 The Mountain replied sagely
    and went back to sleep.\u201D\n\nVormar finished the story with a small bow and
    Karin started breathing again. She didn\u2019t hold her breath through the whole
    story, that was humanly impossible, but she always held her breath during the
    last part of the story, when the Rock was smothered under its own mountain. Maybe
    she did it to empathize with the Rock; as a child Karin always took the side of
    the Rock in its struggle with the evil Mountain. That was before she understood
    the metaphorical meaning of the story and realized the folly of the Rock\u2019s
    actions. But the story had always remained one of her favorites and the chance
    to hear it now from a master storyteller like Vormar enchanted her even more.\n\nPeople
    thronged the large, dimly lit tent. The tent was at the apex of a small camp situated
    close to the sacred ground. Karin\u2019s eyes were watering because of the smoke
    in the tent and her buttocks were sore from the uncomfortable cushion she sat
    on. But the tents were the only dwellings allowed within miles of the sacred ground,
    a tradition refurbished after the rebellion to give people a better feeling for
    the ancient rituals and ceremonies performed at the place. One of these ceremonies
    was to take place that night and Karin was to participate in it. This was the
    most important ceremony in a Minmatars life, called Voluval or the Test of Destiny.
    In the Voluval a Minmatar faced his true inner-self and, most importantly, the
    findings would permanently mark the body for all to see. Karin was to participate
    that night.\n\nVormar was her essence instructor. His responsibility was to educate
    those undergoing the test on what it involved and prepare them mentally for it.\n\nKarin
    was thankful to Vormar for telling them the story of the Rock and the Mountain,
    for it calmed her nerves for the upcoming event. She approached Vormar at the
    back of the tent where he was putting away his battered copy of Minmatar folk
    tales; he didn\u2019t actually read from the book, but in his old age he felt
    comfort in having it at hand in case his memory suddenly failed.\n\n\u201CAh,
    Karin,\u201D Vormar said when she entered his field of vision. \u201CWhat can
    I do for you?\u201D\n\n\u201CWell, it\u2019s about my tattoos\u2026\u201D Karin
    began hesitantly.\n\n\"Yes, your tattoos.\u201D The old man said. \u201CYou\u2019re
    unsure what motif to go for, right?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes, that\u2019s it.\u201D
    Karin said. \u201CWell, as I\u2019m a slave-child and all that. Not knowing my
    family clan\u2026\u201D\n\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019re of the Minmatar
    tribe Sebiestor; that\u2019s what is most important.\u201D Vormar said and smiled
    reassuringly.\n\n\u201CBut what family clan motif should I choose? I might upset
    somebody by my choice\u2026\u201D\n\n\u201CNot all families have a motif and not
    all motifs are associated with a specific family.\u201D Vormar said. \u201CHere,
    let me show you something.\u201D The old sage started rummaging in his trunk.
    After a while he produced a large leather-bound book.\n\n\u201CMy father gave
    me this book when I was your age.\u201D He said. \u201CIt illustrates and explains
    everything you want to know about tattoos. Take a look at it, maybe it will help
    you decide what motif you want.\u201D Vormar handed Karin the book. She opened
    it at random. The page showed a picture of a tattooed man, with explanations for
    each tattoo.\n\n\u201CThis book was published shortly after the rebellion.\u201D
    Vormar continued. \u201CWhile we were under the yoke of the Amarrians they systematically
    tried to erase many of our most sacred traditions; tattooing amongst them. This
    book was intended to re-introduce this ancient custom to those that had never
    experienced it. Admittedly not all modern motifs are in it, but all of the old
    major ones are there. I\u2019ve used it before to teach slave-children such as
    you about tattooing. You can borrow it for a few days.\u201D\n\nKarin flicked
    through the aged tome, examining the finally drafted images. She already knew
    the gist of the tattooing tradition; that part of the face was reserved for the
    clan tattoo and the shoulders for rank tattoos. She also knew that facial war
    tattoos based on nano technology were very popular among the younger generations.
    This special type of tattoo could appear and disappear depending on the emotional
    state of the person. Like all Minmatar children in the Republic, Karin had picked
    up this basic knowledge of tattoos at an early age. But she was still uncertain
    about what kind of tattoos to choose and now that the Voluval was fast approaching
    the time was running out, as she was allowed to get tattoos once the ceremony
    was over. It wasn\u2019t exactly essential to make the selection now; many only
    did so after they saw what mark they got. But for Karin the selection meant more
    than just decorating her body, to her the tattoo motif revealed and reinforced
    her identity, something she had always struggled with, being a slave-child.\n\nKarin
    sat down in the far corner of the tent to look more closely at the book Vormar
    had given her. In half an hour Vormar would give the last lesson to her and the
    other adolescents preparing for the Voluval in his role as their essence instructor
    and she intended to use these few minutes to study the tattoo book. But when she
    had just started a commotion in another corner of the tent distracted her. Mattmar
    Graur and a few of his friends were light-heartedly arguing with some girls. Karin
    noticed that Mattmar gave her a smile and a wink when he noticed her looking at
    him and she quickly looked down at the book again. \u2018The silly fool\u2019
    she thought. She involuntarily ran through the events of last night in her head.\n\nKarin
    was sitting on the flat roof of the tent-house of Graur at the outskirts of the
    camp. Troinn Graur was the richest merchant in Karin\u2019s hometown of Mithuris,
    and his son and heir, Mattmar Graur, was sitting beside her. They had been friends
    since childhood, but since Mattmar hit puberty they\u2019d sort of drifted apart.
    Mattmar became pompous, vain and superficial, all traits that Karin loathed. But
    their mutual trepidation for the upcoming test tomorrow night made them seek each
    other out for support.\n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s on your mind, Karin?\u201D Mattmar
    asked, watching her stare at the night sky.\n\n\u201CYou should know.\u201D Karin
    answered after some pause.\n\n\u201CHow could I know?\u201D Mattmar laughed, \u201CI\u2019m
    not a mind-reader.\u201D\n\n\u201CWell, I know what\u2019s on your mind.\u201D
    she replied, leaning backwards on her hands and staring even more intently at
    the stars above.\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s because I always have the same thing on
    my mind.\u201D Mattmar said with a twinkle in his eye and moved closer to Karin.
    Karin paid him no attention.\n\n\u201CWhat are you going to do after the ceremony
    tomorrow?\u201D She asked him.\n\n\u201CI dunno, depends on my mark, I suppose.\u201D
    He answered, obviously not all that comfortable talking about it. Karin looked
    at him.\n\n\u201CYou haven\u2019t thought about your mark?\u201D\n\n\u201CNo,
    why should I? It\u2019s all subconscious anyway,\u201D Mattmar said, adding: \u201CAnd
    besides, almost all males in my family get the same basic mark: an upside-down
    triangle with two spokes at the top; the bull-mark. I\u2019ll probably get the
    same.\u201D\n\nKarin saw that he was far from being as confidant about it as he
    would let her belief, but decided not to press him about it. She was nervous enough
    about her own mark as it was. She feared she would get one of the degrading marks:
    the spiraling circle; the scarecrow; the purple cross; or any of the numerous
    other marks that could forever exile you from Minmatar society. Fortunately this
    didn\u2019t happen often; Karin had only witnessed it once, when she was six years
    old. A teenage boy got the worst mark there was: the pale eye. The poor boy had
    been driven away from the town, not even his family was willing to recognize him,
    let alone help him. The memory still sent shivers down Karin\u2019s spine and
    she huddled closer to Mattmar. Of course the boy misinterpreted this for a sign
    of affection and he tried to put his hand around her shoulders. She shook him
    off.\n\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Mattmar said in mock surprise. This wasn\u2019t the
    first time he tried it and failed. Suddenly Karin flared up, all her uncertainties
    and inner anxiety bursting out.\n\n\u201CWhat!? I tell you what, Mattmar Graur.
    Tomorrow you\u2019ll be tested, tomorrow you\u2019ll find out what future lies
    ahead of you, and you shrug it off like it was unimportant. I remember the time
    when we could talk about the future, our dreams, but now\u2026 Now, all you want
    to do is hang around with the guys and ogle the girls. What happened, man?\u201D
    Karin shook her dark tresses in disgust.\n\n\u201CHey, chill out kid. I care for
    the future. I just find it smarter to live in the now, rather than to constantly
    dwell on the future.\u201D Mattmar leaned towards Karin, his tone suddenly more
    serious. \u201CTo tell you the truth, I dream of becoming a High Justice.\u201D\n\n\u201CWell,
    in that case you should spend more time on your school books than on partying.
    With your grades you\u2019re lucky if you get to be a waiter in a Vherokior diner.\u201D
    Karin said teasingly.\n\n\u201CAw, come on. I\u2019ve got brains.\u201D Mattmar
    replied. \u201CPlus, daddy has some friends in high places; he can get me an internship
    in the Justice Department. And once I\u2019ve got my foot inside the door\u2026\u201D
    He thrust his hand upwards. \u201CI\u2019ll shoot straight for the stars.\u201D
    He finished, laughing.\n\n\u201CSo, it seems you\u2019ve got it all figured out.\u201D
    Karin said.\n\n\u201CSure I do. I always have and always will. What about you?
    I bet you have some fanciful dreams for the future.\u201D Mattmar asked.\n\n\u201CYes\u2026\u201D
    Karin said reluctantly, unsure of how wise it was to confide in Mattmar. \u201CIt\u2019s
    only fair I tell you, right? Well, I feel deeply about the poor situation we Minmatars
    are in today.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat are you talking about, kid?\u201D Mattmar said.
    \u201CWe threw out the Amarrians, we\u2019re free.\u201D\n\n\u201CMaybe so, but
    we\u2019re still divided into multiple factions. The Republic is nothing but a
    loosely united assembly of factions, each seemingly with the only agenda to disrupt
    and disintegrate the state. We can\u2019t extend our political thought beyond
    the clan and it\u2019s tearing us apart. The result is that the Minmatars are
    scattered throughout our world of EVE; billions of them are still enslaved within
    the Amarr Empire and we don\u2019t have the wits to pull ourselves together to
    free them.\u201D Karin paused for breath.\n\n\u201CSo we all hate the Amarr Empire.\u201D
    Mattmar chimed in. \u201CDon\u2019t worry your pretty little head over these big
    issues.\u201D\n\n\u201CI do worry, I\u2019m slave-child, remember. My parents
    risked their lives getting me smuggled out of Amarr space and they\u2019re still
    there, slaves to some hideous Amarrian.\u201D Karin almost shouted, her anger
    and frustration again getting the better of her.\n\n\u201CWe do fight the Amarrians,
    we\u2019re doing our best.\u201D Mattmar said soothingly.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019re
    not fighting the Amarrians, we\u2019re fighting the Ammatars, our own cousins.\u201D\n\n\u201CThose
    scums deserve to die, we\u2019ll finish them off and then the Amarrians.\u201D
    Mattmar responded.\n\n\u201CNo, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to tell you.
    The Ammatars aren\u2019t our real enemy. The Amarrians just play them off against
    us, keeping us both occupied. But if we\u2019d unite we could take out the Amarrians
    for good.\u201D Karin said heatedly.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s impossible, we can never
    unite with the Ammatars.\u201D Mattmar said. \u201CMany have tried, and failed.
    You don\u2019t want to become a failure, now do you?\u201D\n\n\u201CI don\u2019t
    care, all I know is that uniting the Minmatars is something I\u2019m willing to
    fight for, even die for.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou know, it\u2019s fanatics like you
    that give the rest of us a bad image.\u201D Mattmar said, obviously tired of listening
    to what he considered to be silly ravings.\n\n\u201CNo!\u201D Karin screamed and
    jumped to her feet. \u201CIt\u2019s people like you that are stifling the Minmatar
    race. It\u2019s your narrow-mindedness that\u2019s keeping billions of our people
    enslaved and oppressed this very minute!\u201D Karin was fed up and stormed away,
    furious.\n\nThinking about all of this now, sitting here in the murky tent with
    Mattmar and his friends nearby, made Karin regret having said those things to
    him. Not that she was ashamed of her beliefs, but she shouldn\u2019t have blurted
    them out like that, Mattmar was just the type to misunderstand the whole thing.
    She also regretted loosing her temper, it didn\u2019t improve her views in Mattmar\u2019s
    eyes. Hopefully he would forget the whole thing.\n\nKarin was pulled from her
    reverie by Vormar\u2019s voice. He was gathering the adolescents around him, in
    preparation for the guidance he was going to give them in his role as essence
    instructor. Once they were seated around him, he began.\n\n\u201CWell, this is
    our last discussion before the ceremony begins. We\u2019ve already covered pretty
    much everything and I think you\u2019re all ready for the test. Just remember
    to stay calm during the ceremony and keep your mind focused. We have a last minute
    arrival here, Eliza. She\u2019s been space cruising with her family for the last
    few weeks and they just arrived in time for the ceremony. So if the rest of you
    don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll give Eliza a quick review. The rest of you can stay
    if you want to.\u201D\n\nNo one moved, Vormar\u2019s presence helped them to relax,
    something they all needed at this time. Vormar continued:\n\n\u201CEliza, maybe
    it\u2019s best if you ask me about anything that\u2019s on your mind.\u201D\n\n\u201CSo,
    how exactly does the mark appear as it does?\u201D It came as no surprise that
    Eliza, obviously a keen and bright girl, immediately asked about the most troubling
    matter on the minds of those undergoing the test.\n\nVormar cleared his throat
    before replying: \u201CYes, thank you Eliza for coming right to the point. As
    you know, if you\u2019ve witnessed a Voluval before, those being tested undergo
    a special treatment by the spirit conductor overseeing the ceremony. This treatment
    involves direct injections into the heart and the ventral root area\u2026\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat
    kind of injections?\u201D Eliza interrupted.\n\n\u201CWell, a large quantity of
    tyrosine is injected into the heart, which then, through metabolism, is turned
    into melanin by the body. Frankly, I\u2019m not sure what exactly the mixture
    injected into the ventral root area consists off; it\u2019s a closely guarded
    secret of the chemists that prepare it. Only a few of the ingredients are commonly
    known, among them are acetylcholine, oxytocin, calcitonin, and vasoactive intestinal
    polypeptide.\u201D The names were clearly just as unfamiliar to Vormar as the
    rest of them, but at least it was something.\n\n\u201CAnd what does it do?\u201D
    Eliza probed further. Vormar didn\u2019t seem annoyed by Eliza\u2019s discourteous
    questions; he was probably used to all kinds of weird or silly or rude questions
    from those he was preparing for the Voluval.\n\n\u201CMagic!\u201D Vormar said
    and smiled. \u201CNo, seriously speaking, I can\u2019t tell you with certainty.
    The melanin spreads all over the body through the blood stream, but only the small
    bit that is affected by the other injection is actually used. The rest flushes
    out of the body. Now, the real mystery is what the ventral root injection does.
    We only know what little the chemists that prepare it tell us: that it connects
    with the sub-consciousness and then uses the free-flowing melanin to form intricate
    marks on the body. These marks become a permanent feature of the person\u2019s
    skin, a permanent tan so to speak that alters according to the skin color of the
    person to be constantly visible. They describe that person\u2019s inner-self;
    what kind of person he is deep down. I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s all I know, and
    I guess you\u2019ve heard it many times before.\u201D\n\nEliza continued to ask
    Vormar about the effects and nature of the injection, but Karin ignored them,
    she\u2019d heard it all before. It was obvious to her that Vormar knew nothing
    more, or at least was unwilling to reveal it.\n\nLike most Minmatar men Vormar
    was bare from the waist up, only thus could the multiple tattoos be displayed
    and appreciated properly. She scrutinized Vormar\u2019s mark: a circled dot just
    above his navel.\n\nSinuous tattoos coiled around it, but none covered it. It
    was forbidden to put a tattoo over ones mark. Karin wished her mark would appear
    on the abdomen like Vormar\u2019s. It was humiliating to get it on the legs or
    arms or even the back. Karin knew that many dreamed about getting their mark in
    the face; it was the ultimate honor and brought instant fame to anyone that acquired
    it. But only one in a million got a facial mark, and the social burden of getting
    one was something that Karin was certain she could never handle at her age.\n\nOnce
    the session was over Karin joined a group of buddies from school. She couldn\u2019t
    really call any of them a friend; being the only slave-child in the school she
    was an outsider to most of the others.\n\nThe group was chatting about idle things,
    school and the weather; none of them wanted to think too much about the ceremony
    that was to start in a couple of hours. Not that the ceremony itself was that
    terrible, but the results of the ceremony could permanently alter the lives of
    any of them. Suddenly Mattmar barged into the group along with his loud and boisterous
    friends.\n\n\u201CWhy\u2019s everyone so gloomy?\u201D He cried. \u201CWe\u2019re
    getting our ticket into adulthood in a few hours and you act like a bunch of scared
    sissies. C\u2019mon you guys, brighten up. We\u2019ll party through the night
    and tomorrow we go and get ourselves our first tattoos.\u201D Mattmar finished
    with a flourish. All the kids around him cheered. But like the night before, Karin
    felt that Mattmar\u2019s attitude was immature, even if it lightened the crowd.
    He was too superficial about the whole thing, like it was some kind of a game.
    Mattmar spotted her sour face and called out:\n\n\u201CHey Karin, what\u2019s
    up? Afraid you won\u2019t get your martyr mark?\u201D He then turned to the others
    and continued:\n\n\u201CKarin wants to become friends with the Ammatars, she wants
    to go on a crusade with them.\u201D All the kids laughed and jeered at Karin.\n\n\u2018The
    bastard.\u2019 She thought, fighting the tears. \u2018How could he?\u2019 Karin
    finally realized what kind of a person Mattmar was. To him friendship meant nothing.
    He only called someone a friend when it suited his own selfish purposes. \u2018How
    could I be so stupid to trust him?\u2019 She thought. The taunts continued, the
    kids began calling her names:\n\n\u201CStupid Ammatar bitch\u2026\u201D\n\n\u201CFilthy
    slave-lover\u2026\u201D\n\n\u201CYour mother was raped by an Amarr Holder, you
    ugly bastard\u2026\u201D\n\nKarin ran away, the taunts following her retreating
    steps, silent tears streaming down her cheeks. She knew her dream was to most
    people absurd, but she fervently believed in it, and she wasn\u2019t going to
    give it up for anybody. \u2018Maybe I\u2019m like the Rock in the story.\u2019
    She thought to herself. \u2018Maybe I want to build my own mountain, pebble for
    pebble, stone for stone. And cripple myself when it crumbles.\u2019\n\nThe sacred
    ground was a flat piece of land about quarter of a kilometer on each side. It
    formed a small stage-like plateau of crystallized rock, formed by the extreme
    heat caused by the thrusters of a landing space ship.\n\nThe sacred ground marked
    the place where one of the huge colonization ships carrying the ancestors of the
    Minmatars landed thousands of years ago.\n\nA circle of fires enclosed the plateau,
    the flickering lights illuminating the place and blocking out the stars. Spectators
    numbering a few thousands thronged the area around it, but the plateau itself
    was empty. In the middle of it, circles and signs had been painted in preparation
    for the upcoming ritual.\n\nThe ceremony was about to start. The spirit conductor
    entered the plateau; his appearance silenced the expectant crowd. Behind the spirit
    conductor the lesser supervisors filed along, each taking their places on the
    plateau. Music, rhythmical beatings, sprang forth; the men on the plateau began
    humming a hymn in time to the music; the Voluval had started.\n\nOn a stony hillock
    some two kilometers from the sacred ground a lonesome figure huddled on a rock.
    Karin watched the ceremony commence, uncertainty written over her face. She wanted
    to crawl under the rock she sat on, crawl beneath it and disappear forever. But
    she couldn\u2019t do it, she owed it to the parents she never knew to go back
    and take the test. She kicked a small pebble at her feet and watched it roll down
    the hillside, taking dozens of its brethren with it. She made up her mind. If
    she couldn\u2019t face her fears here, among supposed friends and allies, then
    when could she? If she wasn\u2019t ready to stand up for her beliefs against her
    compatriots, then how could she do so when facing Ammatars, or Amarrians? Karin
    stood up and started running.\n\nThe first few participants were through. All
    had escaped humiliation and many were proudly brandishing respectable marks. Karin
    joined the back of the line, ignoring the curious gazes around her. Next up was
    Mattmar.\n\nHe strode to the spirit conductor, confidence radiating from him.
    He kneeled before the conductor, who sprinkled Mattmar\u2019s head with a smelly
    brew intended to cleanse the spirit. Then Mattmar raised his head and one of the
    assistants handed the conductor a silver syringe. With one swift stroke the conductor
    plunged the syringe right into Mattmar\u2019s chest, through his breastbone and
    into his heart. Mattmar\u2019s body tensed, but he didn\u2019t cry out, as so
    many did. The conductor pulled the syringe out again in another practiced stroke
    and the assistant pressed a cloth against the small puncture wound on Mattmar\u2019s
    chest.\n\nThe conductor continued his ritual mumblings, walking behind Mattmar.
    Kneeling behind the boy he took another syringe from the hands of an assistant.
    With his left hand he felt Mattmar\u2019s small back for a second before plunging
    the syringe into the base of the spine. Again Mattmar tensed, but there was no
    cry.\n\nThe conductor rose to his feet and walked in front of Mattmar again. Now
    it was Mattmar\u2019s turn to speak, the only time during the ritual he was allowed
    to. A small saying was required, while the potions started racing through the
    body. The saying was intended as a declaration of the person\u2019s look on life,
    himself, or his surroundings. Through the ages, many of the sayings became standardized,
    children saying the same thing as their mother or father before them. Karin had
    thought long and hard about her saying, finally deciding on two lines from a poem
    by Hantur Gutreren: \u2018Place yourself in the heart of your family/Then nothing
    can separate you\u2019, finding it appropriate for her background and future dreams.
    Mattmar didn\u2019t say anything new, his saying was the same as his father\u2019s:
    \u2018I take pride in protecting my people and honor in housing them.\u2019\n\nMattmar
    rose to his feet and the conductor placed a black mantle around his head and shoulders,
    covering him completely. It would be removed once the mark had appeared. Everyone
    waited in anticipation; the minutes ticked by. Finally the conductor declared
    that the mark had appeared and removed the mantle. Mattmar looked down, then turned
    towards the crowd. The bull-mark, the horned triangle, was sitting squarely in
    the middle of his chest. It was the ultimate place for such a mark. Mattmar beamed
    with pride when the crowd enthusiastically applauded. He took his place on the
    plateau among those already tested, his haughty manners disgusting Karin.\n\nThe
    ceremony continued, one adolescent after another. Karin didn\u2019t pay much attention
    to the procedure. Between her nervousness and the arrogant glare of Mattmar in
    her direction her mind didn\u2019t seem to function all too well. At last it was
    her turn. She walked up to the conductor, trying not to shake visibly. She went
    through the motions of the ceremony like an automaton, not even noticing whether
    she cried or not when the steel syringe penetrated her flesh. The conductor\u2019s
    voice broke through to her; it was time for her saying. She opened her eyes. Over
    the shoulder of the conductor she saw the toothy grin on Mattmar\u2019s face.
    Karin opened her mouth and listened to the words spill out: \u2018Vain flame burns
    fast/and its lick is light/Modest flame lasts long/and burns to the bone.\u2019
    Karin didn\u2019t realize what she said until it was all out; she was as startled
    as the others. She saw Mattmar\u2019s smile falter a little. He knew what she
    meant.\n\nKarin felt the tingle, in her spine and under her skin. She wasn\u2019t
    sure if it felt discomforting or merely unpleasant. The conductor placed the mantle
    on her shoulders and lifted the hood over her head, shielding her eyes from those
    around her. Her mind was a blur, but from its depth she heard Vormar\u2019s voice:
    \u2018Keep your mind focused.\u2019 She forced her mind clear, her skin now felt
    cold and clammy, then suddenly the mantle was pulled off her. She blinked once
    or twice, accustoming her eyes once more to the bright lights illuminating the
    small plateau. She looked around her. Every face was staring at her like she had
    suddenly materialized from thin air. Silence, none spoke, all she heard was her
    own shallow breathing. The decade old memory of the boy and his pale-eye mark
    popped into her mind; the reaction then was the same stunned silence. Karin looked
    down on herself. Nothing, she saw nothing on her torso or abdomen or legs or arms.
    Then the conductor lifted a mirror and she saw her face. And there, extending
    down and side-ways from her left eye were several dark lines, ranging from one
    to three centimeters in length. She caught her breath. It was the Ray of Matar
    mark, the rarest and most revered of all the marks.\n\nKarin felt dizzy, like
    she was going to faint; her mind was in turmoil. And yet her face, staring at
    her in the mirror, remained impassive and calm. She looked the conductor in the
    eye; the man was obviously in a state of shock and disbelief. As Karin was the
    last of those undergoing the test the conductor should be finishing off the ceremony
    at this very moment, but he stood there immobile. She scanned the faces of the
    crowd, finally finding a familiar face in Vormar. The pleading in her eyes was
    not unnoticed by the old man and he walked to her. Vormar took her hands in his
    and softly said:\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re obviously meant for something great, my
    dear.\u201D\n\n\u201CYes.\u201D Karin answered confidently. \u201CYes, I\u2019m
    sure I am.\u201D\n\nIn her mind, the stones were beginning to pile up, one by
    one."
