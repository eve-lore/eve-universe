    tall man moved slowly through the packed transit hall. His gaunt, eagle-nosed
    face registered total lack of interest in his surroundings, like he had seen the
    same or similar ones a thousand times in the past. His garments, cheap and somber,
    were identical to those worn by millions of migration workers, constantly on the
    move from one station to another in search of work. A small satchel was slung
    over his shoulder, seemingly holding the man\u2019s only possessions. At the back
    of his bare skull a crab-like cyber-ornament clung, its azure colored arms extending
    all the way to his temples.\n\nThe large transit hall was an irregularly shaped
    circle, with a glass dome overhead. The transit hall had been strategically positioned
    so that people arriving or leaving the station could gaze through the dome at
    the reddish planet below and the pale sun in the background. But like with so
    many small industrial stations in the empire\u2019s interior the almost total
    lack of maintenance had long since ruined the spectacular view, a greasy-brown
    film of dirt giving those below in the hall only a vague idea of the vista outside.
    The walls were covered with a once-colorful mural depicting an often-used theme
    in Amarrian wall paintings \u2013 scenes of the Emperor performing assorted heroic
    deeds. Here and there the mural was severed by an entryway to one of the dozen
    passages leading to and from the transit hall.\n\nThe large man headed towards
    the passage leading to the lower levels of the station. For a fraction of a second
    his darting eyes looked directly into the security camera located above the entryway.
    Then he disappeared down the passage, his face as impassive as when he stepped
    out of the shuttle fifteen minutes earlier.\n\nThe small room was illuminated
    solely by a two dozen monitors mounted into the back wall. Before them sat a tired
    looking officer, his heavy eyes scanning the screens before him. The picture on
    a screen in the middle had been frozen; a gaunt face with a patriarch nose filled
    the screen. In the far corner of the room a figure stood leaning on a cane, the
    glare of the monitors only managing to paint it in a ghost-like blue silhouette.\n\n\u201CHe\u2019s
    here, sir. He\u2019s heading towards the lower levels.\u201D The officer said.
    \u201CDo you wish me to have him apprehended?\u201D\n\n\u201CNo need for that
    yet.\u201D The shadowy figure answered. \u201CWe\u2019ll allow the fox to flush
    out some hens before moving in.\u201D\n\nEtian pressed his back into the corridor\u2019s
    wall, his head bowed to his chest as the process of Holders passed him by.Leading
    the process was the governor himself, his fine linen cloths embroidered with gold
    threads and platinum pearls. Out of the corner of his eyes Etian watched the others
    lined up against the wall, commoners like himself, stealing furtive glances at
    the majestic process as it passed. On some faces Etian could read envy or awe
    or odium, but each one also registered fear. For those men passing them were the
    most powerful men on Inis-Ilix station and each and every one of them had the
    power and the authority to dictate the destiny of any of these commoners that
    lined the walls in apparent reverence.\n\nOnce the Holders had disappeared round
    a corner Etian straightened his small but stocky body and continued on his way
    to the St. Helion Social Club, his favorite after-work retreat. As he walked he
    wondered what the Holders were doing down here on the lower levels, they seldom
    visited the levels of the commoners. The fact that the Holders had been traveling
    without any personal guards didn\u2019t come as a surprise to Etian; to the common
    Amarrian a Holder symbolized the grandeur of the Amarr Empire and to attack one
    was to attack the Empire itself. Such an act was unthinkable to the common Amarr
    man; the Empire, with its age-old traditions and structure, was the foundation
    of society itself. To every Amarrian life without the Empire was nothing but anarchy,
    chaos, dread and darkness.\n\nEtian belonged to a group of skilled workers that
    traveled from one station to another in the Trigentia sector, offering their services
    to factories and foundries on the space stations. This custom, which is found
    almost nowhere else within the vast Amarr Empire, started several centuries ago
    when the sector was recently settled. At that time numerous minor Holders vied
    for power, each with his own ideas on how to run things. This resulted in a complex
    tapestry of rules and regulations regarding for instance education, travel permits
    and freedom of employment. With time this resulted in great economical diversity
    between the stations in the area, some prospered while others stagnated. When
    the emperor re-organized the administration in the sector a sole Holder was chosen
    to govern it as a whole, with governors on each station working under him. Soon
    thereafter the first migration workers appeared \u2013 people with some specific
    skills that only a handful of the stations could train and produce. This system
    worked well in the economical sense \u2013 the sector was prosperous and was fast
    becoming one of the most important industrial zones in the Amarr Empire. But this
    prosperity came at a price; the migration workers were better informed and enjoyed
    more liberties than other workers, let alone the slaves. They gobbled up dangerous
    ideas regarding their rights and stature, resulting in demonstrations and protests,
    sometimes violent. The Holders were facing a dilemma; they were anxious to keep
    social stirrings to the minimum, but were unsure how to accomplish this without
    breaking their golden eggs \u2013 the migration workers. While the Holders were
    searching for ways to keep things getting out of hand the migration workers were
    clamoring ever louder for greater rights and higher wages \u2013 on many stations
    in the Trigentia sector tension was rising to the boiling point. On many there
    had been bloody fights, sometimes resulting in the total expulsion of migration
    workers or severe restriction on their privileges. But there was one fabled one
    where the workers had succeeded...\n\nTo Etian this development was making him
    deeply anxious. Born into a strictly orthodox family and raised to respect the
    social order no matter what, these stirrings by his fellow workers seemed almost
    treasonous, even sacrilegious. Yet, Etian had to admit that this fight for increased
    rights seemed reasonable enough. His mind was torn between his duty to the state
    and loyalty to his co-workers; the responsibilities of his public life against
    the comfort of his private one; all these things sat heavily on Etian\u2019s mind
    as he made his way towards the club.\n\nInis-Ilix station had seen its share of
    unrest in recent months, only the week before two migration workers had been imprisoned
    for \u2018disturbing the peace\u2019, as the official statement read. Etian knew
    of several small cells operating, but they didn\u2019t amount to much \u2013 only
    a handful of the migration workers had truly succumbed to the fervor of power
    politics, most, like Etian, were doubtful. In their view this whole turbulence
    could be blamed on those impulsive fools on Turba.\n\nSt. Helion Social Club was
    opened some 30 years earlier by a religious order with the purpose of spreading
    the word of St. Helion the Virtuous among the lower classes. The order was at
    that time under the patronage of Lady Temal Kador, one of the Five Heirs, and
    through her influence the order opened vast number of similar clubs all over Kador\u2019s
    domains. But a few years later the order fell out of favor with the Heir and their
    clubs were sold. In the three decades of operation the club had slowly degenerated
    from a respectable, if boring, religious establishment into a grubby workers bar.
    The club was not big, one room crudely split in the middle by a bar. The interior
    was still covered with religious symbols and signs but St. Helion\u2019s order
    had long since left and the word of God had been replaced by the drunken drivel
    of the workers frequenting the place.\n\nEtian took his usual seat in a back corner,
    scanning the familiar faces on the tables around him. He nurtured his drink for
    a few minutes in silence until a friend and a co-worker of his, Ryed Gambala,
    moved over to Etian\u2019s table. Most of the people in the room were migration
    workers like the two of them and many of them were fellow employees at RPI. Yet
    they were grouped in pairs or at most three at a table, occasionally a person
    moved from one table to another, this always spurred a person on that table to
    move on too. The station authorities had banned migration workers from grouping
    together \u2013 a group of more than 2 or 3 people together made the authorities
    extremely paranoid. So even while relaxing in a bar the migration workers took
    the precaution to give the impression of separation, in case of lurking informers
    or camera drones.\n\n\u201CSo, Etian.\u201D Ryed said, half-whispering, glancing
    furtively around the bar before continuing: \u201CWill you be coming?\u201D Etian
    sighed, seeing where this conversation was leading. Ryed was in one of these newly
    formed cells that dreamt of the success their brethren at Turba had got.\n\n\u201CLook,
    Ryed, I don\u2019t think a public protest will get you anything but trouble. I
    mean, how many are you? Maybe a dozen. That\u2019s hardly a sufficient number
    to shake the foundations of this station\u2019s government. From what I hear,
    the Turba protesters numbered at least a few hundred. It\u2019s a doomed prospect,
    man.\u201D Etian said, exasperated. This wasn\u2019t the first time that Ryed
    brought this up, but each time Etian had turned him down. Much as he wanted to
    see some changes, Etian was much too clever and cautious to take part in any risky
    demonstration like the one Ryed\u2019s cell was planning.\n\n\u201CWhere\u2019s
    there will there\u2019s a way. We may be few, but we\u2019re dedicated to the
    cause. Come on, it\u2019s now or never.\u201D Ryed continued chanting his slogans
    like in a religious fervor. It was clear to Etian that Ryed had become fanatical
    about this whole business: he was obviously never going to change his mind and,
    more exasperatingly, never going to change the subject. Etian began looking for
    an excuse to bring the conversation to an end, when he saw her.\n\nShe walked
    into the bar with a light spring in her step that spoke of perfect body control
    and self-assurance. Etian only knew her first name: Deka. Like him she frequented
    the club, but apart from her name he knew nothing about her; this perceived mystique
    only made Etian all the more infatuated with her. Watching her from afar Etian\u2019s
    ample imagination had time and again played out one dramatic scenario after another
    where he was the hero in white and she the damsel in distress. Afterwards Etian
    always felt sick of himself; of the way he dawdled over his daydreams constantly,
    never having the courage to act any of them out in real life. And this time it
    was no different. While Ryed droned on in the background Etian once again let
    his mind slip into the comforting mode of daydreaming. The more he dreamt the
    more he drank and the more depressed he felt.\n\nStaggering home some two hours
    later he wondered for the umpteenth time if he\u2019d ever be man enough to go
    talk to her.\n\nThe factory of the Royal Precision Instruments, known as RPI,
    was situated on the lowest deck, like most of the factories on the station. Most
    of the year the permanent workers made micro-optics and fiber-conduits, but during
    the months of Domar and Nemar the workforce of RPI tripled as migration workers
    came in to make quantum clocks, using the volatile argon isotopes laboriously
    mined in a nearby asteroid field. In those two months the migration workers used
    up all the factory\u2019s supplies of the substance, which then took the company
    a whole year to restock.\n\nThe month of Domar was coming to an end. Etian, working
    through his hangover and cursing himself for drinking so excessively the night
    before, let his mind wander while performing his tedious work on the clock\u2019s
    escapement. It seemed to him like the whole RPI was seething, that his fellow
    migration workers were like a dormant volcano only waiting to erupt. Etian knew
    he was caught up in one of the rarest of social phenomenons in the Amarr Empire;
    that of social uprising. Somehow this privilege didn\u2019t comfort him all that
    much. Overhearing snippets of conversations around him Etian learned that a big
    gathering was planned for tonight at St. Helion\u2019s Social Club. Etian decided
    to go, he couldn\u2019t tell why. Maybe it was out of curiosity, maybe to show
    solidarity, or maybe just to get yet another glimpse of her, Deka.\n\nWhen Etian
    entered the social club it was already teeming with people. His usual table at
    the back was already occupied by loud-mouthed men in overalls, so he sat at a
    table closer to the center. A man was already sitting there, hunched with a cape
    hiding his features. There was no sign of Deka.\n\n\u201CAre you here for the
    demonstration?\u201D The stranger asked, a pair of pale-blue eyes peering at him
    from under the hood of his cape. Etian felt strangely naked in front of that stare.
    Looking into those eyes set his head spinning and it took seconds before the question
    registered in his mind.\n\n\u201CI, uh\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201D He finally
    stammered. The stranger seemed a bit annoyed by his answer and Etian felt strangely
    compelled to please this man he\u2019d never seen before.\n\n\u201CI came here
    to give my support to the cause.\u201D Etian said more forcefully, hoping that
    this vague answer would satisfy the man sitting opposite him without sounding
    as a commitment to do something foolish. The stranger stared at him for a few
    moments before speaking:\n\n\u201CI\u2019m Fradis Ludono.\u201D He declared, staring
    intently at Etian as if to gauge his reaction. Again it took Etian a moment to
    get his mind around what the man had said. Then the name registered and Etian
    jumped. Fradis Ludono. The man from Turba. The man who led Turba\u2019s migration
    workers to a victory against the station\u2019s rulers. The man who faced down
    the Holders of Turba and won for the workers a freedom to work and life as they
    chose. The man was a living legend, traveling from station to station to preach
    the word and support the people.\n\nFor several seconds the two men stared each
    other in the eye. Finally Etian managed to get his mind into gear:\n\n\u201CI\u2019m
    Etian Subidam.\u201D He said and extended his hand. Fradis gripped it firmly.
    Then he spoke:\n\n\u201CEtian Subidam, will you help me help you? Will you aid
    me in securing for you freedom from the tyrants of Inis-Ilix station?\u201D\n\n\u201CI
    guess I do.\u201D Etian stammered. At that moment he noticed Deka sitting by the
    bar and suddenly Etian had flash of insight. His biggest weakness was his lack
    of self-confidence and what better way to alter that than to rub shoulders with
    none other than Fradis Ludono. If anything was going to work in bringing Etian
    some self-esteem this was it. And heck, with Fradis here this demonstration might
    not be as dicey as before.\n\n\u201CI will help you.\u201D He said with fervor,
    the conviction clearly evident in his voice. Fradis seemed satisfied.\n\n\u201CGood.\u201D
    He said. \u201CI haven\u2019t been here for long, but we must act as quickly as
    possible. If the authorities discover I\u2019m here before we\u2019re ready things
    could turn bad. From what I\u2019ve heard there are already some cells operating
    in this area, so preparations should be easy.\u201D\n\n\u201CIt is true that there
    are a number of cells around.\u201D Etian said. \u201CBut they don\u2019t hold
    much sway. I\u2019m afraid that most of the workers are a bit skeptical about
    this whole thing.\u201D He finished almost apologetically, aware that not so long
    ago he had been one of those skeptics. Fradis didn\u2019t seem at all daunted
    by this news.\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s because they haven\u2019t heard the word yet.\u201D
    He said with confidence. \u201CWe will show them what it means to be a real man.\u201D
    With that Fradis removed his cape, revealing his bald head with its intricate
    implant at the back of the skull. If Etian had ever been in doubt if the man really
    was who he said he was that doubt was totally expelled now \u2013 the image of
    Fradis Ludono was almost as well known in these quarters as the portrait of the
    emperor himself. No sooner had Fradis removed his cape than people began pointing
    and whispering excitedly.\n\nFradis climbed onto the table and then stood there
    surveying the room calmly, scanning the faces of the excited but hushed workers
    thronging around him.\n\n\u201CFellow migration workers.\u201D He finally said,
    his sonorous voice carrying to the farthest corners of the room. \u201CYou all
    know me. And you know my background. So you shouldn\u2019t guess why I\u2019m
    here. In a way, I\u2019m answering your call, for many of you have already laid
    the foundation for our glorious victory over the tyrants of this station that
    is soon to come.\u201D The crowd was now hanging onto his every word.\n\n\u201CBut
    I know many of you also have doubts in your hearts.\u201D Fradis continued. \u201CYou
    doubt the righteousness of this deed. You doubt whether you are worthy of taking
    the power from those that took it from you so long ago. For you\u2019ve been conditioned
    from birth to respect and fear those men that claim to be better than you. I say:
    cast those shackles of you!\u201D Etian could see that Fradis was getting to the
    people, yet there were still those that were unconvinced. Etian suspected himself
    as being one of them. Fradis sensed this all, he knew from experience that more
    was needed to convince them, or at least to persuade them join the fray. He continued:\n\n\u201CThey
    have told you time and again that you\u2019re not capable of governing yourself,
    that you\u2019re too weak of mind. Their teachings have long since reached the
    core of your souls. I say: to free your soul you must forget those teachings.
    You must stop believing that you\u2019re incompetent to rule yourself and start
    believing that a free mind can accomplish anything it wants!\u201D Fradis was
    reaching a crescendo. The crowd was shouting encouragements, the majority already
    gleefully shouting their approval. Etian saw Ryed among them. To Etian the words
    Fradis spoke were much more radical than those he\u2019d heard previously and
    that frightened him. Ryed and his gang had only been advocating a demonstration
    for higher wages and more rights, but Fradis\u2019 words seemed to imply a complete
    overthrow of the government of the station. Yet Etian, for all his misgivings,
    couldn\u2019t help but be moved by the passion of Fradis and the excitement of
    the crowd.\n\nMaybe you don\u2019t believe me when I say that you\u2019re all
    conditioned.\u201D Fradis shouted to the frenzied crowd. \u201CBut let us all
    look at one example. Name me a poem that we all know, a poem that is taught to
    all children at an early age. A poem that supposedly shows that man should not
    try to usurp God but put their faith in him, but which in reality describes the
    way the upper classes trample on the ignorant commoners. Yes, you know what poem
    I\u2019m talking about. You all know it by heart. Why don\u2019t we recite it
    together so your eyes can be opened to just one of the cunning ways the Holders
    have put their shackles on your souls.\u201D And Fradis began chanting, many in
    the crowd joining in:\n\n\u2018I raised my head and saw this stair;\nA solid structure
    made of stone,\nReaching high into the air.\nI looked around, I stood alone.\nThis
    muddy field held no appeal;\nFull of care I neared the base;\nSure enough, the
    stair was real.\nWhat hidden dangers might I face\nClimbing up this endless stair?\nI
    knew not, nor ever could\nFor always gazed in unknown fear\nOf future bright or
    bleak or good;\n\u2018Tis matters not when control lack;\nThe fate of man in other\u2019s
    hands.\nBut then again this skybound track\nMight lead me to the promised lands.\u2019\n\n\u201CWhat
    does this first verse tell us?\u201D Fradis asked. He waited a second before continuing:
    \u201CIt tells us that we all have a desire to govern our own live, that this
    desire is ingrained in every one of us and that we dream of becoming our own masters.\u201D
    He then said, answering his own question. Then he continued:\n\n\u2018With eager
    heart and earnest face,\nI set out to seek this exulted place.\nAnd once I had
    the first flight won\nI felt as the climb was halfway done.\nSoon I learned to
    stride the stair\nWith ease and thus became aware\nOf my surroundings for the
    first time,\nAround me saw this view sublime.\nFresh air caressed my cheek and
    jowl,\nBelow me saw a friendly fowl.\nWith joy I climbed and noticed much;\nHappy
    games and wonders such.\nI knew this world belonged to me\nNow at last that I
    was free.\n\u2018Why, arts and music; life and joys;\nAnd let\u2019s make all
    those science toys.\u2019\n\n\u201CAnd here, like a glimpse into paradise, we\u2019re
    given a taste of what self-government might achieve.\u201D Fradis declared. \u201CBut
    dangers lurk, as the next verse tells us:\u201D\n\n\n\u2018Finally I felt my powers
    could\nChoose my fate as I saw fit;\nThis world I owned and understood,\nIt was
    made for my own benefit.\nWhen I slept I dreamt sweet dreams\nOf things to come
    I knew where true.\nOnce I\u2019d reach the top my schemes\nTo make this world
    all anew\nShould at last all bear fruit.\nBut this sound beneath my soles,\nRestless,
    endless, nagging, crude,\nRasped my soul and raped my goals.\nThe stair behind
    me slowly fell,\nErased forever with a tired sigh.\nEmpty steps with tales to
    tell\nRaced towards me in a silent cry.\u2019\n\n\u201CHere, we\u2019re told that
    our greed and our stupidity will always come back to haunt us. That only those
    better than us are capable of ruling wisely enough to keep us from destroying
    ourselves. And the last verse tells us the ultimate price our pride may have to
    pay if we don\u2019t stay in our place:\u201D\n\n\u2018Now I realized this frail
    old track\nChased me up with no way back.\nFaster, faster, I fled in dread;\nMy
    every effort spent, I sped\nUpwards, fearing death and drop,\nWhen suddenly I
    reached the top.\nBefore me stood this man in white.\nSlipping still, in dismay
    I cried:\n\u201COld man, help me on my feet!\u201D\n\u201CPoor victim of your
    filthy greed,\nLearn the humble way,\u201D he said.\nAnd spat and kicked me in
    the head.\nI fell and felt my mind go blank.\nI hit the ground, in mud I sank.\n\u2018Who
    am I and where is here?\u2019\nI raised my head and saw this stair.\u2019\n\n\u201CI
    say to you: is this the world we want to live in? Are we to accept that we\u2019re
    not good enough to govern our own lives?\u201D Fradis was whipping the crowd into
    a frenzy and Etian felt himself swept into this vortex of emotions and passions,
    shouting himself hoarse, for the first time feeling enraged and disgusted with
    the way the authorities had been playing him like a fool. \u2018No more!\u2019
    echoed through his mind and his thoughts were being shouted throughout the room.
    Fradis raised his hands, waiting for the room to calm down before giving his final
    verdict, in almost total silence:\n\n\u201CI say, my brothers and sisters: they
    may govern the way we live, but we can still govern the way we die and if there
    is any cause worth dying for, then this is it. I have put myself at risk a thousand
    times for this cause; I have faced death a hundred times; and I\u2019ve come here
    tonight to tell you that I will continue to do so until a day will come when we
    can live our lives as we please with no-one trying to oppress us or kill us.\u201D
    Etian was sold, as was the whole room. If Fradis had ordered it Etian was sure
    that the whole crowd would march to the upper levels this very minute to die by
    his side. But Fradis ordered no such thing. Instead he said:\n\n\u201CThis is
    only the first step. We must now prepare ourselves, but we must move quickly before
    suspicion arises.\u201D He stepped down from the table and was immediately surrounded
    by people asking him questions or simply touching him in awe. Suddenly Etian noticed
    that Deka had slipped beside him.\n\n\u201CI saw you talking to him earlier.\u201D
    She said quietly, keeping her eyes on the man in question.\n\n\u201CYou noticed
    that?\u201D Was all Etian could utter.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ve also noticed you staring
    at me in the past.\u201D She said amusingly.\n\n\u201CAh\u2026\u201D Etian felt
    himself blush.\n\n\u201CWhat did you two talk about?\u201D Deka asked, looking
    at Etian for the first time. He had to muster all his willpower to refrain from
    shuffling his feet. She was so forward!\n\n\u201CWe talked about the upcoming
    demonstration.\u201D He finally answered.\n\n\u201CReally? Are you planning it
    with him?\u201D She probed.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m helping him out.\u201D Etian said
    evasively. By now they had moved over to a nearby table and sat down. Etian was
    cursing himself for lying to her. \u2018But I didn\u2019t exactly lie,\u2019 he
    thought. \u2018I only omitted some of the truth,\u2019 he then justified. But
    he also knew that only through his supposed association with Ludono did he have
    enough self-confidence to stay there talking casually with the woman of his dreams.
    \u2018I\u2019m now eternally committed to this demonstration,\u2019 he reflected
    gloomily. \u2018Or should I say revolt? That seems to more to the mark.\u2019\n\nFradis
    dispersed the crowd a little later, wisely remarking that such a large gathering
    was bound to draw notice sooner or later. Etian tried not to look too crestfallen
    when Deka left, at least he had her promise to meet again to sustain him. Etian
    was just about to dive into some heavy drinking to sooth his nerves when Fradis
    laid his hand on his shoulder.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019ve got some planning to do.\u201D
    He said. Etian saw Ryed standing behind Fradis, grinning like a maniac in the
    company of some of his mates. \u2018Sink or swim,\u2019 Etian thought, joining
    his fellow conspirators into a back room.\n\nThe spacious office overlooked a
    pleasant little garden, a rare sight on any space station. The man leaned on his
    cane, looking out over his garden of retreat. Behind him stood a small man clad
    in a blue and black security uniform.\n\n\u201CHas he made contact yet?\u201D
    The man with the cane asked.\n\n\u201CYes, sir.\u201D The small man replied. \u201CLast
    night in\u2026\u201D he glanced at his notes. \u201CSt. Helion\u2019s Social Club.\u201D\n\n\u201CGood,
    good. Keep a tab on things. He should move soon, if I\u2019m not mistaken.\u201D\n\n\u201CYes,
    sir. Is that all, sir?\u201D\n\n\u201CFor now, just remember to clear out Hangar
    8.\u201D\n\n\u201CYes, sir.\u201D\n\nThe old furnace could still be turned up
    for heat, making the small alcove cozy and warm. Etian lay on the divan going
    over the events of the last couple of days in his mind. He was certain that nothing
    he had experienced before came close. Not only was he in the midst of some sinister
    plot to uproot the\n\ngovernment, but here, on this very divan, lay the woman
    of his dreams snuggled up against him sleeping soundly.\n\nShe had told him her
    life story, more or less. Her ancestors were of the lowest class of the commoners,
    just above slaves. Her large family was still eking their living out as the poorest
    of the poor. But she had managed to get out, quite an accomplishment by the standards
    of the empire. But he hadn\u2019t managed to get her to tell him what she did
    for a living.\n\nAnd now the woman in question was stirring in his arms, slowly
    returning to the waking world.\n\n\u201CGood morning.\u201D Etian said cheerfully.
    Deka yawned, bleary eyed.\n\n\u201CMornin\u2019\u201D She muttered, rubbing her
    eyes. Etian suddenly felt the urge to probe deeper into her life:\n\n\u201CSay,
    why don\u2019t you have to worry about going to your job? I know you didn\u2019t
    go yesterday and you don\u2019t seem to worried for today?\u201D He inquired,
    hoping to get a glimpse into what she did for a living. Deka only muttered something
    under her breath.\n\n\u201CYour not unemployed are you?\u201D Etian asked teasingly.\n\n\u201CCertainly
    not!\u201D She snapped, sitting bolt uprights. \u201CIf I didn\u2019t have a job
    I would be forced to go back to my family, I\u2019d rather die.\u201D She said
    with a feeling. Etian was a bit taken a back by her outburst, frightful that it
    might affect their budding relationship.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry, it just looked
    to me like you didn\u2019t mind your job too well.\u201D He said apologetically.\n\n\u201CI
    mind it very well, thank you.\u201D Deka said, still irritable. \u201CMy job and
    my status means everything to me.\u201D\n\n\u201CSo you\u2019d do anything to
    keep your job?\u201D Etian asked, racking his brain for what this job of hers
    might be.\n\n\u201COf course, it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.\u201D Deka replied.
    Etian was a little hurt by this remark, but kept quiet. He rose from the divan
    ensconced between the furnace and the wall and started dressing.\n\n\u201CWhy
    do we have to meet here instead of your apartment?\u201D Deka asked.\n\n\u201CBecause
    my apartment is maybe being watched. Fradis pointed that out to me. This is safer.
    No-one but you and me know about this place. Nobody comes down here anymore after
    the new reactor was opened. We\u2019re secure here. I\u2019ve even stocked this
    place full with food, we could hide here for ages.\u201D Etian answered, pulling
    on his boots. \u201CCome on, we\u2019ve got a big day ahead of us.\u201D He said
    eagerly, throwing Deka\u2019s cloths to her.\n\nThe demonstrators came trickling
    into the back-alley storage area. Etian had left Deka at the entrance earlier
    \u2013 they planned to meet after the demonstration, although both of them knew
    that things were likely to change dramatically in the next few hours, making any
    such plans hollow. Etian looked around him, the demonstrators were close to one
    hundred \u2013 young and eager. Most of them male; most only in their early twenties.
    As could be expected trepidation and uncertainty battled with anticipation and
    exhilaration on their faces as they unfurled their banners and hid their long
    knives in their jackets. At last Fradis stepped up and made his last speech before
    they\u2019d march.\n\n\u201CRemember our aim, people. We will march to level 2
    where the governor\u2019s quarters are and demand our rightful share in the government
    of this station. We will not resort to violence unless absolutely necessary \u2013
    we can talk to the guards, they will understand our cause and maybe join us. If
    things get tough you will follow your group leaders to the designated rally point,
    where we will re-group and re-organize. Now lets move!\u201D\n\nThe march had
    been carefully stage-managed, the mob was grouped into small groups of 10 people,
    with one person responsible for their movements and coordination. Etian was one
    of the group leaders, his group was the third from the last. Fradis marched with
    the last group, egging people on. As soon as the demonstrators were out on the
    street they started waiving their banners and chanting their slogans:\n\n\u201CPower
    to the People!\u201D\n\n\u201CDown with Tyranny!\u201D\n\n\u201COut with the Old,
    In with the New!\u201D\n\nThe procession slowly weaved its way towards the upper
    levels, in every street and at every corner they were met with astonished onlookers.
    Some shouted jeers or obscenities, other shouted encouragement and a few even
    joined in the march, swelling the number to well over hundred.\n\nThen they turned
    into the street leading up to the 4th level. It was empty. On they marched, their
    shouts echoing on the empty street, putting fright into some of them, their shouts
    growing fainter. At the end of the street they met a line of security guards blocking
    the street. The foremost groups happily marched towards them, expecting them to
    open up before them. Etian became apprehensive \u2013 he looked back and noticed
    that another group of heavily armed security guards were advancing up the street
    towards them. The front of the march now met the barricade of guards \u2013 they
    didn\u2019t budge. Tension was rising, some were fiddling with the sleeves on
    their jackets fingering their knives. Etian could easily see where this was heading.
    He sought out Fradis, but the tall man was nowhere visible. Others in the group
    were noticing the absence of their leader. Fear set in.\n\nWithin a few minutes
    the whole scene had boiled into a bloody battlefield. The guards from the lower
    level came charging into the back of the group, throwing it against the line of
    guards at the front. Knives flashed, stun-guns barked and electro-bats hummed.
    Blood flowed freely. Etian, trying to stay out of reach of the rushing security
    guards stumbled upon Ryed lying on the ground in a pool of blood; his face turning
    white and his eyes dim as the blood left his body. Etian cradled his head for
    a second, watching the last twinkle of life leave Ryed\u2019s eyes, before a guard
    charged into him and slammed him to the ground. Etian saw red.\n\nHalf an hour
    later Etian stumbled into the darkened interior of the St. Helion Social Club.
    His cloths were ripped, his hands were bloody and he had only a vague idea of
    how he got here. Sitting in a chair he tried to gather his thoughts in his head.
    He fetched a bottle from the bar and sat down again, gulping down a glass of alcohol.
    Everything was in shambles; the demonstration had been brutally brought down by
    the security forces, that much was clear. Etian fumbled in his pocket for the
    piece of paper that had sent his mind into a twirl when he took it from the dead
    fingers of a security officer he ran into. The paper, blood-smeared and torn,
    still clearly showed the route marked on the small station map, ending in a X.
    X marks the spot. Hangar 8. The rally point of the demonstration. Hangar 8. Where,
    according to this map, a bunch of security guards where patiently waiting for
    the few stragglers that had survived the carnage on the level 4 ramp.\n\nEtian
    saw it all clearly now \u2013 how he and his fellow migration workers had been
    set up by the crafty, charismatic Fradis Ludono. How they had been played like
    fools and then led to the slaughter like pigs. It all seemed so obvious now, in
    hindsight, always the worst of sights. Etian looked up, the image of his friend
    Ryed dying filling his vision. The memory of the silly yet affable Ryed welled
    up, before he caught the rebellious fervor, before all this\u2026 madness. Tears
    welled up in Etian\u2019s eyes. He brushed them away, his eyes focusing on a quotation
    from the Scriptures hanging on the wall opposite him, a relic of the Order of
    St. Helion:\n\nWhen the ears hear only,\nThe mouth shouting.\nAnd the eyes see
    only,\nThe fingers broken.\nThe world has turned,\nAnd God has gone.\nLeft us
    with fond memories,\nOf sweet life without pain.\n-- Apocalypse Verse 8:18\n\n\u2018How
    fitting this prophetical verse is.\u2019 Etian thought. \u2018Now all that is
    left is to hide. Hide forever.\u2019 And Etian got up and left the club for good.\n\nThe
    tinkle of the small water fountain was the only sound heard. The old man with
    the cane was sitting pleasantly on a bench, while a small security officer hovered
    nearby.\n\n\u201CAccording to the list provided by Ludono we\u2019ve got everyone
    except one, sir.\u201D The officer was saying. \u201CIf I may say so, sir, it
    was a masterly plan. The migration workers haven\u2019t shown as good a behavior
    as now for ages; they\u2019ve learnt their lesson.\u201D\n\n\u201CI can not take
    the credit for Fradis Ludono all by myself.\u201D The old man said, tap-tapping
    his cane on the pebbled ground. \u201CThis is a joint operation of all the security
    chiefs in the Trigentia-sector. The Turba set-up succeeded beautifully and the
    creation of this rebel leader Ludono was a masterstroke, I must say,\u201D the
    old man said with self-satisfaction. \u201CAnd the fact that we\u2019ve managed
    to keep it secret even from our own security forces. Even they think there\u2019s
    a dangerous rebel leader on the loose.\u201D The old man chuckled.\n\n\u201CWell,
    sir. Then everything seems to be in order. Except, there\u2019s still the question
    of this fellow Etian Subidam. We can\u2019t find him. Shall we intensify our search,
    sir?\u201D\n\n\u201CThere\u2019s no need for that. I\u2019ve already contacted
    a bounty hunter to find him and kill him.\u201D\n\n\u201CExcellent idea, sir.
    May I inquire who he is, sir?\u201D\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s a she actually. Goes by
    the name of Deka Nuros. Very reliable. Very efficient. She will tie up any loose
    ends no doubt, you know how I hate them.\u201D\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s excellent,
    sir.\u201D\n"
