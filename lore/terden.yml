    joined the Nation, he worked at an [old colony](7F4mXQ0x2Q4fCORw8MKm3W)

    under the man [Melvue](3lGS0xpEmMiYeWCooS7r4O), and appears to have lived

    with [Fermar''s](7cLMQC182YuCCSfazxcPbY) family. It''s unclear when Terden

    joined the Nation, but he appears to have been present at the old colony

    when Melvue sold it out.


    When he met Fermar at the [new colony](6cqzYEL9lVMn6APNJMCzvT), he was

    dressed in black, stylish in a fairly classical way and covered with a

    mop of dark, curly hair; noticeable, all in all, but not memorable. He

    was younger than Fermar by at least thirty years, but didn''t carry

    himself with the same bullish assurance. Fermar moved like a man used to

    high gravity; this one sidled like someone expecting the sky to pick him

    up at any time.


    As an advance scout, Terden''s job was often to approach colony managers

    like Fermar and ask them to cut a deal with the Nation to minimize

    casualties. Fermar shot and killed him before enacting his plan to

    destroy the Sansha raiding party in a trap.
