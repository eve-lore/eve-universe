- body: 'Sacred Flesh is an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) religious belief that

    [royal flesh](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) is sacred. It is an important

    doctrine of [the Scriptures](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp).


    Cloning restriction

    -------------------


    The most notable consequence of the doctrine is the restriction against

    the cloning of any member of a royal family; this includes the five

    Amarr Heirs and the [Amarr Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ). Royal

    flesh is considered sacred to the Amarr and thus

    [cloning](5y5CUyA9h4xXY40dInhn3o) a whole body is believed to make the

    sacred flesh impure. Because of this, the deaths of the heirs following

    the [Amarr Succession](1wt48mKlJG23uoZhpmxNzx) are permanent.


    Known violations of the restriction

    -----------------------------------


    Despite the importance of the doctrine, it has been violated more than

    once. [Keral](7bRDME40tMpJRpS2MtG1NC), a member of the

    [Ardishapur](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO) family, was cloned by his

    mother [Bethora](5wsvjWAtEn3fgbxYCq7eG3) after his death in a racing

    accident. In addition, [Jamyl I](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L) was cloned

    after her participation in the trials and later returned to become

    Empress. Though there was initial controversy surrounding her return, it

    died down in the months following her election as Empress, and it is now

    publicly claimed that her return was due to divine intervention.


    Exemptions for partial regrowth of flesh

    ----------------------------------------


    Significantly, it is only a full clone that is considered impure.

    Regrowing flesh from a living portion of the original is not considered

    a violation of the doctrine, as evidenced by the treatment of [Aritcio Kor-Azor](2puF18pxR6b7AVuy3HE9IV)
    at the hands of the [Speaker of Truths](3vA8Xh4A10DiybH2UTOEUO) [Brother Joshua](3GdUiafeRMQKdpzDb8CWnJ).
    Aritcio was brought to the brink of

    death, then revived and healed using a [cellular regenerator](4liwftCjzbWBQHTNJb5OXJ).
    Though his individual

    cells were cloned, the whole was still considered pure.
