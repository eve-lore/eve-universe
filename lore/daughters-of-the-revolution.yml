- body: 'The **Daughters of the Revolution** refers to girls born in the baby boom
    following the [Minmatar Rebellion](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp). On one planet, a group
    of revolutionaries grew into a violent mob before becoming even more tyrannical
    than the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) had been. After butchering and killing
    anyone who stood in their way they began to establish camps for forced labor,
    one kind for the men and another for the women. After they were killed, many babies
    were born who were mostly given away to foster families or to institutions.
