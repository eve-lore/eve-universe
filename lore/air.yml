    a sort of \"disruptor\" start-up in the tech industry. AIR was founded by two
    entrepreneurs who split from their respective corporations to create their own:
    Elida Balashirian, formerly of the [Sisters of EVE](2rrk92bQtToCN1naxS0OSc), and
    Daisuke Ojala, formerly of the Ishukone Corporation. Both left their respective
    corporations in good standing, and have used the connections they formed there
    to help kickstart AIR's research and development projects. Their former organizations
    have been tremendously helpful when it comes to sharing knowledge and resources
    (from data to ships) so long as AIR is as willing to share the fruits of their
    own labor.\n\nFocused heavily on research and development of new technologies
    across multiple industries, AIR is something of a jack of all trades organization.
    The company has subdivisions that cover everything from combat-oriented technology,
    industrial and economic endeavors, and exploration-focused pursuits. One of their
    current projects involves the study, refinement, and iteration of neural data
    transfer and cloning technologies.\n\nThe corporation has launched a new pilot
    program\u2013the [Capsuleer Training Program](7pnycXWiN9qUmgsnOG2UAr#air-capsuleer-training-program)\u2013that
    involves testing their newly developed proprietary neural data transfer and cloning
    tech on aspiring capsuleers as a part of the AIR Capsuleer Training Program."

- body: "## Corporate Philosophy\n\nAIR seeks to recruit the brightest minds from
    across the cluster, regardless of their Empire of origin. AIR is also not afraid
    to recruit people who may have fallen afoul of the legal systems of New Eden,
    claiming the importance of giving such people second chances. Some of their scientists
    and engineers have previously been either arrested or censured for violating the
    legal framework restricting their areas of expertise or for doing work considered
    unethical. Part of AIR's lobbying fund goes toward reforming what the corporation
    considers outdated and draconian technology suppression laws.\n\nAIR believes
    in the concept of radical independence. Their research is privately funded through
    their own efforts (including but not limited to advertising space sales, private
    benefactors, etc.). While they seek to maintain cordial relationships with the
    major empires of New Eden for the sake of smooth business transactions, they do
    not accept government funding for any of their projects. They believe that doing
    so would compromise the integrity of their work. They consider themselves beholden
    to no single force or faction in the cluster. \n\nThey are extremely dedicated
    to the pursuit of scientific advancement. They chafe at the cultural and legal
    limitations placed on technological advancement. For example, the restrictions
    surrounding the development of true sentience in artificial intelligence is a
    point of contention for AIR. While the corporation does have its own internal
    Ethical Review Board, they think that such limitations do a disservice to humanity.\n\nAIR's
    public relations effort seeks to present the corporation as forward thinking and
    progressive. Many of their recruitment efforts emphasize their desire to see humanity
    achieve technological heights none have seen before. They want to lead to the
    vanguard of a new golden age of scientific advancement that would rival even the
    Jove Empire at their height.\n\nIn the wake of the Triglavian Invasion and the
    damage it inflicted upon New Eden, AIR doubled down on their ideology. CEO Elida
    Balashirian put out a statement that read: \u201CRecent events have shown us that
    the divisions between us only weaken us. We know now that we are stronger together.
    Unity is our greatest asset. Some might find such unity in military might. At
    AIR, we choose to look beyond the conflicts of today and toward the vast possibility
    of tomorrow. Forward, into the future.\u201D\n"

- body: "## Programs\n\n### AIR Capsuleer Training Program\n\nThe AIR Capsuleer Training
    Program is managed and overseen by AIR Laboratories. AIR CTP provides aspiring
    pilots with everything they need to become successful capsuleers, from the acquisition
    of necessary skills to discovering their long-term career goals. AIR covers the
    cost of initial training and medical tests in exchange for aspirants permitting
    AIR to gather and study neurological and physiological data produced by the process
    of becoming a capsuleer. The goal of the program is to democratize the very expensive
    and arduous process. \n\n## Subdivisions\n\n### AIR Laboratories\nAIR Laboratories
    is the division of AIR that focuses on developing and testing groundbreaking new
    technologies. The division is responsible for the oversight and management of
    the AIR Capsuleer Training Program. AIR keeps their new and improved tech top
    secret. No one outside the organization has access to it."

    Notable People\n### Elida Balashirian\n\nElida Balashirian is one of the Association
    for Interdisciplinary Research's co-founders and currently serves as the corporation's
    Chief Executive Officer. She was born in the Gallente Federation and joined the
    Sisters of EVE after proving herself to be a child prodigy. Elida impressed the
    inner ranks of SOE before her sudden departure to form her own independent corporation.
    She has an air of mystery about her and keeps herself relatively removed from
    the daily workings of the corporation. Every now and then she emerges from her
    private workshop with an idea for a new technological marvel that AIR can pursue.
    While it is well known that she was the brains behind the updated capsule and
    cloning technology used by the corporation, the details of its inner workings
    remain shrouded in mystery.\n\n### Daisuke Ojala \n\nDaisuke Ojala is one of the
    Association for Interdisciplinary Research's co-founders and currently serves
    as the corporation's Chief Operations Officer. Ojala was born and raised in the
    Caldari State as a member of the Ishukone Corporation. Ishukone was the first
    company to receive capsule technology from the Jovians, which made the corp billions
    in revenue. Growing up, the fact that Ishukone still possesses the most advanced
    technology outside Jove space was drilled into Ojala's head, igniting within him
    the desire to surpass the corporation of his birth in terms of future forward
    technological innovation. He joined forces with Elida Balashirian to start their
    own corporation that would rival the legacy of Ishukone. Employees of AIR frequently
    refer to Ojala as the business half of the operation and Balashirian as the brains.
    \n\n### Vesper Calytrix\n\nVesper Calytrix is the Vice President of Operations
    for the Association for Interdisciplinary Research. Born in the Amarr Empire,
    Vesper was orphaned in a Blood Raider attack on the ship her family was traveling
    on. Her escape pod traveled outside of Amarr space and was retrieved by the Sisters
    of EVE who placed her in an orphanage, allowing her to grow up away from the ideological
    confines of her traditional Amarrian family. Her upbringing nurtured her intellectual
    curiosity and natural academic talents. Through her involvement with SOE, she
    met Elida Balashirian, the CEO of AIR, who recruited Vesper for the position of
    VP of Operations.\n\n### Balin Ferrus\n\nBalin Ferrus rose up through the ranks
    of the Minmatar Republic Fleet before being recruited by Daisuke Ojala to head
    AIR\u2019s private security force. In his role as Commander, Ferrus oversees the
    organization and deployment of AIR paramilitary wing while also supervising combat
    and weapons training for all AIR pilots. As a commanding officer and an instructor,
    Ferrus has a reputation for being tough but fair. He prioritizes thorough training
    and takes his responsibility for the lives of all those under his command very
    seriously.\n\n### Elias Peltonnen\n\nElias  Peltonnen is a freelance mining expert
    currently contracted to work with the Association for Interdisciplinary Research.
    Born in the Caldari State, Elias Peltonnen broke away from the Hyasyoda Corporation
    that had been served by several generations of the Peltonnen family. The strict
    boundaries of corporate life didn't suit him. His heart yearned for adventure.
    He craved both independence and individual glory, two things that aren't exactly
    prized among the corporation-driven culture of the Caldari. He struck out on his
    own, quickly discovering that he had a talent for resource harvesting. The career
    provided him with the things he craved: travel, adventure, and a ton of money.
    When AIR approached him about bringing his finely honed skills to the company's
    mining operations, he accepted the opportunity. AIR pays well and doesn't limit
    his freedom the same way his original Caldari corporation would have. Now, he
    strikes metaphorical gold for AIR\u2013and himself.   "
