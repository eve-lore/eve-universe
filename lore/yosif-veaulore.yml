- body: '**Yosif Veaulore** is a [Mannar](4BaMCkOwYaPpd4ZMtEfEY) businessman and the
    founder of Lost Stars, Inc. He is divorced from his now-deceased wife, Verine,
    and has a son, [Perime](4FTWbLWsDznVocb4juSNYc).


    After Verine died as a crew member of a [capsuleer](2klMsyfd5quK05XnGL9wNB) ship,
    Perime approached Yosif with the idea of founding Lost Stars, Inc, as a corpse
    recovery company. Yosif agreed out of pity, but the business prospered, quickly
    growing to include numerous ships. When Perime later committed several crimes,
    Yosif helped him hide under an assumed identity on board one of the retrieval
    ships.


    Once the company had grown large enough, [Quafe Company](ssPYMESgTyz1rl4fTojD6)
    bought it out - something Perime did not like, though Yosif was quite happy with
    the deal. As the months passed, however, Yosif grew disenchanted with the direction
    the company was taking under [Gehyr Aillon''s](4kOfLWgkI7AR34IBxJc0I3) leadership.
    He believed Quafe had moved the company away from helping people recover loved
    ones to simply a biomass collection service. He also found himself being locked
    out of the business by Aillon. During this time, he lost contact with his son
    and was unable to reestablish it. In the end, Aillon framed him for the [Quafe+](7LIn9llI0ZBSXDQ1VxZr2g)
    fiasco.
