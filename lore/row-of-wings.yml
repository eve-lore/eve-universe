- body: 'Housed on an unnamed ship repair station, the **Row of Wings** used to

    snake its way through the main section. It was a series of ship parts,

    most of them flat or wing-shaped, that ranged in height from that of a

    short man to the size of a two-story building. In times past, the parts

    had been used for education, both as reference pieces and as test

    housing for new module variations. Each part was held in a frame that

    consisted of two massive clamps on the floor and a wire at the top

    attached to the nearest wall. An ancient control board could loosen the

    clamps and cause the wire to fall away, allowing the piece to be moved

    by a walker. The Row of Wings was destroyed in a retirement prank.
