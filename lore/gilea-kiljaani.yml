- body: '**Gilea Kiljaani** is a rich and rather amoral young woman. She smokes, and
    has a fondness for designer logos and expensive perfumes. At one point she was
    interested in having a procedure done called a [face-swap](4OVv2l5wpw0mh2pvDdFKSv),
    and had a long talk with Vertan Vejowin to that effect. Gilea, like most others
    briefly familiar with the procedure, believed erroneously that the person whose
    face she is choosing would be put to death after.
