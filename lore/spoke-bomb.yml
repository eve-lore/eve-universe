- body: 'The **spoke bomb** is a weaponizable tool used in rescue operations.


    It consists of supercompressed constructs of interconnected tritanium

    pins encased in an isolated chamber, with a small discharger set at

    their center. When a spoke ruptures and the tritanium comes into contact

    with air (or the encased backup pocket of oxygen contained within the

    bomb), it expands violently, blowing away anything in its immediate

    vicinity. The tritanium spokes click into place and form a complex

    prismic polyhedron, similar to a hubless wheel. The spokes are perfectly

    balanced, and effectively create a hole in a wall through which a person

    can pass.


    It should be noted that they are not biased in operation, and will not

    distinguish between a hole created in a wall, a crumbling piece of metal

    wreckage, or someone''s torso.
