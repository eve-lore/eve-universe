    The Caldari State is an authoritarian militaristic nation, founded on the pillars
    of duty, loyalty, efficiency, and hard work. While not as large a society as that
    of the Gallente or the Amarr, the state is still universally respected and admired.
    Its economy is fundamentally sound and its military, despite its smaller size,
    is fully equal to that of any other empire, thanks to a well-kept fleet packed
    with cutting-edge technology.


    A nation built on corporate capitalism, the Caldari State is run by a group of
    eight megacorporations who divide territory between themselves, controlling and
    overseeing nearly every aspect of society. Each corporation comprises of thousands
    of smaller companies, ranging from industrial companies to law firms. All real
    estate is owned by the companies, which then lease it to the citizens. Government
    and policing are also both handled by independent companies funded by each of
    the megacorporations.

- body: "## History\n\nBefore the founding of the state, the Caldari were not a singular
    entity. Like their Gallente neighbors, they were composed of different races on
    different continents across Caldari Prime, although the bulk of the population
    was located on the Tikiona continent. Tikiona was united between AD 17453 and
    AD 20988 under the Raata Empire, with existing ethnicities at the time organized
    into political entities in the form of houses.\n\n![Caldari structure](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/66nRED7LtAr9hC7wZleRmJ/b5635a89ffb46c12ce5c094652b7f2a4/Caldari_structure.png)\n\n###
    First Contact\n\nThe term Caldari was coined after first contact with the Gallente
    in AD 22517, as a planetary identifier used to distinguish the races of their
    home world from those of their newfound partners. By this point, each Caldari
    race was organized into its own fully fledged nation on Caldari Prime, with minimal
    to no cross-ethnic mingling. The boundaries between these ethnicities were profound,
    not only in physical appearance, but also culturally, with the Caldari\u2019s
    concept of a nation differing vastly from the Gallente\u2019s definition, the
    latter of which tended to be built around ideology, rather than race or culture.\n\nEven
    when the megacorporations secretly colonized regions of space on behalf of their
    master nations, the Caldari continued to identify by their original ethnicity.
    This practice continued after the founding of the federation, and it was not until
    the secession of the Caldari in AD 23154 that the situation changed. When the
    Chief Executive Panel usurped control of the home world from the indigenous nations,
    all who supported the secession were swept along in the following social upheaval.\n\n###
    Corporate State\n\nAs the all-encompassing corporate state came into being, the
    Caldari psyche and society were shaped into new forms. The largest Caldari ethnicities,
    the Deteis and Civire, were deeply affected by these changes and molded to the
    norm. Other ethnicities, including the Gallente, who had long been residents of
    the Caldari home world, were brought into the fold, where all are now identified
    as one race.\n\nInfluenced by the Sukuuvestaa Corporation, a people known as the
    Achura decided to join the Caldari in their secession as a client state. Their
    preindustrial Achura Empire, which had been discovered by Sukuuvestaa during the
    secret colonization many decades prior, was uprooted and replaced by minority
    Caldari rule. This mostly affected major population centers, which were developed
    to become full cities according to the Caldari standard. Rural areas were mostly
    ignored, dotted with thousands of Achura monasteries which to this day preserve
    the culture and heritage of the Achura Empire.\n\nSome, of course, were displaced
    for industrial operations in cases where they were located on valuable land, but
    for the most part, Achura who had not been assimilated remained reclusive and
    introverted, cut off from the state as a whole and for the most part untouched
    by its influence. It was only at the beginning of the capsuleer era that the Achura
    acquired interstellar recognition, as many of them, discovering a natural aptitude,
    sought out capsuleer training.\n\n### Interstellar War\n\nOver the course of the
    Gallente-Caldari War, militant fringe groups of Intaki, experienced military personnel
    in particular, sympathized with the state and asked to join the Caldari Navy.
    Wary of the fact that the Intaki had a very different culture to the Caldari,
    but still pragmatic enough to realize the military and political benefits of enlisting
    turncoat veterans, Caldari officers placed these Intaki in segregated divisions.
    The most famous of these forces was commanded by Mordu\u2019s Legion founder Muryia
    Mordu, who led his division to its status as one of the most successful, revered,
    and battle-hardened units of the war.\n\nAt the end of the war, many of these
    Intaki were offered cheap land and accommodation in Waschi City on Kamokor IV,
    though those who had abandoned their cultural heritage and fully integrated into
    the Caldari lifestyle had long since become full citizens. Due to the fact that
    these Intaki continued to maintain their separate identity and distinct ways,
    their presence caused tension with native Caldari, especially xenophobic radicals
    who fed on the aggressive foreign policy of the state. A significant number of
    the Intaki, facing expatriation, sought assistance from their former commander,
    Muryia Mordu, a turn of events which would later lead to the formation of Mordu\u2019s
    Legion, one of the most legendary mercenary groups in New Eden\u2019s history.
    In the end, the Intaki were able to resettle in Waschi City while retaining their
    identity and culture.\n\n### Provist Regime\n\nThe meteoric rise to power of Tibus
    Heth and the Caldari Providence Directorate (CPD) in YC 110 again put emphasis
    on ethnic identity regardless of cultural compliance, the two being defined as
    synonymous with one another by the Provist government. Hundreds of thousands of
    federation expatriates were quarantined and unlawfully incarcerated, or in some
    instances deported across state borders, while full state citizens of Gallente
    origin found themselves on the violent end of angry mobs.\n\n### Present Day\n\nToday,
    the Caldari State is built on the cornerstones of patriotism and hard work that
    carried its ancestors through the hardships of living on an inhospitable, barren
    home world."

- body: "## Megacorporations\n\nThe eight largest and most influential corporations
    within the Caldari State are as follows:\n\n### CBD\n\n![CBD logo](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/1AszrDjH1LMOKCiLNQngQH/81c56f6836cb3b3b0de26d69a1607f2b/CBD.png#right)\n\nThe
    CBD Corporation is one of the biggest import-export specialists in Caldari space.
    It has established trade links across the cluster, with a huge amount of goods
    in constant flux across the borders of the Caldari State. Though relatively young
    in years as far as Caldari megacorporations go, CBD has built up a tremendous
    net of associates over its comparatively brief lifespan, and is today quite possibly
    the megacorporation most connected with every level of Caldari society.\n\nCBD
    has been known to call in favors from questionable elements of society when more
    traditional channels have failed, and out of all the Big Eight\u2019s members,
    it has become known as one of the most ruthless with its business practices, though
    it is not above the occasional bit of extravagant philanthropy\u2014if it serves
    CBD\u2019s interests and proves to result in positive public relations.\n\n###
    Hyasyoda\n\n![Hyasyoda logo](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/1Qjhn1MsQGzKNowV0269lm/c9dcb0c2a5782d7f6e8693d4c4c627df/Hyasyoda.png#right)\nHyasyoda
    is one of the oldest Caldari megacorporations, formed shortly after contact with
    the Gallente. Conservative and cautious in its business dealings, Hyasyoda focuses
    mainly on tried and tested subsistence industries, such as agriculture, mining,
    and consumer products. Its operations are largely confined to the state itself,
    although it has partnerships with foreign companies to market its many products
    in foreign territories. Hyasyoda was also the first corporation to champion development
    of the MTAC for use in the inhospitable polar regions of Caldari Prime, before
    making the blueprints commercially available and working with the Caldari armed
    forces during the First Gallente-Caldari War to upgrade and arm them for combat
    use. The corporation still holds the rights to many fundamental MTAC design principles,
    property that it fiercely protects to this day.\n\nHyasyoda\u2019s corporate culture
    has evolved very little over its long history. It is an extremely conservative
    organization, with business strategies that lean heavily toward old-fashioned
    corporatism and established tradition. The corporation is still largely controlled
    by the family that founded it, and the social pressure on Hyasyoda employees to
    conform is as great as ever, even for the Caldari State, where such pressure is
    a part of daily life.\n\nWhen the Caldari Providence Directorate came to power,
    Hyasyoda was one of the loudest critics of the political arrangement and often
    led opposition to Executor Heth within the CEP, alongside Ishukone.\n\n### Ishukone\n\n![Ishukone
    logo](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/27NPv79GCvJmQDnD2BMEZV/0500f84b8deb768c84323e9754ceed5a/Ishukone.png#right)\nUnder
    the guidance of late CEO Otro Gariushi, Ishukone became one of the leading corporations
    in the cluster, specializing in the production of high-tech equipment and machinery.
    It possesses some of the most advanced technology outside of Jovian space, and
    was instrumental in the development of capsuleer technology and capsulebased flight.\n\nIshukone
    was for a long time the weakest of the Caldari megacorporations. Its main business
    model initially revolved around research and development, though it was rarely
    able to benefit greatly from any of its discoveries. Only in the last century
    or so has it bloomed, and it is now in the process of becoming one of the most
    powerful corporations in the Caldari State. Well known for maintaining an exceptionally
    high standard of living and support for its employees under the regime of Otro
    Gariushi, the corporation continues to follow this legacy under its new CEO, Mens
    Reppola.\n\nThe harshest and most open critic of both the Caldari Providence Directorate
    and Tibus Heth, Ishukone came close to bankruptcy during Heth\u2019s five-year
    reign as executor of the Caldari State, due to both an expensive philanthropic
    legacy left behind by Otro Gariushi and trade restrictions placed on its dealings
    by the CPD as a consequence of its opposition. The Ishukone Corporation now also
    administrates the Caldari Districts on Caldari Prime, after the Gallente Federation\u2019s
    successful execution of Operation Highlander, which removed the Leviathan-class
    titan Shiigeru from orbit, ending the half-decade-long siege of the Caldari home
    world.\n\n### Kaalakiota\n\n![Kaalakiota logo](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/4QEY88hBy0ZQ05CmOdwBX6/d944ea3425728d2dd1f91b5857ae8ba3/Kaalakiota.png#right)\nLed
    by the revered business tycoon Haatakan Oiritsuu, Kaalakiota (or KK, as it is
    affectionately known) is the largest megacorporation in the state. KK has its
    fingers everywhere, and in everything.\n\nGiven its sheer size, Kaalakiota is
    the closest of the corporations to being a state within the State. Its humble
    beginnings date back to when the Caldari people were under the wing of the Gallente
    Federation. The corporation initially dabbled in trade with the Gallente, but
    soon became hugely successful in real estate, construction, and manufacturing.
    KK was at the forefront of the Caldari opposition against the Gallente Federation,
    a fact that is still used to great political effect today.\n\nAfter the rise to
    prominence of Tibus Heth during the Caldari Constructions riots of YC 110, and
    his subsequent usurping of Oiritsuu from the chief executive position that she
    had held for four decades, Kaalakiota suffered half a decade of heavy mismanagement
    and misappropriation of corporate funding that brought it close to filing for
    bankruptcy. After Heth was forcibly removed from office, a number of fire sales
    of assets from smaller corporations within its portfolio allowed the corporation
    to maintain solvency. Still the largest and most powerful of the Big Eight, Kaalakiota
    is now on the road to recovery after the reinstatement of Oiritsuu as chief executive,
    five years after she was forced to part ways with the corporation by the Caldari
    Providence Directorate.\n\n### Lai Dai\n\n![Lai Dai logo](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/6skSUVgWnb1xldNdIGVYOg/9adf268f36cc5d93bea31245b913600f/Lai_Dai.png#right)\nLai
    Dai has always advocated quality over quantity, taking pride in designing and
    manufacturing products of the highest standard. With several energetic research
    programs that rival the great Ishukone in their scope and forward-thinking audacity,
    Lai Dai is the maker of a vast and varied range of products, from high-tech medical
    equipment to the latest battlefield hardware.\n\nAfter the First Gallente-Caldari
    War, Lai Dai, which at the time was a relatively small conglomerate mostly focused
    on research, began branching out and investing in the Amarr and Khanid corporations,
    supplying them with an infusion of technological creativity and forming corporate
    and political bonds that last to this day. Through the years, this enterprise
    has occasionally created conflicts of interest within the politics of the state,
    but Lai Dai\u2019s ideals and true devotion to Caldari above all else have always
    gotten it out of whatever political trouble it has found itself in.\n\n### Nugoeihuvi\n\n![Nugoeihuvi
    logo](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/1HFJXCWD20TpvoIzwvyII9/68c139147e2e4c46f3357c1ce9146c10/Nugoeihuvi.png#right)\nUsually
    referred to by its corporate moniker, NOH, Nugoeihuvi was originally a conglomerate
    of small companies that manufactured all manner of luxury goods, ranging from
    mobile delicatessen units to quality furniture. Once the Caldari had formed their
    independent empire, this enterprising group quickly moved to fill the void created
    when the Gallente entertainment business was cut out, and over the years NOH has
    gradually made entertainment its main focus.\n\nTime and time again, the corporation
    has been accused of underworld dealings and links to a number of organized-crime
    syndicates within the state, as well as the Guristas Pirates. These rumors, however,
    have never been substantiated.\n\n### Sukuuvestaa\n\n![Sukuuvestaa logo](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/6Q5PSfOeFtevIReYpLlmbS/284ff68edafe0a35ded12fdd0baa4843/Sukuuvestaa.png#right)\nSukuuvestaa,
    or SuVee as it is more commonly called, is the second-largest Caldari megacorporation.
    Heavily focused on agriculture, mining, real estate, and consumer products, it
    owns, according to estimates from the House of Records, over a third of all Caldari
    real estate, when the assets of its subsidiaries are included.\n\nSuVee has a
    reputation as one of the state\u2019s most ruthless corporations, seizing smaller
    rivals and selling off the spoils of hostile takeovers to ensure its dominance
    in whichever market sector it chooses. While this often causes tensions between
    it and the other megacorporations (particularly Kaalakiota, SuVee\u2019s most
    hated rival), it has also forced competitors to think twice about challenging
    Sukuuvestaa in any market where it has significant influence.\n\nThroughout the
    ages, several scandals involving questionable gain of property and loss of innocent
    life have been quelled by SuVee\u2019s extensive PR department, known to be the
    most skilled of its kind operating in the Caldari State, and quite possibly the
    whole cluster.\n\n### Wiyrkomi\n\n![Wiyrkomi logo](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/6ImPbHT8wNQ3iNaa7r7nmw/1f1423900451a067c7ea811263593902/Wiyrkomi.png#right)\nKnown
    and respected throughout New Eden, the Seituoda family name has been the driving
    force behind the Wiyrkomi Corporation ever since its inception over a century
    ago, in the years preceding the Gallente-Caldari War.\n\nWith a reputation built
    upon the unimpeachable word of its founder, Tyunaul Seituoda, Wiyrkomi continues
    to enjoy unique relationships with many of New Eden\u2019s most influential corporations.
    Given the reputation of most megacorporations, Wiyrkomi is regarded by those inside
    and outside the state as a curious anomaly, due to its reputation for strait-laced
    business practices\u2014though, as many an unwary competitor has learned over
    the years, this does not make it any less of a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe
    Seituoda family has long been known as one of the most loyal and patriotic entities
    within the Caldari State, commanding immense respect and remaining concerned with
    the promotion of Caldari ideals above all else. Though members of the family have
    become more reclusive in the wake of a few odious scandals in the last century,
    their corporate contacts remain as loyal as ever, due in no small part to the
    Wiyrkomi Corporation\u2019s proven track record of unswerving allegiance to the
    state at large, as well as the corporation\u2019s own particular allies and associates."

- body: "## Political Structure\n\nWhile the state is built on corporate capitalism,
    which gives the corporations dictatorial powers, they are just as bound by Caldari
    customs and laws as the individual, and the fierce, continual competition between
    the corporations ensures a healthy, consumer-based social environment which benefits
    everyone.\n\n### The Chief Executive Panel\n\nTogether, the \u201CBig Eight\u201D
    (the nickname for the eight megacorporations who handle most domestic matters)
    own more than 90 percent of all property within the state. Each of the eight is
    made up of thousands of companies of various sizes, ranging from simple mining
    companies to powerful police organizations. Each corporation rules its territories
    like its own kingdom, with its own corporate law and little interference on domestic
    affairs from the Chief Executive Panel (CEP).\n\nThe Chief Executive Panel is
    a political entity which itself is jointly owned and run by the Caldari megacorporations.
    The CEOs of the megacorporations sit on the board of the panel to ensure that
    the companies are kept in line when competing with each other, smoothing over
    potential conflicts before they escalate out of control. The panel also handles
    the foreign policy of the Caldari State, and is the closest thing to a government
    that the Caldari have. The Chief Executive Panel also holds executive authority
    over the Caldari Navy, with the power to dictate any offensive or defensive actions
    deemed necessary to preserve the security of the state.\n\n### House of Records\n\nOwing
    to this rather fragmented style of leadership, the House of Records was also established
    by mutual agreement to act as a central source for record keeping within the Caldari
    State. The House of Records acts as a national archive, digitally storing vast
    quantities of data that detail every transaction, business deal, and governmental
    interaction within the state.\n\n### Caldari Business Tribunal\n\nThe Caldari
    Business Tribunal (CBT) was established by mutual consent of the CEP. The CBT
    is regarded as the second most powerful entity within the state, operating independently
    of the Big Eight and authorized to mediate in, modify, or cancel any deal, transaction,
    or agreement made between corporations within the state.\n\n### Corporate Blocs\n\nFrom
    the outside, to uninformed eyes, the Caldari State appears to be a solid and unified
    corporate meritocracy. While this has been true for short periods over its history,
    typically during times of great trouble for the Caldari people, there are three
    distinct ideological blocs within the state that have grown ever more apparent
    as Caldari society has evolved.\n\nThe first of these three blocs, the Practicals,
    is headed by the second largest megacorporation in the Caldari State, Sukuuvestaa.
    Commonly known as the Exploiters, the group also includes both the CBD Corporation
    and Nugoeihuvi. These corporations have practiced unethical business tactics for
    decades and are frequently associated with organized crime.\n\nThe Practicals
    see the other empires as potential markets ready to be exploited by unrestricted
    and unregulated trade, caring more for their bottom line than for who is a friend
    with whom, and even less about what long-term political ramifications their unscrupulous
    business practices can have. Basically mercantilist in their views on trade, they
    believe that profit for one always means loss for another, and they will stop
    at very little to ensure the state always comes out on top.\n\nThe second of these
    three groups are the Liberals, whose views completely contradict those of the
    Practicals in regards to interstellar trade. The Liberal bloc believes in fostering
    improved relations with all the other empires, creating an interstellar environment
    where there are no trade barriers and where goods and services flow freely across
    borders. They believe in trade deals that mutually benefit the participants and
    that the empires can come together in a peaceful, prosperous future world only
    through cooperation and unified trade.\n\nThe liberals are led by the extremely
    influential Ishukone Corporation and also include the Hyasyoda megacorporation
    and Ishukone\u2019s daughter corporation, Zainou Biotech. The state\u2019s strong
    position within CONCORD is maintained and accentuated by the Liberal bloc\u2019s
    belief that promoting universal peace so that trade can flow freely and cultures
    mingle peacefully is paramount to ensuring economic stability for the state.\n\nThe
    final group is less concerned about trade than about the position that the Caldari
    State holds in contrast to the other empires, in terms of both military capability
    and economic strength. These are the Patriots, and they are led by the monolithic
    Kaalakiota Corporation, which is the largest megacorporation in the Caldari State,
    followed by the Lai Dai and Wiyrkomi corporations.\n\nThe Patriots seek to cultivate
    the Caldari heritage, and may often be found reminiscing about the great Raata
    Empire of old or weeping for their lost home world, Caldari Prime. The most fanatical
    of them cry for a renewal of the war with the federation, but they are a minority.
    The majority sees economic dominance across the cluster as a tool to promote military
    power. The Patriots are willing to negotiate alternative ways to acquire Caldari
    Prime other than through war, but they know they can only realize that dream by
    convincing the federation of the economic and, most importantly, militaristic
    superiority of the Caldari State. They strive to promote a state that outshines
    the federation in every possible way.\n\n### Finances\n\nMore than any other faction,
    the Caldari State has a fixation on its finances and financial systems. The State
    has no central currency, with each megacorporation using its own scrip. Independent
    corporations use the scrip of a patron corporation or the ISK. Each megacorporation
    is then built around a massive investment bank, which forms a skeleton for each
    individual corporate empire.\n\n[Caldari Funds Unlimited](caldari-funds-unlimited)
    serves as the closest Caldari equivalent to a central bank, in addition to performing
    many of the functions of a normal financial institution. Seaguard Financial was
    a competitor to the major Caldari banks until YC29, when it was placed under \"extreme
    sanction\" by the [Chief Executive Panel](5OC2T1uqCSy4NUPhhpq9Xr) and destroyed
    through corporate warfare."

- body: "## Military\n\nThe rule of the megacorporations extends not only to the financial
    system, but to the military branch of government as well. Each of the corporations
    runs their own military and police force.\n\nCorporate police forces have legal
    authority to act as police proxies within corporate jurisdiction, though in cases
    where the regional police have a presence their authority supersedes corporate
    police. It should be noted that within the corporate security forces, police duty
    is considered a lower form of duty than military duty. \n\nPolice work on stations
    in the State is an especially nightmarish task due to the red tape involved in
    numerous jurisdictions involved when various parts of the station and their owners
    come into play. While corporate police forces do not have the best reputation
    for dealing with lesser infractions, especially non-violent crimes, they can nonetheless
    quickly and efficiently deal with matters when circumstances require.\n\nOn the
    more overtly militaristic side, it's notable that the eight private militaries
    of the megacorporations exceed the Caldari State military in numbers and often
    surpass it in training. The military branches of the megacorporations originate
    from shortly after the [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV), when Kaalakiota
    and Sukuuvestaa established theirs as a result of a dispute over postwar development.\n\nCaldari
    corporate militaries have traditionally been used as a propaganda tool, using
    their successes and image to enhance the reputation of the parent corporation
    and vice versa. It's notable that some military functions, such as engineering
    work, appear to be outsourced to civilian personnel - including technicians in
    charge of setting up listening posts, who do not appear to hold Navy ranks."

- body: "## Culture and Society\n\nWhile the Caldari State may not be nearly as big
    as the Gallente Federation, let alone the Amarr Empire, it is still universally
    feared and admired. With a strong economy and military might to match that of
    the larger empires, not to mention the fact that it is more unscrupulous than
    the Gallente and more combative than the Amarr, the state is in many ways the
    most formidable of all the empires.\n\nAs most Caldari trade is conducted on the
    blurred divider between corporation and nation-state, it can be difficult for
    the other empires to deal with it at the political level. If a company is found
    guilty of unethical business dealings, it simply disappears into its parent corporation,
    and before long another one appears to take its place. If a Caldari company is
    threatened, meanwhile, the whole corporation and often the whole state will more
    often than not back it with full force.\n\n![Caldari barracks](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/6g9cHwmsL2sWvPz0UBaYHH/a520e50b3d8a3a96f9a47e08bb4e4f0b/caldari_cluster_mood.png)\n\n###
    Military Tradition\n\nMilitary tradition is a core part of Caldari society and
    heritage. As a people, its citizens fought a long and bloody war to gain their
    independence, eventually surrendering their home planet to the Gallente Federation
    in order to preserve their way of life. It was at this time that the corporations
    established themselves as the driving force behind creating and maintaining the
    Caldari State. Even though the Caldari have not engaged in all-out war for almost
    a century, they still strive to be at the cutting edge of military technology,
    and their vessels, weapons, and fighting methods are second to none.\n\nTo curb
    their aggressive tendencies, Caldari citizens are encouraged to actively pursue
    a range of sporting activities, often sponsored by the state itself. Many of these
    are bloody competitions in the vein of gladiatorial combat, while others take
    the form of races and contests. Whatever the sport, they love betting on the outcome,
    making gambling a massive industry in the state and a core pillar of Caldari society.\n\n###
    Caldari Society\nThe state offers its citizens the best and the worst in living
    conditions. As long as you keep in line, do your part for the greater good, and
    obey corporate law, life can be fairly pleasant and productive. However, to those
    not cut out for this strict, disciplined regime, life quickly becomes intolerable.
    Individuals who cannot fit into the regimented framework of Caldari society often
    find themselves losing their respect, family, and social status with unsettling
    rapidity, being left with few options besides ritual suicide or exile. Although
    not xenophobic as such, the Caldari are very protective of their way of life and
    tolerate only those foreigners that stick to the rules.\n\nGiven that megacorporations
    define their citizens\u2019 identities, the differences between the Deteis and
    Civire can be observed in their social habits, formal interactions, and philosophical
    approaches to being Caldari, rather than more overt ethnic markers. There is considerable
    academic debate over whether they can even be considered distinct ethnicities.
    Their characteristic social habits are a product of their upbringing, emphasized
    as a constituent heritage of the wider Caldari identity but otherwise not regarded
    as an important aspect of a citizen\u2019s life. Those outside the state generally
    do not make a distinction between these social habits, instead considering them
    all to be an overall part of Caldari culture, a view the Caldari are more than
    happy to encourage.\n\nDespite identifying as one collective Caldari unit, the
    Deteis and Civire rarely intermarry. The corporate-controlled marriage system
    segregates members of opposing genders (same-sex marriage is neither recognized
    nor legal within Caldari borders, a frequent topic of controversy between the
    Caldari and the considerably more liberal Gallente). This grouping is based on
    similarities in physical appearance, alongside other considerations, such as personal
    compatibility and socioeconomic standing. Maintaining consistency in physical
    appearance over the generations is seen as just one of the many necessities in
    the preservation of the history and tradition of the Caldari people.\n\nThe integrated
    nature of New Eden\u2019s interstellar economy has seen many listed Caldari space
    stations become notably cosmopolitan, as has occurred across all four empires.
    Space trade hubs such as Jita 4-4 see travelers and cultures from across the cluster.
    However, these areas only make up a minute fraction of the state. On planets and
    elsewhere, the Caldari culture continues to dominate, though the Gallente economic
    and cultural influence established centuries ago (as well as its continuing efforts
    to permeate the state) never truly left.\n\n### Caldari Spirituality\nWhile the
    Caldari are essentially a secular culture, there is no shortage of myth contained
    within their cultural heritage. Stories and folklore dating back to the early
    days of the Raata Empire can be found permeating every stratum of society, and
    though the Caldari do not view their mythical symbols in an overtly religious
    way, there is easily as much distilled wisdom to be found in their countless fables
    as in all of the Amarr Scriptures put together. The spiritual tradition is considered
    a part of the \"Caldari Way\" and is sometimes specifically discussed under the
    name \"Wayism\".\n\nEver since the time of the Raata Empire, the Caldari have
    found great purpose through their mythology, and they are great lovers of aphorisms
    and sententious poems. Though they certainly harbor a propensity for rigid traditionalism,
    they have little use for organized religion or dogmatic screeds. Such things seem
    to them a waste of time, energy, and resources. However, and no matter how much
    they themselves might deny it, there is a marked spiritual streak in the Caldari
    soul, particularly among the Achura.\n\nCaldari [spirituality](6ViqPOTE9TOkwWd1CL8b10)
    could be more accurately be described as a system of thought or a philosophy than
    a religion, though many Caldari would not even go that far. One term for it in
    the Caldari language is *Kutuoto Miru* (best translated as \u201Cmind tool\u201D),
    essentially a set of practical techniques meant to help an individual maximize
    his focus, equanimity, and mental fortitude. The practice of Kutuoto Miru within
    the Caldari Way has expanded from an ancient core to include numerous sub-disciplines
    of mind and body, including martial forms.\n\nThe foundation upon which practice
    of Kutuoto Miru rests is the activity of \u201Cpiercing the veil\u201D\u2014essentially,
    reaching beyond one\u2019s subjective interpretations of worldly phenomena and
    ideas to perceive the impassionate reality beneath it all. This exercise is said
    to remove extraneous clutter from the mind, sharpening it for whatever task is
    at hand. It is also said to calm the waters of a competitive intellect roiling
    with hopes of power and victory, ensuring that the desire for glory so powerfully
    instilled in all Caldari doesn\u2019t run away with the individual. \n\nIn Kutuoto
    Miru practice it is entirely possible, in fact rather common, for there to be
    no mention of any kind of deity and no inkling of any sort of worship\u2014indeed,
    as far as many corporate Caldari can be said to worship anything, it is reality
    itself that they revere.\n"

- body: "## Growing Up in the State\n\nThe Caldari home world, Caldari Prime, was
    an exceedingly inhospitable planet when the first colonists settled there many
    thousands of years ago. In order for them to survive in the wake of the EVE Gate\u2019s
    collapse, it was necessary to adopt stringent social and behavioral codes and
    to inculcate in their children a love for discipline and merit. Being good at
    something became not just desirable but simply a necessary survival trait, and
    therefore it naturally followed that the better you were at something, the more
    value you brought to society. \n\nFrom birth, a Caldari child is bound to the
    corporate state. Almost universally, children are born in corporate medical facilities
    under the supervision of the best specialist the parents\u2019 rank and status
    dictates. Any genetic manipulation, implants, or other treatments are also assigned
    on the basis of the family\u2019s contribution to the state.\n\nFamilies wishing
    for better care can work out an agreement with their individual employers. This
    usually involves borrowing additional funds and paying them back over time out
    of the parents\u2019 salaries. Many families will take this option to cover low-cost
    procedures, but it is typically regarded as socially unacceptable to seek out
    expensive and extravagant procedures.\n\nThereafter, with the assistance of a
    variety of childcare corporations, parents raise and monitor the child closely.
    Early on, children learn games that help observers to assess intelligence, physical
    prowess, and aggressive tendencies. These activities help educational corporations
    work with families to decide what schooling best suits the child.\n\nA family
    can pay for superior training if they desire, but once again unnecessary spending
    is discouraged and often does not help a child\u2019s advancement. Once of age
    to enter school, children are taught a variety of subjects. The exact curriculum
    varies based on the corporation overseeing each child\u2019s education, but basic
    economics and the history and philosophy of the Caldari State are universal.\n\nThe
    basic curriculum prepares the students for talentbased specialty schools later
    in their education. Grading is invariably done on a curve to promote competition,
    and rewards are given to students with consistently superior marks. Exceptional
    or underperforming students are reevaluated and may be moved to different schools
    as a result.\n\nTeamwork exercises are mixed with competitive grading to produce
    students who embody both ambition and cooperation. In addition to academics, children
    are encouraged to socialize with their fellow students in other ways. Much of
    this adolescent socializing is done around various clubs and extracurricular activities
    where new members usually must pass some sort of entrance test to be accepted.\n\nStudents
    tend to socialize with fellow club members, and members often compete internally
    for leadership roles and privileges. Teamwork is also emphasized, though, with
    a variety of competitions pitting the members of one group against another. Prizes
    for success are special privileges and resources for the club and its members.
    \n\nThrough these extracurricular activities, Caldari children are introduced
    to a number of competitive sports. Martial arts, contact sports, and games combining
    creativity with tactical cunning are the most popular. Exceptional performance
    in these activities often results in acknowledgement and privilege, and talent
    scouts for the professional leagues monitor potential stars as early as elementary
    school.\n\nInjuries are common in this domain, but medical care in the state is
    first among the empires, and is additionally free of charge to citizens. Attendance
    at these sporting events is a major pastime for both children and their parents.
    The military also takes an active role in a child\u2019s life. Most schools teach
    basic military history, and soldiers regularly come to speak to classes and discuss
    careers in the service.\n\nSo strong is the nation\u2019s military tradition that
    after formal schooling is completed, every citizen must complete a very basic
    form of military training and three years of conscripted state military service
    before beginning his working life, even if she is not headed for a military career.
    This is one of the fundamental reasons why the state is able to mobilize so quickly
    in case of national emergency.\n\nBy the time a child graduates from secondary
    school, he is well on his way to his career. The student and his family are provided
    with a list of corporate-approved universities and academies appropriate to his
    academic level.\n\nThough students can go to more prestigious schools if their
    families pay the extra education costs back to the state, most students simply
    attend the best school picked for them. In almost all cases where a student would
    want to make his own choice, he would base his decision on which school would
    maximize his natural abilities in such a way that he could offer the maximum benefit
    to the state.\n\nCaldari universities and academies are very similar in structure
    to earlier schooling\u2014grading is curved; socialization is based around activities
    and studies that test creativity, logic, strategy, and other traits deemed useful
    to the state; and the successful are earmarked for placement within the upper
    ranks of Caldari society.\n\nUpon reaching adulthood, a Caldari individual will
    have been tempered in the fires of adversity and competition. He will have learned
    to view himself as a vital part of Caldari society, and he will have also learned
    that the winners benefit the most from that same society."

- body: "## Bloodlines\n\nIn a very similar manner to the Gallente, Caldari citizens
    tend to place little to no emphasis on ethnicity. Most will always identify as
    Caldari first, followed by their loyalty to their parent corporation. Their ethnic
    heritage comes third, if it is mentioned at all.\n\nEthnic Caldari account for
    95\u201399 percent of the state\u2019s registered citizenry, with the remaining
    percentage made up mainly of expatriates from other empires. Due to the socially
    demanding nature of Caldari culture and the various bureaucratic hurdles involved,
    the state has the lowest rate of immigration among all the empires. Additionally,
    full citizenship and its myriad benefits can never be granted to anyone born elsewhere.
    Thus, foreigners living in the Caldari State more often than not find themselves
    working hard to prove their mettle, but receiving little in the way of appreciation
    from either the authorities or the populace.\n\nAlthough technically composed
    of multiple ethnicities that have descended from Caldari Prime (the Civire and
    Deteis being the most populous of these by far), all Caldari are identified to
    be of a single race, according to both popular tradition and their parent megacorporations.
    Today, the Civire and Deteis make up almost all of the Caldari State\u2019s registered
    population, with Achura, ethnic Gallente, and Intaki as the largest minorities,
    in that order.\n\n### Deteis\n\nThe Deteis symbolize what it means to be Caldari
    in every way. Efficient, dutiful, and hard working, to most they are the epitome
    of a model Caldari citizen. Deteis can commonly be found in positions of authority
    within the military and political spheres, which suits their mellow temperament
    very well. Considered by some to be more cunning and underhanded than the Civire,
    they share the traits of duty, discipline, and diligence.\n\nRegarded as slightly
    more inquisitive and eager to learn than the Civire, the Deteis share a firm belief
    that the good of the whole must come before the needs of the individual. This
    has greatly influenced the shaping of the Caldari State since its foundation.\n\n###
    Civire\n\nIn the eyes of most, the Civire form the rock-solid backbone of the
    Caldari State. Their diligence and selfless efforts have built it from the ground
    up. The Civire are cool, level headed, and relentless in their approach to both
    trading and fighting. In business, their trademark is often said to be straightforward,
    aboveboard dealing, where every aspect of a business transaction is planned to
    the letter. Militarily, their actions are direct, well measured, and never hasty.
    They are more comfortable acting than talking and are never happier than when
    embroiled in the midst of frenetic activity. They can handle pressure extremely
    well, an invaluable trait in combat and other high-intensity situations. Many
    of the best bounty hunters and military commanders in New Eden are Civire.\n\n###
    Achura\n\nThough the Achura have been part of the Caldari State for a little over
    three centuries, they have remained something of a mystery. Hailing from the inhospitable
    Saisio system in the Forge, they are as reclusive as a political entity can be
    while still managing to participate in interstellar affairs. Intensely spiritual,
    the average Achura has little interest in the material world\u2019s distractions.
    Achura pilots have been few and far between in the past, but the desecration of
    their home world, as well as a recently discovered aptitude for the peculiar type
    of focus required by the capsuleer profession, has prompted them to take to the
    skies in greater numbers.\n\n### Other Bloodlines\n\n#### Gallente\nThe remaining
    population of the state is composed mainly of peoples of ethnic Gallente, Intaki,
    and Khanid origin. State citizens of ethnic Gallente origin tend to have some
    Civire or Deteis ancestry, can trace their roots back to origins on Caldari Prime,
    and typically identify with only one of these two groups. The majority of these
    citizens were residents of Caldari Prime who took part in the evacuation to the
    newly formed state. These ethnic Gallente may also be Intaki, Mannar, of another
    federal ethnicity, or at least have some ancestry from these groups. The vast
    majority no longer identify as Gallente and tend to be widely considered by both
    themselves and others to be of the Caldari race.\n\nRadical Caldari who emphasize
    ethnic origin as being intrinsically tied to Caldari identity often tend to target
    these groups, though this applies to any citizen not descended from Caldari Prime
    or of ethnic Caldari origin. One of the more notable instances of this prejudice
    occurred on Urlen II following Tibus Heth\u2019s reclamation of Caldari Prime
    in YC 110, when almost a thousand state citizens of Gallente origin were killed
    by an angry mob. There were, of course, conflicting reports as to whether their
    deaths came as retribution for attempting to incite violence in response to the
    state invasion of Luminaire.\n\n#### Intaki\nThe Intaki minority in the state
    no longer possess any trappings of their Intaki background. They are either considered
    full Caldari, or they retain their unique identity and culture in client communities
    across the state. The largest of these communities is in Waschi City on Kamokor
    IV. The ruling authorities of these latter Intaki groups must constantly act to
    ensure they are not victims of persecution by Caldari citizens or subject to exploitation
    by megacorporations.\n\nIntaki regarded as Caldari sympathizers can also be found
    in the state. Those with valuable skills, such as military or corporate turncoats,
    are brought into the fold and sheltered by the megacorporations. There are some
    Intaki immigrants, but the majority of these fail to adjust to the stark differences
    between their own culture and that of the Caldari and swiftly fall to the fringes
    of state society.\n\n#### Khanid\nThe shared cultural emphasis on martial and
    mercantile ability has seen many Khanid successfully set up homes and businesses
    in the state. They exist as something of an anomaly, sharing many traits with
    the Achura. While all of the immigrants who come to the state are more or less
    expected to abandon their previous identities and cultures, the Khanid are free
    to continue identifying as such due to the mutual respect shared with the Caldari.
    \n\nLikewise, as with all foreigners, they are expected to abide by the rules\u2014but
    punishment for failing to do so, for a Khanid, is lax in comparison to other groups
    from outside the state. Their religion can be practiced in private (although the
    Caldari typically do not make a big distinction between public and private spheres),
    though more extreme elements of Khanid culture, such as slavery, are unsurprisingly
    not tolerated."

- body: "## Notable Characters\n\n### Otro Gariushi\n\nOtro Gariushi was CEO of Ishukone
    from YC 100 until his death in YC 110. Unbeknownst to the general public, Gariushi
    was a former Guristas Pirate with a twenty-five-million-ISK bounty on his head,
    whose actions led to the private disgrace of preceding CEO Les Akkilen, as well
    as the field testing of the first prototype Scorpion-class battleship.\n\nAfter
    a turbulent childhood on an Ishukone-owned mining colony on Drenali VII and subsequent
    rough years with the Guristas Pirates, Gariushi was taken under the wing of his
    father\u2019s partner in crime and from then on began a campaign of sabotage against
    the Ishukone Corporation, whose members had orchestrated his father\u2019s death
    some years before. Eventually, after revealing the gross corruption of the corporation\u2019s
    CEO and demonstrating the capability of the prototype battleship in combat, Gariushi
    earned himself a reputation as a Caldari-first leader, mending the bitterness
    caused by his predecessor.\n\nHis remarkable work ethic and humane treatment of
    citizens under his corporation\u2019s employ impressed the Caldari elite, earning
    Otro near-celebrity status in the state. Renowned for the prominent skull-and-crossbones
    tattoo on his cheekbone and his spectacularly ugly features, he also cut an unusual
    and intimidating figure at business meetings\u2014a fact he always played to his
    advantage.\n\nGariushi was killed in the attacks on Ishukone\u2019s headquarters
    on May 15, YC 110, when the Nyx-class supercarrier FNS Wandering Saint slammed
    into the station, killing hundreds of thousands during a Caldari-Gallente economic
    summit.\n\n### Haatakan Oiritsuu\n\nOf Deteis descent, Oiritsuu is regarded as
    one of the most versatile and cunning businesswomen in the entire Caldari State.
    Serving as the chief executive of Kaalakiota for almost four decades before being
    driven into exile at her home on the outskirts of the Caldari metropolis of Khyyrth,
    she is known for her calm and controlled demeanor, which belies her immense presence
    at the boardroom table.\n\nOiritsuu grew up in a family environment where everything
    she said or did was remembered, judged, and later exemplified when warranted.
    Tending a small garden behind her childhood home was one method she used to cope
    with this environment, and it was there she made herself a promise to become powerful
    and rich, \u201Ca million times more wealthy than the second-wealthiest man in
    the world,\u201D she said. She has a penchant for eccentric gardening involving
    the cultivation of all manner of exotic plants in a vast greenhouse attached to
    what she terms her \u201Cpalace.\u201D\n\nA patient woman of dizzying intellect,
    Oiritsuu is renowned for laying complex plans which may take years to come to
    fruition, and does not believe in allowing automation or any other outside process
    to rule her life. Recently reinstated to her position as chief executive of Kaalakiota,
    she has been charged with bringing the corporation back to profitability after
    a half decade of mismanagement and misappropriation by Tibus Heth\u2019s regime.\n\n###
    Tibus Heth\n\nLittle is known about Heth prior to YC 105, when he was dismissed
    from his position as a Home Guard soldier after a series of racially motivated
    attacks on several station inhabitants. He went on to become an MTAC operator
    at Caldari Constructions and was later named Employee of the Month. The reward
    for this distinction was a mechanical pocket watch. As he prefers things he can
    fix himself, Heth is reportedly quite fond of this memento.\n\nHe rose to prominence
    in YC 110 via an uprising at the Caldari Constructions facility in the Piak system.
    His actions, especially a much-publicized scene of him braving Home Guard fire
    to rescue a wounded comrade, generated massive support from the rank-and-file
    Caldari. To everyone\u2019s surprise, the incident ended when Xavier Black, an
    agent of unknown affiliation, secured control of Caldari Constructions and appointed
    Tibus Heth as CEO.\n\nFollowing the Malkalen catastrophe later that year, Heth\u2019s
    particular brand of anti-Gallente patriotism fanned the flames of war, with the
    majority of Caldari corporations pledging themselves to Heth\u2019s new Caldari
    Providence Directorate, effectively making Tibus Heth dictator of the Caldari
    State, a position he then used to institute a series of reforms intended to bring
    the Caldari back to a meritocratic society.\n\nThe Minmatar Elder attack on the
    CONCORD headquarters in Yulai created an opportunity for Heth to initiate a massive
    invasion of the federation with singleminded intent: the recapture of Caldari
    Prime. Subsequently, Caldari Prime became a bubble of Caldari territory inside
    federation space.\n\nAfter a number of gaffes in leadership due to instability
    caused by a wasting affliction known as Derj\u2019s disease, Heth\u2019s gradual
    fall from grace culminated in a successfully executed operation by the Federation
    Navy to remove Caldari Navy and Caldari Providence Directorate forces from the
    orbit of Caldari Prime. This has come to be regarded by many as the final nail
    in the casket for Heth\u2019s political career. Within two weeks, after a failed
    attempt at besieging a Caldari Constructions station in the Caldari-Gallente border
    system of Haatomo, Heth was removed from office as executor of the Caldari State,
    and forced to flee into the border zone to avoid being captured and tried for
    war crimes and multiple terrorism charges.\n\nAlthough Heth remains at large,
    on October 3, YC 115, wreckage from two of his escort vessels was found in the
    system of Hakonen in Lonetrek. No bodies were found onboard, though there were
    clear signs of a sustained firefight. Heth\u2019s bloodied Caldari Constructions
    Employee of the Month watch was recovered at the scene.\n\n### Admiral Yakiya
    Tovil-Toba\n\nOne of the most famous Caldari military officers to ever serve in
    the Caldari Navy, Tovil-Toba was an admiral during the First Gallente-Caldari
    War. He piloted the first-ever fighter carrier, the Kairiola, during the most
    pivotal battle of the entire war. Initially a water freighter, the Kairiola was
    refitted to act as a fighter carrier during the orbital bombardment of Caldari
    Prime, and Tovil-Toba was selected to pilot it due to his commendable leadership
    ability and his outstanding piloting skill.\n\nBoth the Kairiola and Tovil-Toba
    are well known for a weeklong run of relentless guerrilla fleet actions against
    the Gallente home fleet shortly after the start of Caldari Prime\u2019s evacuation.
    The most famous part of this operation was its culmination, in which the admiral
    ordered all nonessential personnel to abandon ship, before sacrificing himself
    and flying the heavily damaged carrier into the atmosphere of Gallente Prime,
    where it broke up on entry and struck several areas of the city of Hueromont,
    resulting in the deaths of over two million Gallente. The resulting diversion
    of Gallente forces from the frontlines to assist in aiding the city enabled the
    Caldari to successfully complete their evacuation of the Caldari people from their
    besieged home planet.\n\nTo this day Tovil-Toba is revered as one of the greatest
    heroes in the history of the Caldari State, and traditionally, his name is the
    first phrase that every Caldari child learns.\n\n### Admiral Visera Yanala\n\nIn
    service of the Caldari State for eighty-four years, Admiral Visera Yanala was
    one of the longest-serving and most respected officers in the Caldari Navy at
    the time of her death on March 22, YC 115.\n\nBorn on Caldari Prime before relocating
    to Kisogo VIII in her early years, Yanala shied away from the limelight for most
    of her career. She rose to prominence when she was drafted out of retirement to
    reassume command of the Caldari Navy titan Shiigeru in March YC 115, during the
    tensions which served as a preamble to the eventual assault on Caldari Prime by
    the Federation Navy. Having served as captain of the Shiigeru for two decades
    before her retirement, she reassumed command under direct orders from Tibus Heth,
    who was attempting to stabilize the situation.\n\nExact details of the events
    surrounding the destruction of the Shiigeru still remain unclear to the public.
    It is known that Yanala was initially demonized by both Heth and the Caldari Providence
    Directorate before an investigation was ordered by the Chief Executive Panel to
    assess the loss of the vessel. Yanala was then vindicated and declared a national
    hero after it was revealed that she had refused to obey no less than seven direct
    orders from Tibus Heth to fire the Oblivion-class doomsday weapon fitted to the
    Shiigeru directly at Caldari Prime in order to halt the attack\u2014an act which
    would have resulted in hundreds of millions of innocent casualties.\n\nDuring
    the investigation, it was further revealed to an astonished investigatory board
    that Yanala had jettisoned the vessel\u2019s magazines, which were packed with
    citadel torpedoes, into the planet\u2019s atmosphere to allow them to harmlessly
    burn up. She also shut down all volatile systems onboard the vessel as it began
    to fall from orbit and break up. It later came to light that on reawakening from
    her subsequent capsule loss after the destruction of Shiigeru, she was forced
    by Heth to commit ritual suicide for disobeying his orders. The revelation of
    the real cause of her death, after both Tibus Heth and the Caldari Providence
    Directorate had attempted to cover it up, sent shock waves through the Caldari
    State that further contributed to his eventual removal from office."
