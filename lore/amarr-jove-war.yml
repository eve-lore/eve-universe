    as well as adding the Jovians to the Empire's [slave stock](slavery). The Empire
    broadcast its intentions to invade the Jove for weeks before they actually did.
    In addition to the Empire underestimating the technological superiority of the
    Jove, the Jovians managed to obtain the Empire's battle plans. The Empire was
    crushingly defeated in the Battle of Vak'Atioth, the war's first and only major
    conflict. \n\nAfter coming to grips with the defeat, the Empire planned to invade
    a second time with a larger, more well prepared fleet. However, the [Minmatar
    Rebellion](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N) occurred and disrupted those plans. Faced with
    an external war and an internal rebellion, the Empire sued for peace with the
    Jove. The Jove, unwilling to fight in a protracted war, agreed to the peace and
    left the Empire alone.\n\nThe lopsided victory for the Jove in the war became
    well-known throughout the cluster and has served as an effective deterrence against
    invasion from any other force. \n\n\n### See Also\n* [Battle of Vak'Atioth](1Cq1o1feVsJi6HuaVZs1L4)"
