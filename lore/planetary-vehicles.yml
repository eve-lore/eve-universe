    designed to work on a planet, in contrast to spaceships or\nstation vehicles.
    In common parlance, the term planetary vehicle usually\nrefers specifically to
    high-tech, personal transports, though the term\ncan also be applied to antiques
    such as airplanes and automobiles.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nPlanetary vehicles have
    been independently developed by virtually ever\ncivilization in [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk).
    Their\ndevelopment tends to coincide with the development of the steam engine,\nwith
    early models typically being large vehicles used for commercial or\nindustrial
    work. From there, planetary vehicles diverged depending on\nlocal customs and
    resource availability. On planets such as [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i),
    which lacked large scale fossil fuel\nresources, steam engines continued to be
    the primary power source until\nhigh-power electrical engines were developed.
    Conversely, on [Gallente Prime](41JbD6M3Keq024T44ULv7a), the abundance of fossil
    fuels allowed\nfor the utilization of internal combustion engines.\n\nEarly models
    of planetary vehicles took many disparate forms, though all\nhad a few components
    in common; wheels, a steering mechanism, and a\nbraking mechanism. Four-wheeled
    models proved the most popular on most\nplanets, though two-, three-, and six-or-more-wheeled
    devices all filled\na variety of niches and functions depending on local conditions
    and\nneeds. In the early days, the vehicles were dangerous to both passengers\nand
    pedestrians. Safety improvements were perhaps the driving force\nbehind many innovations
    in design.\n\nAs technology advanced, planetary vehicles only changed slightly.
    Most\nchanges went toward making the vehicles more energy efficient, safer,\nand
    cheaper for the consumer. A major innovation was the development of\n[hover technology](4VDHQyfA7oKLZmtQ90lJNb),
    typically through\nelectromagnetism or gravity manipulation. No large-scale changes
    to\nvehicular design have emerged since, with most alterations being done\nfor
    stylistic reasons.\n\nAvailability\n------------\n\nPlanetary vehicles are available
    on virtually all planets with\npopulations of note. Remote settlements, however,
    must often rely on\nimported vehicles from off-world, increasing their cost and
    limiting\ntheir market. These planets tend to utilize older models of vehicle,\nwith
    only the core regions having access to the latest models.\n\nBecause there exist
    a wide variety of inhabited planets in New Eden, a\nlarge number of different
    models of planetary vehicle have been\ndeveloped. The most widespread are, of
    course, models designed to work\non a terrestrial planet with a nitrogen-oxygen
    atmosphere of roughly one\nbar pressure. However, models for use on atmosphereless
    barrens, ocean\nworlds, storm planets, and even gas giants exist. The more unusual
    the\nplanet, the more expensive the model is; a vehicle that can operate on a\nplasma
    planet with a methane-dominated atmosphere could cost several\ndozen times the
    amount a standard vehicle might.\n\nWheeled vehicles remain the most widespread
    designs, owing to their\nsimplicity, relative safety, and affordability. Most
    consumers have\nlittle need for the added maneuverability of hover vehicles, while\ntracked
    vehicles tend to only see use in extremely rugged terrain. Hover\nvehicles, however,
    are widely popular among the more well-off; budget\nmodels are affordable for
    upper-middle class families and those\nlower-middle class families who don't mind
    paying off long-term loans.\n\nCultural Impact\n---------------\n\nLearning to
    drive a planetary vehicle is typically seen as a rite of\npassage for teenagers
    in most cultures of New Eden. Regulations vary\nfrom planet to planet, though
    most limit legal operation of planetary\nvehicles to those in their late teens
    who have passed driving tests and\nattained a license. More wealthy communities
    often couple this rite with\nthe purchase of a child's first vehicle of his own,
    while those from\npoorer areas must often make due with sharing a family vehicle.\n\nThe
    latest models of vehicle are often glamorized in holovids. This has\nled to the
    popular perception from outsiders that every Gallente owned\ntheir own hover vehicle,
    as blockbuster vids almost exclusively featured\nthem. The connection of stylish,
    luxurious automobiles has been so\nfirmly tied with the Gallente that luxury vehicles
    are often referred to\nas \"Gallente\" even if they are manufactured by non-Gallente\ncompanies.\n\nManufacture\n-----------\n\nNumerous
    companies manufacture planetary vehicles. Most are limited in\nscope to the single
    planet they operate on, or perhaps a single solar\nsystem. Manufacturers that
    cater to an interstellar market typically\ntarget only the high-end consumer,
    producing luxury vehicles. Among the\nmost successful luxury manufacturers are\n[NOH](4Ykng1Buej1uH3Sy5ln3jW),
    \n[Noble Appliances](1LELInZwtDNM4IZ7Nh0OZz), and \n[Quafe](ssPYMESgTyz1rl4fTojD6).\n\nMore
    recently, [capsuleers](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) have entered the\nplanetary vehicle
    market, utilizing their development of planetary\nresources. Because of the limited
    use of planetary vehicles to the\nspace-based capsuleers, creation of these vehicles
    tends to be done\nmainly as a sort of hobby. Reaction to the quality of these
    vehicles\nthroughout the industry has been mixed.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n-   [Transportation
