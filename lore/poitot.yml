    the decades that followed first contact with the [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK),
    the [Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn) were quick to take to the stars, reaching
    out to neighboring systems and establishing colonies.\n\nShortly before the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy)
    secession from the Gallente Federation, and the war that followed, the Intaki
    began to move into a new region of space which had previously been left unexplored.
    The growing network of jump gates was expanded into the region, and the first
    pioneers began to establish planetary settlements in the star systems they had
    reached.\n\nThe Intaki named the first constellation they reached \u201CPoitot\u201D,
    in honor of the notable Idama and astronomer Isana en Poitot who had been the
    first to comprehensively chart those stars and constellations in the night sky.\n\nWar
    and Reprisals\n----------\n\nLater, during the [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV),
    the development of frontier colonies stalled, and the small Poitot settlements
    were largely forgotten.\n\nIn Placid, some Intaki called out against the conflict,
    or joined the Caldari in their fight against the Gallente, while others called
    for their own independence from the Federation.\n\nThe mixed outcry would later
    become known as the Intaki Uprising, and it did not go unpunished by the Gallente
    Federation.\n\nIn the final years of the Gallente-Caldari War,  the Ultra-Nationalist
    government began to turn its attention inwards, with a view to deal with those
    who had spoken out. Reprisals were swift and severe.\n\nPresident Duvalier ordered
    the arrest of thousands, labelling them political dissidents and a risk to the
    stability of the post-war Federation. Peaceful activists were rounded up alongside
    separatist rebels and violent criminals alike.\n\nDuvalier wanted them all to
    disappear, but was reluctant to execute them and turn them into martyrs. Instead,
    he planned for the detainees to be removed from sight and exiled to the fringes
    of the Federation. He selected the bordering systems of the Poitot constellation
    as their destination.\n\nA small Navy task force was sent ahead of the exile fleet
    with orders to raze every settlement to the ground, condemning the prisoners aboard
    their own ships.\n\nShortly after the Navy had jumped back to Placid, explosions
    rocked the jump gate's superstructure causing irreparable damage.\n\nDuvalier's
    final act of spite had been to order the sabotage of the constellation jump gate
    to the Intaki system. The gate on the Placid side was slowly redirected, effectively
    slamming the door behind the exiles' backs. The Federation redrew the galactic
    map and deleted the names of the constellation and its colonies from the records.\n\nRebuilding\n----------\n\nBeyond
    the Federal border and out of sight, the exiled flotilla of repurposed cargo haulers,
    civilian shuttles and surviving colonist prospecting ships gathered at the jump
    gate wreckage. Over time the ruined structure began to disappear as it was taken
    apart and salvaged. The largest surviving section of the structure was relocated
    to the fifth planet, where it became the core of the first free station, of what
    would later develop into the [Intaki Syndicate](5aCxBhwo0vxK42kDWY4vKJ).\n\nAs
    the exiles built their new home in space, they renamed the system Poitot, in memory
    of the first constellation colonies they had lost.\n\nSuch was its significance,
    they would not name another system in the region.\n\nPresent Day\n----------\n\nTwo
    major Syndicate organisations have their corporate headquarters in the Poitot
    system.\n\nThe Intaki Syndicate corporation offices are found aboard the the bureau
    station run by the infamous [en-Diabel family](4BJ0d6egqu6OsvXHQ0ah5u). Close
    by, the Intaki Space Police headquarters also act as an assembly plant, ensuring
    their forces are constantly supplied with new ships and equipment.\n\nThe presence
    of these two important stations, and the system\u2019s historical significance,
    means Poitot is the de facto capital system of the Intaki Syndicate.\n\nTrivia\n----------\n\nPoitot
    is the only named system in The Syndicate.\n\nSee Also\n----------\n\n[Chronicle:
