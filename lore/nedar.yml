    military arm. He was in charge of a squad of ships sent to defend a

    facility from a [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ). He schemed his way

    into higher ranks with this assault, stabbing [Eron](2oerAPXY5ZCtPcwF08xdGL),

    one of his own people, in the back by faking sabotage on his own ship to

    incite his own second in command, [Raze](2KvOppq2d1krzm2OT8z6I2), to sabotage

    Eron''s ship, in turn causing his death against the capsuleer. His wife,

    [Scyldie](1moM3qDMYNHJULkvJkZ0Zr), was meeting with the Furies around the

    time of the capsuleer assault to discuss gaining entry to their ranks to

    increase their combined power. Nedar had been having an affair of

    convenience with a woman named [Aredia](7thNOgsrbTydOtSp7ooWs) to further

    his own goal.
