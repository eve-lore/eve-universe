- body: '**CD-1** is the call sign of the [CreoDron](3lCriaLYr0Nrmj9pkru5Z3) Flagship.
    To most observers this ship would be a monstrosity. Horrifically warped Dominix
    hulls over-flowing with esoteric electronics equipment evocative of the spikes
    on [Sansha](6dFZYDkE3R4BRF9w21mtjP) vessels, it is nonetheless the beloved ''mothership''
    of CreoDron scientists, filling the dual roles of mobile research lab and as a
    home. It is a sign of the importance of the Vitrauze project that the choice was
    made to use it as a decoy to distract the [Black Eagles](6eVk3icIk4UHf5Uh799xDN),
    knowing it would be confiscated by the [Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK).
