    ability to declare an emergency, during which period\nhe is granted complete executive
    control. However, the Tribal\nCouncil can vote by simple majority to end the emergency
    at\nany time, and when they do so, the Sanmatar is removed from\noffice, unless
    the council votes by two-thirds majority to retain\nthe current Sanmatar.\n\nSee
