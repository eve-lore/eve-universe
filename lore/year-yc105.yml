- body: "May\n---\n\nA dramatic increase in space\ntravelers within regions traditionally
    associated with pirates lead the\n[DED](1xZoOUsqaDhJw7gQffHMFC) to instigate and
    enforce new directives in\ninterstellar law enforcement. This marked the beginning
    of the DED's\n(and [CONCORD's](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt)) controversial and secretive
    chain\nof operations through the first part of the year. The four empires ran\ninto
    problems with independent \"rogue miners,\" who were harvesting\nasteroid belts
    previously staked for the empires' use. These\ndifficulties were addressed with
    increased cooperation between CONCORD\nand empire navies, but by the time this
    arrangement was established much\nof the rare ore had been harvested already.
    Sad times for the\nempires' coffers, but lucrative ones for\nthe freelancers.\n\nJune\n----\n\n
    Early in June, the\n[SCC](7v1HmgfP9wx45IXYZCbWbK) briefly stepped into the\ninterstellar
    media spotlight by mediating the long-standing\ndisagreements between academics
    of all stripes and the manufacturers of\nthe skill packs their work was put into.
    This dispute, dubbed by pundits\n\"the Second [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV)\"
    due\nto the nationalities of the corporations and schools most vocal in the\ndispute
    (the [CBD Corporation](7o6AuVZhnq4lIzIMdYdMft) and the\n[University of Caille](3yrFWFSjOxnFu1GTFhudTM)),
    had escalated\ninto an all-out strike which cut off the availability of skill
    packs in\nmost colonized regions of the universe. Twenty-four hours later, the
    SCC\nhad agreed upon emergency legislation which re-established order in the\nmarketplace,
    and were hailed as saviors by starving academics and\nstarship pilots alike\n\nJune
    also saw the emergence of a new breed of terrorist, one without\napparent political
    aims. Early in the month, CONCORD issued a travel\nwarning to all those passing
    through the Obe system, stating that\n\"unknown marauders\" had been preying on
    innocent traders. This was only\nthe first of many outbreaks of lawlessness within
    empire borders, and\nCONCORD found itself forced to deploy Special Ops units to
    keep the\nmarauders at bay. Throughout the month, much speculation surrounded
    the\nmethods CONCORD would utilize to stem this crime tide, most of which\nwere
    neither disclosed to press nor public, but which would prove\nextremely effective.
    CONCORD's first step in this direction was the\npublishing of the first interstellar
    Most Wanted List, which was\ninitially topped by the infamous marauder Lord Zap.\n\nOn
    the 26th of June citizens of the empires celebrated the First Contact\nFestival
    marking the 105th anniversary of the Yoiul Conference, that\nhistoric meeting
    of minds where the guidelines for Trans-Empire peace\nand cooperation were originally
    set. First Contact Festivals are a time\nof chaotic revelry and this year's was
    no exception, as whole systems\nshut down their commercial operations and gave
    themselves to the\ncelebration.\n\nJuly\n----\n\n At the beginning of July\nCONCORD
    pulled two aces out of its sleeve: we saw the arrival of the new\nsuperhighway
    system they had been touting for months previously, and we\nsuddenly saw automated
    armaments at every empire [jump gate](416pCzXGIwn2Tt7feZYSpk) we went to. The
    new spacelanes, combined\nwith CONCORD's increased presence and subsequent quelling
    of the crime\ntide, ushered in an era of tremendous economic growth. The robotics\nindustry
    alone reported an almost 200% increase in revenue over the\ncourse of the next
    months, as independent traders and corporations alike\nwere able to take to their
    business without fear for their lives.\n\nAround the middle of the month, news
    leaked from the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) that negotiations
    for a major research\npact between the Federation and the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy)\nwere
    underway. Initially neither side could be reached for confirmation\nbut as the
    days passed and the world watched, more rumors circulated and\nmore details came
    to light. On the 27th of the month, the two\ngovernments released a joint statement
    announcing the existence of the\n[Crielere Research Laboratories](3Y34ZySL2hebLjco1Y25IK),
    a cooperative project\ninvolving some of the two empires' best scientific minds.
    The project\nwas hailed by many as a triumph for Gallente-Caldari relations, and\ndescribed
    by analysts as \"a milestone to remember for these two former\nenemies.\"\n\nThis
    month also saw [Amarr Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) [Heideran VII](4Olxc4nxWd7y1mjFPhvHnV)
    as the surprise recipient of the [Aidonis Foundation's award](2ZdUwi6lEN75YZoamvXA72)
    for his contributions to\ninter-stellar peace and improved empire relations. The
    announcement came\nas a shock to many, even prompting violent attacks from\n[Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp)
    rebel factions, but most political\nanalysts agreed that Heideran was well deserving
    of the award, citing\nhis tireless efforts to thaw out the icy walls built between
    Amarr and\nthe other empires over the last centuries and temper the aggressive\ntendencies
    of his massive nation.\n\nAugust\n------\n\n In August the universe was held in\nrapt
    attention as news filtered out that a [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G)\nadmiral
    named [Ouria](2Og5aR1ZiiVEYPgx9FJcPg) had gone rogue after giving away\na high-technology
    item to a non-Jove, thus violating the\nnon-interference law imposed by the Jove
    directorate upon all its\nsubjects. Ouria's defection was discovered when word
    spread of a secret\nmeeting taking place somewhere in the Stain region of space
    between a\ngroup of Jove and an unknown party. During this meeting, an\n[Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
    pilot who had been determined to investigate\nthe proceedings was shot down by
    Jove ships, sparking a diplomatic\nincident between the two empires. Following
    this, the Jove released the\ninformation that Admiral Ouria had been stricken
    with the deadly\npsychological disorder known as the [Jovian Disease](23mdEc1035XOWRcmorPJYf)
    and declared him an exile from the\nJove Empire, disavowing responsibility and
    denouncing his actions.\nCONCORD went one step further, placing a 100 million
    ISK bounty on his\nhead.\n\nReports continued to resurface sporadically from the
    Stain region, where\nOuria's renegade band was rumored to be scouting around for
    territories\nto set up operations in. Their attempts were met with sustained\nresistance
    from the corporations of the Stain Alliance and after one\nparticularly bloody
    and decisive battle, Ouria managed to escape into\nhiding. A few days later, information
    came to light that Ouria had\ndeveloped ties with the infamous Minmatar rebel
    faction Oracle and\nrumors circled that he was in talks with them about an alliance.
    After\nmanaging to intercept communications between Ouria and one of his\nbrothers,
    CONCORD was able to issue a general warning for the sectors of\nStain space where
    the Admiral was believed to be located. Following this\nnarrowing of the field,
    a massive fleet of Stain Alliance ships tracked\ndown and engaged Ouria and his
    contingent of Oracle soldiers, defeating\nthe Jovian and his Minmatar cohorts
    after a long and bloody struggle.\n\nAlso in August, Amarr-Minmatar relations
    took a drastic turn for the\nworse when an Amarr ambassador was shot down by a
    squadron of Minmatar\nrebels on his way into [Ammatar](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz)
    space. The motives\nfor the attack became clear when it was revealed that the
    ambassador had\nbeen carrying top-secret intelligence documents intended for the\n[Ammatar
    Consulate](LxRVvJ2TIDlhoEWiTfKF2), detailing the names\nand locations of known
    Minmatar rebel leaders, their bases and defenses.\nIt was believed this was to
    have been the first step by the Amarr\ntowards quelling the rising tide of Minmatar
    incursions into Ammatar\nspace by applying tactical strikes to key rebel targets.
    Following the\nincident a familiar dance played itself out between the two nations:
    the\nMinmatar Republic deplored the raid whilst denying any knowledge of it,\nand
    the Amarr Empire countered that the Republic's inability to control\ntheir own
    people was inexcusable, clearly placing the responsibility in\nthe Republic's
    hands.\n\nAran'gar of the Bleak Cabal, one of the raiders involved in the attack,\nwhen
    interviewed from an undisclosed location somewhere inside Minmatar\nspace, released
    a statement characteristic to the climate of increasing\nhostility the next months
    would bring: \"My duty is to save those who are\nenslaved. I do not expect the
    Amarr to understand this, but as long as\nthey keep innocent people as slaves
    their citizens will suffer my\nwrath.\"\n\nSeptember\n---------\n\n September
    saw what was perhaps the year's\ngreatest single shift in the interstellar political
    climate: the passing\nof Amarr Emperor Heideran VII. Following announcements earlier
    in the\nmonth that the Emperor had fallen ill, and subsequent expressions of\nconcern
    from world leaders and massive vigils held by the Emperor's\nloyal subjects, on
    the 17th it was declared that Heideran VII had\ndeparted this mortal coil. The
    news sent shockwaves reverberating\nthroughout the four empires, resulting in
    record instability of markets\nand universal uncertainty over what the future
    would hold. In response\nthe Amarr Imperial Succession Committee went to work
    right away, setting\nin motion plans for the [Amarr Imperial Championship](1wt48mKlJG23uoZhpmxNzx),
    an event that would decide\nwhich of the five ruling houses' heirs would succeed
    Heideran to the\nthrone. Details of this Championship were leaked from the committee
    late\nin the month, revealing that the Champions - combat pilots who would\nget
    the chance to compete, one for each house, alongside three wingmen\nin closed
    frigate battles -- were to be selected via a popular vote, as\na gesture of commitment
    to the departed emperor's legacy of honoring the\ntraditions of other nations.
    This enraged various fundamentalist\nfactions within Amarr, most notably [Jamyl
    Sarum](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L), who released a scathing public statement\ndenouncing
    the decision as \"heretical.\"\n\nMore fighting took place between Amarr and Minmatar
    pilots after a ship\ncarrying several hundred freed slave children was attacked
    and destroyed\nen route to Minmatar space, where they were to have started new
    lives\namong relatives in the Republic. Investigations into the atrocity\nrevealed
    that a small fanatical Amarr religious cult named\n[Tetrimon](4Z9IYnlIENaSBblXROhEfY)
    (\"Divine Devotion\") had\nbeen responsible. Amid cries for blood from outraged
    Minmatar\neverywhere, a squad of fierce Minmatar warriors tracked down and killed\ntwo
    of the cult's high priestesses. The cult has not been heard from\nsince, though
    a number of its members are believed to be still at large.\n\nOctober\n-------\n\n
    October was the month of\nthe Amarr Championships. Throughout the month, cunning
    commanders and\ntheir fearless wingmen swooped through the Amarr skies, each championing\ntheir
    cause in the most literal way imaginable. The Empire watched\nraptly as the Champions,
    through their actions, determined the course of\ntheir collective future. After
    a series of thrilling matches which\nspanned the course of two weeks and featured
    some of the finest tactics\never seen on a battlefield, only one Champion stood
    left: Ecliptical,\nChampion of the [House of Kor-Azor](1S0FEGgzJiwc4yXaG5AzjD).\n\nIn
    October we also saw the first seedlings of the Protein Delicacies\nfiasco take
    root. Late in the month, the [Sukuuvestaa Corporation](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB)
    released the by-now\ninfamous line of food products, hailed as revolutionary at
    the time due\nto their low price, great flavor and incredible production efficiency.\nThe
    Gallente Federation's Department of Education didn't take long to\nsee the economic
    benefits, and within days had signed a deal with the\nSukuuvestaa Corporation
    to supply all Gallente schools with the new\nwonder food, which would save the
    Department billions of ISK that could\nbe used for reforms elsewhere in the education
    system.\n\nNovember\n--------\n\n During the last days of October and\nthroughout
    the beginning of November reports began to come in of\ndecreasing test scores
    within the Gallente school system, as well as an\nincrease in student truancy
    and disciplinary problems. An investigative\ncommittee was assembled to search
    for the reasons behind this sudden\ndrop, but made little headway initially. A
    few days later, the [Quafe Company](ssPYMESgTyz1rl4fTojD6) suddenly released information
    that\nproved beyond doubt that the main ingredients in the Protein Delicacies\nwere
    in fact organic waste, processed station sewage and second grade\nbiomass. The
    Caldari State's [Chief Executive Panel](5OC2T1uqCSy4NUPhhpq9Xr) was quick to respond,
    promising\nthat an investigation would be undertaken to determine whether there
    was\ncause for further action in the matter.\n\nSome days later, the Gallente
    Federal [Senate](x8brOPuT22Bcly2Sikkt5) lodged\na formal inquiry as to how the
    Sukuuvestaa Corporation had managed to\nconceal the dubious origin of their food
    product from health boards and\nother agencies. At about the same time, the Suukuvestaa
    Corporation\nsuddenly released a statement on the issue, denouncing the Quafe\nCompany's
    \"deplorable\" industrial espionage and accusing the popular\nsoft-drink manufacturer
    of having intended to steal the manufacturing\nprocess for the Protein Delicacies.
    Interestingly, the Suukuvestaa\nstatement made no mention whatsoever of the delicacies'
    unsavory\ncontents, a clear indicator to some that they were apathetic to the\nsituation.\n\nIt
    was about this time that the Gallente investigative committee\ndelivered their
    findings: apparently, studies indicated a clear link\nbetween consumption of Protein
    Delicacies and decreasing cognitive\nability. This prompted a moral outcry from
    the Federation's citizens, as\nwell as a formal request from the Federation to
    the Caldari State\ndemanding indemnities for the selling of the contaminated products.
    The\nChief Executive Panel convened for the decision, and two days later\nreleased
    a statement saying that \"The business practices employed in the\nmanufacturing
    and marketing of the Protein Delicacies were not\nsignificantly different from
    what normally takes place in a capitalistic\neconomy, and there is unsatisfactory
    evidence to suggest any deliberate\nfoul play at work.\"\n\nThis prompted an uproar
    within the Federation Senate, many senators\ntaking extreme stances and some even
    going as far as to suggest a\nrenewal of the war. The [President](UW2GqozmvYnsm1kRPpp1E)
    and the\nFederal Cabinet were less outspoken on the matter, but persistent rumors\ncirculated
    that [President Foiritan](37ecuyyUNrWqNAzxwC5Wbt) was\ndeliberating on some ways
    to \"get back\" at the Caldari. Whether or not\nthis is true has not become clear
    yet, but one thing remains certain:\nGallente-Caldari relations, which had been
    steadily improving over the\npast years, have with this incident taken their biggest
    single downturn\nsince the war between the two nations still raged.\n\nNovember
    also saw the award ceremony for the Championships, and later\nthe historic inauguration
    of the new Amarr Emperor, [Doriam Kor-Azor](1aaBMbCysLA8uJjQQczFwT). The ceremony
    was held at the end of the\nmonth at an undisclosed location, and was described
    by some as the most\ntense moment in modern Amarr history. It began, as all Amarr\ninauguration
    ceremonies have begun throughout the ages, with the ritual\nsuicide -- or [Shathol'Syn](7uCmeRGL3bgVWlEWQ9TZQb)
    -- of the contending\nhouses' heirs. Just as it was Jamyl Sarum's turn to end
    her life,\nhowever, warships from the [Sarum](4EZ4a3Mw8QXHmisAA4Ff6L) fleet\ninterrupted
    the ceremony, launching missiles at Kor-Azor's ship. Sarum\nordered them off,
    and immediately thereafter prematurely performed the\nShathol'Syn without naming
    an [heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) to her\ndynasty, thus leaving her estate essentially
    headless. Despite this\njarring event the ceremony continued as planned, with
    Kor-Azor\ndelivering a rousing speech where he stated his intentions to bring\npeace
    and prosperity through negotiations and goodwill. The ceremony was\nconcluded
    without incident.\n\nDecember\n--------\n\n The first half of\nDecember saw life
    returning to normal for most of the world's\ninhabitants. With a new emperor on
    the throne of the largest nation in\nthe universe, the uncertainty that had plagued
    many people's lives over\nthe last few months had abated and the economy had re-stabilized
    itself.\nDoriam Kor-Azor had begun his rule, and was already making waves in the\ninterstellar
    political arena with moves that analysts touted as \"just\ngood politics, plain
    and simple.\" One notable incident concerned the\nfleet of now-headless superpower
    House Sarum; on the 11th of the month\nseveral squadrons massed at [Sarum Prime](uO7T7UMc6L0S8OUcHJJqP),\nprompting
    CONCORD to increase their own presence in the system, bumping\nit up to a new
    level of security. At first speculations ran rampant\nregarding what the Sarum
    fleet was up to with this massive consolidation\nof forces, but no indication
    has been given of any movement from Sarum\nPrime as of yet.\n\nIn the latter half
    of December, we experienced the beginning of what may\nbe the greatest technological
    leap of the decade when the Crielere\nproject's technological advances were unveiled
    and made freely available\nto the public. The announcement came from [Otro Gariushi](5QydCJCoYvbvbWvFlAlbHg),
    the CEO of [Ishukone Corporation](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI), amidst much public
    doubt\nand speculation - why were the Gallente and the Caldari sharing the\nresults
    of their research so freely? Whatever the answer, the world's\nnations haven't
    been resting on their laurels; a great deal of Minmatar\n[Brutor](5xBrtZyeYfTxWkZTO1o5zg)
    have been overtly clamoring for a war\neffort against the Amarr, reportedly confident
    that the new technology\ngives them just the edge they needed to strike at the
    heart of the\ngiant. The [Sebiestor Tribe](1fNour0sFTIcCFRVQM2pro), however,\nhaven't
    been quite so quick on the trigger and have tried their best to\ntone down their
    brothers' rough-hewn rhetoric. Nevertheless, the rumor\nmill churns away merrily
    with all sorts of tales of underground war\nefforts being supported by high-ranking
    government agencies within the\nMinmatar Republic."
