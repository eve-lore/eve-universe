- body: "Mordu's Legion is a [minor faction](minor-factions) in\n[New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk).
    It was formed by military\nmastermind [Muryia Mordu](1V7T2MMuQi8OZQi7QQlTpV) after
    the Waschi\nUprising, when he took many of his disenfranchised, former\n[Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn)
    troops - who had been persecuted on [Kamokor IV](yOVXgfGWF8UUaMX1vPAlK)\nby nationalists
    - under his wing. Their first\naction involved putting down the same uprising.
    They performed this task\nquickly and efficiently, establishing a trustworthy
    reputation that has\nremained to this very day.\n\nInitial Founding\n----------------\n\nTowards
    the end of the first [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV)\nmany [Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn),\nwho
    sympathized with the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) side of the\nfight, were
    exiled from the [Gallente Federation](Gallente-Federation).\nThey, alongside others
    who\ndefected, approached the Caldari and stated their willingness to take up\narms
    against the Federation. Many of these men and women were trained\nsoldiers and
    brought a wealth of expertise with them that the Caldari\nmilitary forces were
    keen to exploit. So as not to cause a loss of\ncohesion among their existing units,
    aware of potential cultural\ndifferences between Caldari and Intaki, they elected
    to form a single\nunit with the defectors rather than spreading them out among
    existing\nbranches of the Caldari military. They placed this unit under the\ncommand
    of Brigadier General [Muryia Mordu](1V7T2MMuQi8OZQi7QQlTpV),\nknown for his tactical
    acumen. By the end of the war the achievements of\nthe unit, still mostly made
    up of Intaki troops, were hailed as nothing\nshort of modern military legend.
    \n\nFollowing the end of the war, which had lasted almost a century, the\nIntaki
    were invited to stay in Caldari society and granted accommodation\nin Waschi City
    on [Kamokor IV](yOVXgfGWF8UUaMX1vPAlK). Over the years\nthat followed a nationalist
    movement took root on the planet, centered\non this city specifically due to the
    proportionally large presence of\nthe Intaki residents. Many were the subject
    of victimization and\nxenophobic attacks, incidents that began to go unchecked
    by local\nauthorities as well. Eventually a full-blown uprising against the\nCaldari
    government began when Caldari authorities attempted to bring the\ncity to order,
    having descended into almost daily violence.\n\nDuring this uprising the Intaki
    who served in the war sought the help of\ntheir former commanding officer. Muryia
    Mordu responded, having recently\nretired from the navy, and took steps to reform
    his old fighting force.\nHowever, this was complicated by the fact that none of
    them were\nofficially serving in the military anymore, placing them in a difficult\nsituation
    in terms of fighting back against the uprising. Mordu formed\nthe fighting force
    under a mercenary banner, calling themselves Mordu's\nLegion and assisted the
    Caldari in dismantling the uprising, which they\ndid with calculated efficiency
    under Mordu's leadership.\n\nFollowing the Waschi uprising, the [Caldari Navy](caldari-navy)\noffered
    Mordu's Legion an official\nstation within the navy itself. Mordu turned down
    this offer, and\nmaintained his leadership over his new mercenary force which
    operates to\nthis day in New Eden as one of the most venerated and effective\nfreelance
    military contractors.\n\n### Caldari Ties\n\nThe Legion retains close ties with
    the [Caldari State](Caldari-State),\nand its leadership remains Caldari,\nthough
    members of all races are welcomed in its ranks, so long as they\nare not known
    enemies of the State. The State allows the Legion access\nto high-end Caldari
    military gear, and long-serving members of the\nLegion who are not State citizens
    are commonly offered Caldari\ncitizenship upon retirement.\n\nThe Legion has set
    up home in [Pure Blind](Pure-Blind-Region)\nand now operates as a\nprofessional
    mercenary outfit. While the loss of their long-standing\ncontract with [ORE](ore)
    during the latter's recent hostile\ntakeover by the [Serpentis](Serpentis) was
    a blow, Mordu's\nLegion is still very much a force to be reckoned with. It is
    a notable\nfeature of their professionalism that the Legion does not perform\ntraining
    tasks itself, expecting new recruits to have prior combat\nexperience.\n\nMordu's
    Legion in the Empyrean Age\n----------------------------------\n\nSince the dawn
    of what is widely referred to as [The Empyrean Age](1F44OHn6oM10NfmzPlrSrr), when\n[capsule](Capsule-lore)
    technology became available for\nprivate individuals spawning a large surge of
    capsuleer pilots across\nNew Eden, Mordu's Legion has both endured the assaults
    of the\n[capsuleers](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) and secured stronger ties with major\nempires.
    They have changed the face of their activities with the Caldari\nState and Gallente
    Federation, acting as peacekeepers both in the\n[Intaki system](17xNygfKnuI4d0t0JHAU0Z)
    as well as on [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i).\n\nThe Legion has also
    gained several new technological advances over\nrecent years, resulting from their
    new-found partnerships and giving\nbirth to several new ships in their arsenal.\n\n###
    Legion Under Fire\n\nDespite the good standings with the Caldari State, other
    empires\ncontinually find themselves and their operations at odds with Mordu's\nLegion
    activities. Being a mercenary organization at their core has not\nmade the Legion
    many friends. Even within the Caldari State itself their\nactivities are not exclusively
    beneficial to the State, and the Legion\nare contracted by minor criminal entities
    regularly to run interference\nand protection operations. Frequently, empire agents
    will contract\ncounter-operations targeted at not only the employers of the Legion,
    but\nalso Mordu's Legion itself.\n\nWith the rise of capsule technology spreading
    beyond the privilege of\nthe empires, many agents began to utilize the skills
    and capabilities of\ncapsuleer pilots to disrupt Legion activities. As Mordu's
    Legion itself\nlacks any major capsuleer capability at this point, they often
    come out\nof such conflicts on the losing end, although their recent entries into\nthe
    capsuleer-level spaceship race may indicate greater emphasis on\nluring capsuleers
    to their cause.\n\nFurther to this complication, [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt)
    has many\nblanket-issued bounties on different threat classifications of Mordu's\nLegion
    ships for capsuleer pilots to claim at will. As such they have\nchosen to maintain
    a smaller static presence in New Eden compared to\nother outlaw entities and pirate
    organizations. Instead their bases are\ntemporary, secreted away in dead space
    pockets, and their command and\norganizational structure is broken down into regional
    cells responsible\nfor their own local agendas.\n\n### ORE and Serpentis\n\nIn
    YC 106 Orion Mashel, the reclusive CEO of [Outer Ring Excavations](ore),\nwas
    reported to have had a personal and\nheated meeting with Muryia Mordu. The meeting
    attracted media attention\ngiven Mashel's recluse nature and being known for not
    accepting visitors\nat his headquarters . \n\nSeveral days later, Mordu's Legion
    was seen mobilizing on a large scale,\nreportedly under the direct command of
    Muryia Mordu himself. The\ntaskforce then penetrated deep into [Serpentis Corporation](serpentis-corporation)\nspace,
    avoiding all\nconflict with Serpentis forces as they orbited an installation in
    the\nheart of Serpentis territory and utilized an unknown device directed\nagainst
    a chemical storage facility. They then promptly left, no\nevident damage resulting,
    and were pursued by [Guardian Angel](guardian-angels)\nforces responding to the
    incursion.\nSeveral Legion ships were reported destroyed in running skirmishes\nthough
    Mordu himself and the bulk of his fleet returned to headquarters\nunharmed. \n\nIn
    an emergency meeting that followed, Mordu organized large scale\ndefensive pickets
    around ORE facilities to safeguard against further\nretaliation by Serpentis and
    their [Angel Cartel](3p6aB4GMbVdMUEVYOb3kF0)\nbacked security forces. Many other\nLegion
    forces were left marauding in the [Fountain](Fountain)\nregion, proving to be
    a thorn in the side of the Serpentis. A week later\nthe Serpentis and Cartel forces
    began a campaign to push the Legion\nforces out of Fountain, which eventually
    succeeded as Mordu yielded the\nfield.\n\nThis clandestine campaign prosecuted
    by the Legion unsettled many\nfactions including several prominent capsuleer alliances,
    all of whom\npublicly demanded answers from the Legion. However, none were\nforthcoming.\n\nFollowing
    this, tensions clearly rose between the Legion and ORE,\nleading to the opinion
    that the incursion into Serpentis space was\nagainst the wishes of Mashel, or
    that Mordu himself opposed the campaign\nand was pressured by ORE. Either way
    this campaign left a sour note in\nthe relations between the two corporations.
    Mordu's Legion eventually\nlost their contract with ORE as the Serpentis took
    a different approach\nto the conflict and announced their buyout of large portions
    of ORE\nshares. This put the Serpentis Corporation in a position of control\nover
    ORE policy, likely contributing to ORE's decision to revoke the\nMordu's Legion
    contract for protection. In exchange this buyout secured\nORE assets against further
    interference from Serpentis activities as\nwell as their allies among the Angel
    Cartel.\n\n### Intaki Prime and Ishukone\n\nDuring the long-standing Caldari occupation
    of the Gallente systems,\ndesignated as a contested zone under the [CONCORD Emergency
    Militia War Powers Act](39y03QDhd4N8GXwoV2zSha), in YC\n111 the [Caldari Providence
    Directorate](Caldari-Providence-Directorate) held a blind\nauction for the administration
    and development rights to the systems\nunder their control. Intaki was the\nonly
    system awarded to the [Ishukone Corporation](ishukone-corporation). In a deal
    with the\nMordu's Legion and the Intaki Assembly, both corporations moved in to\nprovide
    security and commercial shipping services to the planet's\ngoverning authority.\n\nThis
    was revealed to be a mutual business deal between Ishukone, the\nLegion and the
    Intaki Assembly, who retained rights under Gallente laws\nto franchise both services
    as they saw fit. Traditionally security\nwas franchised to the [Federation Navy](federation-navy)
    and\ncommercial shipping to [FedMart](fedmart).\n\nIshukone commercial ships,
    backed by Mordu's Legion military forces\narrived in orbit over the planet in
    March YC 112. Despite the auction\nresults having been announced the previous
    year, until this point no\nmovement had transpired on Ishukone's part. Furthermore,
    the system\ncontrol had been retaken by the [Federal Defense Union](Federal-Defence-Union)
    militia a week previous. The\nFDU were spurred to action over the reports and
    large conflicts took\nplace over the contested planet. This was followed by a
    plea from the\nIntaki Assembly for a cease fire, directed at the FDU, as they
    declared\nboth corporations to be \"present in Intaki at the specific and\nun-coerced
    request of the Assembly,\". Later that day the\nFederation Navy attempted to reassert
    control over the system by sending\na fleet under the control of Admiral Gouenette.
    The fleet was refused\nentry at the Intaki stargate in [Agoze](Agoze-System),
    and\nthe Intaki System Command informed the admiral they were \"neither\nrequired
    nor welcomed.\"\n\nWhile Ishukone are prohibited from sending any armed military
    ships to\noperate in Intaki, the Mordu's Legion are given full authority to police\nthe
    local space and were given full military access. This is entirely\nsubject to
    civilian oversight by the Intaki Assembly.\n\nEconomic and political analysts
    across New Eden have speculated on the\nspecifics of the deal between the three
    entities, mainly centered on\nIshukone and their financial capability or willingness
    to have hired the\nLegion forces as a system-wide security force. It was well
    known that\nthe Ishukone corporation's financial situation had taken a noticeable\ndecline
    under the rule of [Tibus Heth](6E1MZyo3l7DscBmmOdp7KG) and the\nnow dissolved
    Caldari Providence Directorate, still in power during\nthese events. It is possible
    that much of the potential expenditure was\ncovered by the securing of shipping
    and development franchise rights\nwith the Assembly itself, though much was left
    unanswered. There has\nalso been wild speculation that the [Intaki Syndicate](4ODncOn9Yvcol1oPLyHrFk)
    and the Mordu's Legion may have\ncome to a back room understanding allowing the
    Legion to make further\ninroads with security prospects with the organization.\n\n###
    Caldari Prime Peacekeeping\n\nFollowing the events of Operation Highlander, a
    concerted effort by the\nGallente Federation to retake [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i)\nfrom
    the Caldari State, the planet was declared\na demilitarized zone in a treaty by
    both sides. Following the\ndestruction on the planet during the conflict, caused
    mostly by the\nremains of the Leviathan class *Shiigeru* titan crashing to the
    surface,\n the administration of the planet was divided into two\ndistricts, Gallente
    and Caldari controlled. Soon afterwards, the Mordu's\nLegion announced their appointment
    as planetary security. \n\nThis deal was, again, brokered by the Ishukone corporation
    who stepped\nin to negotiate the terms of the ceasefire and the Caldari Prime
    Treaty\nthat followed. Having an already established relationship with the\nLegion
    due to their mutual role in the Intaki system, the Legion was\nseen by both sides
    of the conflict to be an ideal and already proven\nneutral solution to the question
    of security for the planet.\n\nMordu's Legion remains currently in complete control
    of the planet's\nsecurity coordination and have worked closely with the Ishukone\ncorporation
    in the Caldari district, and [Material Acquisition](material-acquisition) in the
    Gallente district.\nThe Legion also provides regular reports to the Caldari [Chief
    Executive Panel](5OC2T1uqCSy4NUPhhpq9Xr) and the Gallente\n[Senate](senate) for
    the sake of transparency.\n\nSince their appointment as security the Legion has
    received praise from\nboth administrations for their handling of the civilian
    populous. While\ncomplaints against the Legion have been made for some instances
    of\nheavy-handedness, overall no major incidents have arisen. Documented\ncases
    of the Legion successfully calming or neutralizing outbreaks of\nviolence state
    they have been both effective, and even-handed in their\nduties.\n\nResearch and
    Development Activities\n-----------------------------------\n\nIn YC 116 the Mordu's
    Legion reportedly fielded new ship designs in what\nseemed like shakedown cruises
    around their home region, as well as their\noperations in the Intaki system. Shipping
    reports in Intaki specifically\nhighlighted unknown silhouettes dispersed among
    the traditional Caldari\ndesigned Mordu's Legion patrols engaging in interdiction
    activities as\nwell as seemingly leading the patrol fleets.\n\nEventually these
    new ships were classified under CONCORD records,\nrevealing three new ships to
    be deployed by the Legion. A frigate class,\nthe [Garmur](Garmur); a cruiser class,
    the\n[Orthus](Orthus); and a battleship class, the\n[Barghest](Barghest). Disclosed
    statistics for the ships\ndisplayed a preference for advanced missile technology
    and long range\nwarp drive disruption, seemingly derived from both Caldari and
    Gallente\ntechnology. More importantly these new ship classes are entirely\ndesigned
    from the ground up to accommodate capsule command systems,\nunlike their older
    Caldari designs which have mostly been traditional\nbridge crew operated with
    very few capsuleer pilots among the Legion in\ngeneral.\n\nThis has re-sparked
    speculation surrounding the nature of the\nrelationship between the Mordu's Legion
    and their Caldari and Gallente\npartners. Ishukone, not only known for their introduction
    of capsule\ntechnology granted to them by the [Jove Empire](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G),
    have been major influences in the development of missile technology now\nprevalent
    in most Caldari ship designs today. It was later\nrevealed that the Legion had
    acquired the use of one of Ishukone's\nthink-tanks, Kiiragustektaa, to help design
    a new ship, fitting to the\nneeds of the Legion in their new role in Intaki. This
    same think-tank\nwas recently credited with the development of the advanced [Target\nSpectrum
    Breaker](Target-Spectrum-Breaker-(lore)) system.\n\nWhile the Legion has not confirmed
    any specifics, stating it as a matter\nof proprietary security, it is thought
    this may have been a larger part\nof their deal to secure Intaki space. Ishukone
    have also refused to\ncomment on this, citing similar reasons of confidentiality.\n\nWilder
    speculation as to the origin of the Gallente technology, evident\nin the systems
    powering the long range scrambling technology, range from\nback-room deals made
    with Gallente corporations following their role on\nCaldari Prime to the rumored
    ties with the Intaki Syndicate.\n\nMilitary experts have stated that the emphasis
    on long range\ninterdiction technology is aimed at increasing their effectiveness
    as\npeacekeepers and paramilitary police in the Caldari-Gallente warzone.\nThis
    may signal a wider shift towards such roles in the future.\n\nIncreased Recruitment
    Activity\n------------------------------\n\nThe Legion didn't actually participate
    in the fighting, but their rapid\nresponse and clear willingness to get involved
    has earned them plenty of\nadditional friends within the Caldari Navy and\n[Megacorporation]'[Megacorporation](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy)'
    security forces.\nRecruitment activity is at an all time high as the Legion has
    been\nactively seen seeking new recruits among the disaffected soldiers in the\ncurrent
    warzones. Fuelled by the recent turmoil following the dissolving\nof the Caldari
    Providence Directorate and Tibus Heth's regime, many\nCaldari soldiers have taken
    to joining the Legion seeking to put their\nmilitary skills to use in a different
    field. Likewise, Gallente military\npersonnel who are seeing the Legion operate
    up close in their role on\nCaldari Prime are known to have resigned their positions
    in the\nFederation Navy in exchange for employment with the Legion. \n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n-
