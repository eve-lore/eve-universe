- body: 'Braea was engaged to [Gerets](2aEWu9u6DutHQk9ovhWiei) before his disfigurement
    by an orbital bombardment on [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i). Braea still
    intended to go through with the wedding, even as military publicists trotted them
    out as tragic symbols of the war, military propaganda to encourage the support
    of the people. She was at risk of becoming a martyr for duty as her reasons for
    staying with her fiance changed and he became more distant. Both she and Gerets
    would have been entirely beholden to the government had it not been for very large
    donations made in their names by an unnamed [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ).
