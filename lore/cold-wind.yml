    and a guiding force for its tribesmen, described as "the first of the

    Winds to blow among the [Kaalakiota Peaks](tSXx52ZNNlyu2MYXtOiMT)

    and the one that loves things that grow strong."


    Cold Wind is seen as first of the Winds, the parent of all others; all

    the Winds have their domains, but for Cold Wind he is everywhere. Cold

    Wind is all the frosty air of Caldari Prime personified, the crisp,

    clear air with a gentle morning breeze of a Caldari winter and the

    punishing gales sweeping off the glaciers with the force to blow small

    villages right off the map. All other Winds look up to him, and work

    with him to shape the Caldari. To the Caldari, he was always near to

    them and he was the one breathed the seeds of knowledge to their

    ancestors. He welcomed them when they first came to the world and told

    them the stories of its creation. Of all the spirits, he is the closest

    to the Maker''s will, and his love for the worthy and disappointment with

    the unworthy is unmatched.


    Other divine entities include

    [Wind-of-the-West](3FsbhfAVn48VZcWAXiTReI), [Mountain Wind](NEtuLo38zgFK9ZA0sGYCk),

    [Heart-of-the-Forest](3zH6qMixgVJtQUgHF3KFFM), and [Storm Wind](vAU7b4dGGPGQNp6QRw6mX).
