    At one point he visited a bar where he met [Annes](7Bqq6D5C1V2ysqEID8wOG8) and

    [Triat](331ej8qexWhiEiFsLNZJuF). Sispur reflected with them on the current

    state of the Republic, bemoaning his position as a Nefantar. He sees

    himself as a mirror onto which others reflect their views of the

    Republic; either he is a hero for helping save the

    [Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw) or he is a

    [traitor](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz) to the Minmatar. Despite his misgivings,

    he has realized that the Republic is the only place he could ever truly

    live.
