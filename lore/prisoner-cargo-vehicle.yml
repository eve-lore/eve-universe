- body: 'A **prisoner cargo vehicle**, as the name indicates, is a type of ground

    transport used to ferry prisoners between secure locations.


    A notable example is the "Bertha", a large prisoner cargo vehicle in use

    by the [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) on at least one of their secure

    (and secret) prisons. It has thick tires and large doors and is capable

    of transporting a large number of prisoners at once over unforgiving and

    hot terrain.
