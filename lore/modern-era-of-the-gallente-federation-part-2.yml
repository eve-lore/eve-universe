- body: "Continued from [part 1](4Iz8iT9QLABGy1wWXh2mdi).\n\n###Late Civil War Period\nThe
    Federation continued its advances towards core Caldari systems, and it looked
    as if victory was at hand. However, even if the Jove had assisted the Federation
    in the liberation of the Minmatar, they would then turn to assist the Caldari,
    adding in a force multiplier that would stem the tide once again.\n\n####Capsule
    Counterattacks\nThe Caldari Navy\u2019s first response to the Federation\u2019s
    drones was the replacement of solo-fighters with frigates in the same year as
    the Minmatar Rebellion of FC95 (23216AD). This was enough to place the war firmly
    back in the realm of stalemate, even considering the additional crew requirements
    of the frigate.\n\nIn FC103 (23224AD), Federation forces began encountering Caldari
    frigates that were far faster and maneuverable than anything encountered prior.
    It did not take long for Federal intelligence to discover that the Jove had given
    the Caldari a technology known as the hydrostatic capsule. It was able to remove
    the crew requirements on frigates, and give the pilot increased maneuvering options.
    Faced the enemy\u2019s renewed vigor, the Gallente focused on increasing the speed
    and damage of their own drones. While this was never enough to completely counter
    the benefits of the capsule, it did eventually allow the Gallente to prevent the
    Caldari from making significant territorial gains against them.\n\nVictories would
    be scored by both sides, making them confident of their newfound strategies.\n\n####Battle
    of Iyen-Oursta\nLocated on the fringes of Federation space and close to the Caldari
    core was an industrious planetbound civilization on the planet of Iyen-Oursta
    VII. Neither a client of the Caldari or a member of the Federation, the system
    of Iyen-Oursta was mostly ignored, even if both sides saw it as a potential entrypoint
    into one another\u2019s territories.\n\nConsidering the industrial value and strategic
    location of Iyen-Oursta, both the Federation and the Caldari considered moving
    into the system in FC105 (23226AD). Each side claimed they would be protecting
    the local civilization from invasion by the other, but the truth of the matter
    was that both sides wanted control of the system to boost their own war effort.
    The Caldari knew that if the Federation claimed Iyen-Oursta, the Gallente would
    have a straight shot at New Caldari only a few lightyears away. The State would
    thus move to prevent this conquest from occurring.\n\nBoth sides were confident
    of victory, each with their own unique weapon to bring to the field. The Federation
    and State threw everything they had at the system, knowing very well that this
    would be the battle that would decide the fate of the war. Clashing in orbit of
    Iyen-Oursta\u2019s planets the result was the second-largest space battle in [New
    Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk), second only to the Battle of Vak\u2019Atioth of
    the Amarr-Jove War. The battle raged for a whole day, and though each side claimed
    they were protecting Iyen-Oursta VII from the other, no planetside battle ever
    took place.\n\nDuring a lapse in the action after almost fifteen hours of constant
    fighting, Caldari Navy forces began to withdraw, leaving the battlefield to the
    Federation. The Federation claimed victory for achieving their primary objective
    of assuming control of the system, but the Caldari also claimed victory for they
    had inflicted considerably more losses on the enemy than they received themselves.
    The State knew that the level of casualties inflicted on the Federation meant
    that they could no longer continue their advance as the Gallente had originally
    intended, thus the Caldari felt they had achieved their own primary objective.\n\n####Distant
    thunder\nAs the Caldari had expected, support for the Federation\u2019s war effort
    after the [Battle of Iyen-Oursta](57mej5UVTU6kRfqaSdmRBv) was low. The newer generations
    were no longer interested in enacting justice for the crimes committed against
    one another over the course of the war, despite the best efforts of militant factions
    on both sides. Neither side were quite willing to sue for peace yet, as the Gallente
    were still fearful of the Amarr, and the Caldari felt that ending the war would
    be a shameful act. Eventually, however, the war would fade into nothing but small-scale
    border skirmishes and raids.\n\n####Foundation of CONCORD\nFrom the new generation,
    a faction was growing within the Federation that sought to end not only the Gallente-Caldari
    War, but end tensions and hostilities across the entire cluster. This faction
    came to be led by Senator [Aidonis Elabon](3IcoxAofkzoA9VQJbk5mPE) in FC106 (23227AD),
    a young politician with an extensive background in humanitarian development. Senator
    Elabon and other members of the Federation leadership envisioned an organization
    that would act as an interstellar mediator, where all five of the major nations
    in New Eden could come together to air grievances and resolve disputes without
    resorting to violence.\n\nSenator Elabon was aware that the Gallente Federation
    was itself founded for similar purposes originally, however, and that a second
    attempt at such a body should not have the cultural and political partiality that
    characterized the early Federation. Knowing the Caldari would never accept the
    founding of such an organization immediately, Senator Elabon approached the Jove
    Empire first. The Jove quickly agreed to advance the cause of peace. With their
    technological prowess, they began to covertly influence the proceedings, pointing
    Elabon next to the Amarr Empire. The Jove and Senator Elabon hoped to demonstrate
    to the Caldari that, by inviting the Federation\u2019s largest rival to join,
    this organization couldn\u2019t possibly be a Gallente proxy.\n\nHeir politics
    in the Amarr Empire stifled the first few years of discussions, but eventually
    the Amarr agreed to enter negotiations so long as the Minmatar were barred from
    the table. Senator Elabon agreed, knowing that the Minmatar had already agreed
    to the organization's foundation in principle and believing he could eventually
    wear down the Empire into allowing them to join.\n\nBy FC109 (23230AD), the Amarr
    relented and allowed the Republic\u2019s representatives to join the table, which
    meant the Empire regarded Minmatar space as an independent nation rather than
    a rebellious territory. The Caldari, noting Amarr receptiveness and having signed
    a non-aggression pact with them a few years earlier, sent representatives from
    their [Chief Executive Panel](5CmaMqj1ZsFw2j4C12JpmV) to engage in the discussions
    as well. There were factions and elements across all four of these nations who
    despised these talks, but those in power cared little for it.\n\nIn FC112 (23233AD),
    the Consolidated Cooperation and Relations Command, or CONCORD, was founded by
    all five empires. Its headquarters were to be located in the independent constellation
    of Sanctum, bordering Federation and Amarr space. The Federation\u2019s first
    representative to CONCORD was Senator Aidonis Elabon himself, many feeling him
    to be the perfect man for the job.\n\nCONCORD\u2019s first action was to monitor
    the border with the Minmatar Republic and the Amarr Empire (including the Ammatar
    Mandate), to ensure that border skirmishes and guerrilla activities were minimized.\n\n####Yoiul
    Conference\nIn FC115 (23236AD), the five empires, under the umbrella of CONCORD,
    met onboard the Jove cruiser Yoiul in an effort to lay the groundwork for further
    peace. One of the most important decisions to be made was the establishment of
    a universal time-keeping system that would ease interstellar trade and communication.
    The Empire initially pushed for the other nations to adopt its calendar, arguing
    both that the Empire remained the largest nation in New Eden and the Minmatar
    were familiar with the calendar from their time in slavery.\n\nThe Minmatar rejected
    that notion vehemently, while both the Caldari and Gallente were resistant as
    well. Though the Federal Calendar was a 365-day calendar like the Amarr\u2019s
    proposal, the Federation used a different system for individual weeks and days,
    and they were reluctant to uproot their established working week even for the
    sake of international cooperation.\n\nEventually, three groups arose in the conference;
    the 25ers, the Traditionalists, and the Arithmetics. The Empire aligned itself
    most closely with the Traditionalists, who desired to use an old \u201Ccommon
    calendar\u201D favored by early post-collapse settlers. The Empire possessed old
    records, some believed to date back even before the collapse of the [EVE Gate](2z1KQXUVtPP1WmlwcJaX4o),
    which recorded significant, if rather cryptic, details of this calendar.\n\nThe
    Traditionalists eventually won out and utilized Amarr assistance in reconstructing
    the calendar, establishing the year of the conference as YC0. Many places in the
    Federation would continue to use FC, a local timekeeping system, or even the old
    Age of Rouvenor calendar. As far as interacting with and within space went, however,
    the new Yoiul system was the interstellar standard.\n\n####Presidency of Aidonis
    Elabon\nIn YC1 (FC116), Aidonis Elabon was elected to become President of the
    Gallente Federation, his rivals offering almost no competition whatsoever. He
    promised to end the war and set the Federation back on its original mission (or
    at least Elabon\u2019s interpretation of it) of establishing itself as the champion
    of peace and justice, demonstrating the founding of CONCORD as an achievement
    to his end.\n\nPresident Elabon switched the Federation Navy to a defensive posture.
    Gallente military forces would only engage in combat if a Caldari vessel entered
    what CONCORD had now defined as Federation space. Despite the militant factions
    working against him, the President also withdrew all Gallente forces currently
    occupying State worlds and colonies, and did a clean sweep of Federation space
    to remove any Caldari forces.\n\nOnly a minority of corporations on the Chief
    Executive Panel continued hostilities, who would launch the occasional border
    raid into Federation space. Thanks to a small but influential segment of the Senate,
    President Elabon was prevented from approaching the Caldari State to sue for peace,
    the latter not being one to do so themselves, despite the fatigue shared by both
    sides.\n\nInstead, the Elabon administration focused on internal affairs within
    the Federation. As outward territorial expansion of the major empires effectively
    halted since the founding of CONCORD, the Federation looked to developing large
    tracts of its space that had been ignored up until this point. Eventually, the
    groundwork for a welfare program would be laid out, where the Federation government
    would start handing out financial aid to planetary governments or individuals
    to assist in local development or alleviate poverty.\n\nPresident Elabon\u2019s
    presidency ended after its five year term in YC6 (FC121). He would die a year
    later from a previously unknown auto-immune disease contracted from a planetary
    visit. Though peace was a closer realization than ever before, it would still
    take a few more years before it would come about officially. The former President\u2019s
    will called for a [foundation](2ZdUwi6lEN75YZoamvXA72) to be set up in his name,
    one responsible for rewarding those persons that most upheld Elabon\u2019s vision
    for peace and prosperity in the world of New Eden.\n\n###Cooperative Century\n####Peace\nIn
    YC12 (FC127), CONCORD finally decided to intervene in the waning Gallente-Caldari
    War. The relatively young organization was only bold enough to do so since it
    assumed whatever animosity existed between the two sides was on the way out, given
    the near-negligible level of fighting by this point.\n\nThe Federation leadership
    were taken aback by CONCORD\u2019s intervention. Many factions were more than
    happy to comply, thankful that they would have the support of an organization
    with a growing base of respect. A much smaller group of factions were more reluctant
    to do go along with CONCORD\u2019s missive. The Caldari State, realizing the commercial
    benefits of peace and not wanting to base its entire existence on war, agreed
    as well.\n\nAfter a mere six months of bilateral talks facilitated by CONCORD,
    a peace accord was signed in the marginal Gallente-Caldari system of Tierijev.
    All senior members of the Chief Executive Panel and a large delegation of the
    Federation leadership met in orbit of the previously wartorn planet there, and
    signed the Treaty of Tierijev.\n\nThe Gallente Federation would agree to recognize
    the sovereignty of the Caldari State, and both sides would retain their original
    outposts and settlements as per the CONCORD-designated borders. The exception
    was Caldari Prime. Though a point of contention in the negotiations, the majority
    of the CEP eventually decided pushing for the return of the planet would be far
    too costly and made the controversial decision to sign it away. It would remain
    under Federation control, which would be a source of lasting resentment within
    more militant Caldari factions.\n\nWith the war over, peace parades took place
    across Gallente space. The Federation began to focus its efforts on interstellar
    trade with its three neighbors, sharing a border with all of them. It also accelerated
    its domestic aid and development programs, which resulted in so-called \u2018boom
    worlds\u2019 cropping up across the Federation. With increased relations across
    the cluster, funding for the Gallente military was slowly but surely reduced.
    No more did the planets of the Federation have to live in the shadows of war.\n\n####Nation-Empires
    War\nThe forming of [Sansha's Nation](6dFZYDkE3R4BRF9w21mtjP) starting in YC5
    (FC120) by arms mogul [Sansha Kuvakei](17GtFlYwgztQDPD4Uotuv8) was treated with
    a mix of awe and suspicion by the Federation government. The hailing of Nation
    as a perfect utopian state would see the young state as a major rival to the Federation,
    which also saw itself as striving to become a technological utopia. As Sansha\u2019s
    Nation did not have the centuries' worth of complex political, social and economic
    baggage to hold it back, the title of the Promised Land was briefly passed on
    from the Federation.\n\nOver the decades since YC5, millions of citizens (especially
    many future-minded Gallente) would flock to Sansha\u2019s banner, falling for
    Kuvakei\u2019s popular message. The [Federal Intelligence Office](4Q7sdriIYVeeQANNNXF0nH)
    sent many of its spies and special forces with them, and would attempt to uncover
    anything that the Federation could exploit to muster a popular campaign to take
    the small rival state down.\n\nUltimately, in YC37 (FC152) it would be the Amarr\u2019s
    [Ministry of Internal Order](5P4c9Lcr1rAUNd2Lb8gb3t) who would be the first to
    discover the depravities of Sansha Kuvakei. The FIO\u2019s agents in the Empire
    corroborated the reports with their spies in Sansha space, and then again with
    intelligence acquired by the [Republic Security Services](5Iqs1mpJ1075p4JNwbuinu)
    and the Caldari State.\n\nThe populations of the Gallente, Minmatar, and Caldari
    were horrified by the revealing of Nation\u2019s true nature. Their governments
    demanded that Sansha Kuvakei be brought before a CONCORD tribunal and tried for
    his crimes. While the Amarr initially attempted to defend Kuvakei, they eventually
    came to understand they would be ostracized if they attempted to stand alone.
    They joined the others in demanding Sansha surrender himself, but Kuvakei remained
    defiant.\n\nKuvakei declared the inalienable sovereignty of his Nation and revealed
    the massive power of his [True Slave](2OMQ8inZvuePjeJdMpDz3B) fleet, which was
    enough to rival any one of the empire\u2019s navies. With diplomacy out of the
    question, the empires decided they had no choice but to band together to destroy
    Sansha's Nation. While the Gallente Federation lead the charge in space, the Empire,
    by virtue of its nearness to Sansha's space, attacked the heavily fortified stations
    and planets belonging to the Nation. They wreaked havoc across Sansha's territory,
    particularly within Esoteria, reducing much of the Nation to rubble.\n\n####Hero
    of Ouperia\nIn YC11 (FC126), a stargate construction ship had set out to the uninhabited
    system of Ouperia from the Federal capital of Villore. Following an asteroid collision,
    contact was lost soon after, and the project to colonize the system was shelved
    when it was assumed the vessel was destroyed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until YC60 (FC175)
    that it was revealed to the Federation that the expedition had not failed at all.
    Stargate controllers in the Villore solar system were completely surprised when
    the original construction vessel jumped into the system, patched up and limping
    from its damage decades earlier. The lone surviving crewmember was the ship\u2019s
    drone operator, by the name of [Ceul Darieux](20g5p8wtk0SSlgIRbROGdj). Now an
    old, gaunt man, he had managed to survive only due to his technical ingenuity.
    More remarkable was the fact he was successfully able to construct an entire stargate
    targeted at Villore by devising and building innovative drones and robot factories.\n\nDecorated
    as a hero by the Federation President and a triumphant example of the human spirit,
    Darieux revelled in the limelight of his newfound celebrity status. It didn\u2019t
    very long at all for him to found [CreoDron](3lCriaLYr0Nrmj9pkru5Z3) that year,
    centered on the blueprints he created during his voyage that lasted half a century.
    Darieux himself, in a frail body with failing internal organs, would die a few
    years later.\n\nNonetheless, the legacy remained. Ouperia was renamed Old Man
    Star in his honor, CreoDron would emerge as New Eden\u2019s largest drone manufacturer,
    driven by the innovations of its founder. His tale of using drones to survive
    captivated millions of Gallente citizens. Influenced by his story, the use of
    drones in the household multiplied tenfold, with many city authorities beginning
    to utilize drones in their municipal services. Through CreoDron, drones would
    became permeated across the Federation\u2019s societies.\n\n####Rise of organized
    piracy\nThe Federation had always dealt with pirates in its history, mostly those
    who raid trading vessels for profit, or undefended colonies for prisoners. However,
    since the slowdown of empire expansion and the rise of independent factions following
    the founding of CONCORD, organized pirate groups with military-esque training
    and structure began cropping up along the outer regions.\n\n#####Angel Cartel\nThe
    first pirate faction that emerged was the [Angel Cartel](3p6aB4GMbVdMUEVYOb3kF0)
    in YC4 (FC119), but at first they would remain nothing more than a muscle-for-hire
    beyond the fringes of empire space. Over time, they began to harass the Minmatar
    Republic following the Cartel\u2019s migration to the Curse region. In response,
    the Federation military would often work alongside its Minmatar counterpart in
    dealing with incursions along the Republic border.\n\n#####Serpentis Corporation\nOrganized
    piracy would come closer to home within the Federation in YC75 (FC190), when [Salvador
    Sarpati](4uoKdzOSHLBe297ANAvD2G), adopted son of competent Gallente scientist
    [Igil Sarpati](RXTwtvBOyj3KtTDv5OOh4) purchased a system in the outer Gallente
    region of Fountain, naming it Serpentis. There, he headquartered his [Serpentis
    Corporation](64u7D7YksvODwmCFL3llMs). The Serpentis corporation was the hi-tech
    R&D successor of his father\u2019s research company (called Sarpati), which was
    run into the ground after boosters were declared illegal by the Federation.\n\nSerpentis
    began opening up numerous research installations in remote pockets of Gallente
    space and elsewhere. These research stations ended up growing into notorious pirate
    havens. The Serpentis would sell its latest weapon and starship technologies to
    smaller pirate syndicates, who would go on to harass the Gallente in space and
    on the ground. This soured relations with the Federation, who declared the Serpentis
    an illegal corporation. In response, the Serpentis cut a deal with the [Guardian
    Angels](13iuE2XufxAu060NRm4hhd) of the Angel Cartel to provide protection for
    all corporate installations.\n\nEventually, the Serpentis would train its own
    professional military fleet, conducting its illegal operations alongside the Angel
    Cartel across the Federation and beyond. It would emerge as the largest criminal
    syndicate in Gallente space, having interests in numerous grey and black markets.
    The corporation has been implicated in funding terrorist or rebel groups in addition
    to ordinary pirates, but the deep penetration of Serpentis corporate interests
    across the wide Federation means the war to dislodge them has gone for decades
    with no end in sight.\n\nEconomic interdependency with the Minmatar has resulted
    in the Serpentis corporation being able to muster into Republic space as well,
    and the two nations very frequently cooperate against them.\n\n#####Guristas\nFormer
    Caldari Navy captains [Jirai Laitanen](2cUo2UbsCruVr7VsIHmw1N) ('Fatal') and [Korako
    Kosakami](3Mb6UfjhKf0MdSbbR4a2EU) ('the Rabbit') became famous for deserting the
    State in YC86 (FC201), forming their own pirate cartel which came to known as
    the [Guristas](5dCMr0rTopv0jEcQ0nWzoa) a few months later. Initially, this pirate
    clan kept to the Caldari State, engaging in traditional pirate activities such
    as theft, kidnapping, ransoming and sabotage of military installations.\n\nIt
    wasn\u2019t until a year later that the Federation became involved with the Guristas.
    [Luecin Rileau](2d24moamL2NaimjLpHTENT), Federal ambassador to the Caldari State
    and son of the diamond baron [Darouen Rileau](6bU1NaQ5PFYNH9YhorJMc2), was kidnapped
    by Fatal and the Rabbit while sating his gambling addiction at the Grand Tiegjon
    Casino at the [Echelon Entertainment](1dgoiyZgDb34W4DBvqnLaL) station in Vellaine,
    Lonetrek. Gallente special forces were unable to rescue the high-ranking Federal
    officer, failing to realize that the pair of traditional pirates had military
    training themselves. In the end, the ambassador\u2019s family had to pay a huge
    ransom of uncut diamonds to the Guristas.\n\nThe embarrassment inflicted on the
    Federation government moved them to seek cooperation with the Caldari State for
    joint military operations against the now-famous Guristas pirates, to which the
    Caldari responded with very limited agreement. Their rise to the fore saw hundreds
    of recruits move to join the Guristas, who then began launching operations within
    Caldari and occasionally Gallente space. Though fighting the Guristas became one
    of the few matters the Federation and State could agree on, the expansion of the
    Guristas was merely slowed down due to lack of coordination and cooperation.\n\n####Operation
    Spectrum Breach\nIn YC88 (FC203), the Federation government funded a research
    project intended to create openings into regions of unexplored space and facilitate
    the colonization of new worlds. This initative was undertaken due to the pressures
    of dealing with peacetime population booms and immigration without the addition
    of any new territory, other than the ascension of [Solitude](mQjw4DzdzeHF8rNpzaZKr)
    in YC13 (FC128). If successful, it was hoped to be hailed to be the greatest colonization
    project in Federation history, hoping to lay claim to as many as eight regions.\n\nVast
    drone fleets were sent into the remote area of space. Stargates were constructed,
    and probes were sent out revealing mineral-rich systems ripe for colonization.
    However, four months after the first stargate was commissioned, the worker drones
    at the main outpost went berserk, killing hundreds. Reports of [Rogue Drones](3Krc0xwkty10ryEG5apWhG)
    attacks from within all eight regions surfaced concurrently and an evacuation
    of the new systems was ordered, facilitated by the Federation Navy. The Federal
    government, assisted by an unknown corporation (suspected to be CreoDron) quickly
    locked the access gates to the new regions.\n\nAll of these events were unknown
    to CONCORD, as the opening of new stargates without consent of all empires violated
    the Yulai Conventions. Nonetheless, the Federation government approached CONCORD
    for assistance with the matter of fully securing the access gates militarily.
    During a closed session of the Assembly, the Federal delegation were pressed for
    details on what had transpired beyond the sealed gates, but the Gallente diplomats
    refused to release details. CONCORD was able to bring the security of the sealed
    gates under its jurisdiction by a unanimous vote in the Assembly session. \n\nBy
    a majority vote, the decision was made to maintain a public blackout regarding
    the locations of the deactivated gates. The Federation government made record
    that an accident of some unclear nature had halted the expansion program indefinitely.
    Although Spectrum Breach would remain hidden from the public, the upper echelons
    of the other empires considered it a black mark on the Federation government.\n\n####Girani-Fa
    Incident\nIn YC95 (FC210), both the Empire and the Federation laid claim to the
    mineral-rich system of [Girani-Fa](7LZHsbmt1PviKEt8nwrvFG). Both sides wished
    to exploit its riches. While the system had nominally been claimed by the Empire
    for decades, it had not been touched by the Amarr. It was only after a Federation
    surveying team assayed the system and discovered mineral riches that the Empire
    became interested in it.\n\nThe Federation claimed the Empire had effectively
    abandoned the system, while the Empire countered that it included the system on
    official maps of the Empire. The two sides attempted to negotiate a settlement,
    but each was intractable. Eventually, the Empire stepped away from the negotiating
    table, believing the Federation was no longer acting in good faith.\n\nBoth sides
    appeared poised to go to war in the system, when the [Quafe Company](ssPYMESgTyz1rl4fTojD6)
    stepped in and offered to negotiate with the Empire. The Empire, believing that
    Quafe had a vested interest in both sides, agreed and a few weeks later came to
    an agreement was reached that prevented warfare. The system would remain under
    Amarr sovereignty, while Gallente mining companies would be free to mine there
    as long as they sold a portion of the minerals to the Empire at cost.\n\n###See
