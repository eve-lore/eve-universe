- body: '**Kapitan** is the nickname used by [Shan Arvonak](3z68XqdOxgMzUL53arlTGD)
    in reference to the Legionnaire who

    once commanded Shan during a patrol of Curse space. Shan considers Kapitan to
    be a fat old bastard who has gone soft

    after too many years with "those paper-pushing [Fed Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1)
    pod-wetters". In the end, Kapitan

    makes some poor strategic decisions during an encounter with two [Black Omega](black-omega)
    pilots which results in the destruction

    of the entire patrol gang.
