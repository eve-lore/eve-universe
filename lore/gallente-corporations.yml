    The Gallente Federation has a strong central government and thriving democracy
    that is accompanied by vibrant market economy. While their methods are usually
    more subtle, a good case could be made for considering certain Gallente corporations

- body: '### Federal Administration

    The Federal Administration has greater presence in space than the bureaucratic
    apparatus of the other empires. This is mainly due to the fact that space travel
    became a common thing for the ordinary Gallentean citizen much earlier than for
    the other empires and also because inter-stellar trade is proportionally much
    larger in the Federation than elsewhere.'
