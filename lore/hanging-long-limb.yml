- body: 'The **hanging long-limb** is an animal that comes from a methane-covered
    [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) planet. The planet''s ecosystem has not changed
    in thousands of years and remains mostly free of human intervention. While the
    long limb does have some predators, it is known to be skilled at avoiding them.
    It is not, however, a very intelligent animal, though it does have some problem
    solving abilities. It is capable of quick movement but does not do so unless attempting
    to capture food or evade a predator.
