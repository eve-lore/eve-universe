- body: 'The **Mekhios Graveyard** is a wreckage field containing the remains of

    ships that were destroyed in the [Battle of Mekhios](5rEhukOVHPitanB5Cn5jvd),
    where the [Imperial Navy](3PKvXZS0iHKIgAmO9np74g) made their stand against the

    [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) Elder invasion. A battle of epic

    proportions took place as both empires unleashed their ancient hatred of

    one another. Legend has it that untold numbers of Minmatar patriots lost

    their lives in an instant when [Jamyl Sarum](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L)

    herself appeared on the battlefield. The question of how she could

    singlehandedly repel such a vast armada remains a mystery. Rumors of a

    secret superweapon abound; others swear that it was divine intervention

    which turned the Minmatar invaders into dust.


    A few large fragments of specific ships, such as Naglfar class

    dreadnaughts, and Tempest, Apocalypse, and Armageddon class

    battleships are still identifiable, but

    all smaller ships were too damaged to remain identifiable. Rumors

    persist that there are still survivors on some ships, but this seems

    unlikely.


    The graveyard can be found near the planet [Mekhios](3VOfvlm6gGI0LRutDj5MhI)

    in the [Sarum Prime](uO7T7UMc6L0S8OUcHJJqP) system in the Domain

    region.
