- body: '**Mister B** is employed by an unnamed [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ)

    and, along with [Mister H](oozD2ZbqZvu1AGLUnlx1j), rescues a base-liner

    named [Rokan](7h4XGy7U2yQbO6l9PP9IsT) from being beaten to death by security

    guards, in order to pitch a job to Rokan. In actual fact, Mister B and

    his companion wish to turn Rokan into a test subject to further their

    research for the capsuleer into how capsuleers might better interface

    with ships and ship systems. Rokan, with his talent for bypassing

    security systems, appears to be an ideal candidate for such research

    even though he isn''t a capsuleer. Their initial tests on Rokan alter his

    perceptions of what is happening to him and Mister B is not surprised

    when Rokan happily ''volunteers'' for the work.
