    interstellar travel in [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk).


    The theory and technology behind stargates opened up a whole new era in

    the history of mankind and is readily accepted as being one of the most

    important discoveries of all times. Jump gates have now been in usage

    for centuries and new versions appear regularly that make them more

    sophisticated and safe.


    Operational uncertainty

    -----------------------


    Even if the functions of jump gates are well known from a theoretical

    point of view, there still remain a lot of unanswered questions about

    the fundamentals of dimensional inter-connections. Naturally, many

    theories exist on the subject, but none are comprehensive enough to

    fully explain how the universe is divided into many dimensions and the

    connections between them, some also touch upon the subject of

    hyperspace, an alternative plain in another dimension. About the only

    statement these theories agree upon is that these issues are definitely

    not as simple as they seem on the surface. However, these theories are

    still a topic of research, and stargate technology is being continually

    refined, with new jump gate designs appearing regularly to improve

    safety and efficiency.


    Part of a stargate''s operation involves the use of superheated plasma,

    which can be vented into space. If vented improperly, it is possible

    that the plasma may be attracted away from the jump gate''s boson sphere

    toward an approaching ship, where it may react with the ship''s shields

    to produce a harmless visual phenomenon, such as the

    [Lutins](4QBHzmS7145cgUWIpghBqV) observed near the Perimeter gate in

    [Iyen-Oursta](5UH2LQJuHPZw0izWU685Wl).
