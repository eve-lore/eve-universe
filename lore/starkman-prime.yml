    known as **Starkman Prime**. It is a once-hot and temperate world that has undergone
    massive cataclysmic atmospheric and climate change as the result of orbital bombardment,
    and is now listed as barren.\n\n## Historical Background\n\n### Discovery and
    Settlement\n\nNothing is recorded of the planet once known as Starkman Prime,
    nor the system it is in, prior to approximately 21800 AD. If it contained ruins
    of an earlier civilization, there is no mention of it in any records, nor do we
    know of any pre-existing name for the system. What is known is that the [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp),
    using ancient jump gates, were the first to rediscover the system, though what
    they named has been lost to history. Shortly after discovering the lush, tropical
    world of this star's second planet, the [Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw) used
    their influence to have it named Starkman Prime.\n\nCiting conditions of over-crowding
    on [Matar](5gheCRHTWLbi5jzbo5vvT6), the Starkmanir, by far the largest of the
    tribes, soon made the fateful decision to move to Starkman Prime. The lands of
    the Eyniletti Plains, their ancestral home on Matar, were put into the joint ownership
    of the remaining tribes, and with few exceptions, the Starkmanir relocated.\n\nMany
    visiting members of other tribes found Starkman Prime's proximity to the unforgiving
    sun, the smell of rotting vegetation that permeated everything, and the ever-encroaching
    jungle with its plethora of tropical insects to be unpleasant at best. The Starkmanir,
    having originated in the equatorial region of Matar, jokingly claimed to not notice
    the heat and spoke of Starkman Prime as a new Matar.\n\nThe Starkmanir flourished
    here for the next six hundred years, spreading out across the planet in small
    settlements. With the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) occupation of Matar in 22480
    AD, the economy was thrown into a tailspin. It was just beginning to recover when
    the Amarr turned their sights on Starkman Prime.\n\n### Occupation and Destruction\n\nStarkman
    Prime was conquered quickly by the Amarr, and the still sparsely populated and
    undeveloped planet was put under the jurisdiction of the [Ardishapur Family](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO).
    The star was named Arzad in honor of the youngest heir in the Hamri family, and
    the Minmatar name for the system was lost to history.\n\nThe Starkmanir credited
    the nature of the planet now known as Arzad II itself with creating the goodwill
    that came to exist here between holder and slave, and at first, they suffered
    far less than the other tribes.\n\nWith the Empire still reeling from the secession
    of the [Khanid Kingdom](5VtgxEr1vnxuazt8lvQLoj) mere decades earlier, the [Theology
    Council](38uUjWk3RiR80FqDwjmQWk) grew uncomfortable with the precedents being
    set on Arzad II, and imperial authorities eventually ordered [Arzad Hamri](69ZNIvkNAGdUna0jedLzBw)
    tried for treason and blasphemy. \n\nFound guilty and executed, his death caused
    [great unrest](6zCt6sjhgwfu6uZ0iEIC8K) among the Starkmanir people and started
    a chain of events that led [Idonis Ardishapur](2ZNvkPaPzpj4IaVpL2vWK3) \u2013
    himself not immune to the charms of Starkman Prime \u2013 to ordering the orbital
    bombardment and complete annihilation of the planet. Much like the system's namesake,
    Arzad II did not lose its influence with its destruction, and it is this sequence
    of events in 22947 AD that is widely acknowledged to be a seminal inciting incident
    in the [Minmatar Rebellion](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N) over two hundred and fifty
    years later.\n\n## Today\n\nListed as a barren planet, the heat is all that remains
    of this once\ntropical world. Now it is a rocky landscape devoid of the moisture
    which\nonce provided much of the former lushness of this world. The only rivers\nthat
    still flow over the planet are of magma. In places where new\ndisturbances have
    disrupted the tectonic plates they are hot and quickly\nmoving, while in others
    they have cooled and hardened mid-flow. Geysers\nand vents open on the surface
    in seemingly random intervals. Steam,\nsulphur, and other gases spew from these
    into the already poisoned air,\nonly to return as acidic rain. Massive dust storms
    and hurricanes rage\nevery dawn and dusk due to the planet's weakened ability
    to regulate\nheat. All this, combined with the continual earthquakes caused by
    the\nstill unstable tectonic plates make Arzad II an unlikely place to ever\nhold
    life again. Which is exactly why Ardishapur scouts were astonished\nto discover
    a small population living here a few decades ago.\n\nFollowing a small pirate
    ship with no identification, the scouts were\neventually led to Sorrow's Gash,
    a one-hundred-mile-long canyon created\nby Amarr lasers during the bombardment.
    Inside the canyon, tucked into a\nledge high up on the wall they found a settlement
    made of interconnected\nhabitation modules known as Vo'Shun or Hidden Hope. Though
    its\ninhabitants turned out to be outcasts from the Minmatar Republic rather\nthan
    Starkmanir survivors, Idonis Ardishapur nonetheless issued the\nedict Khadrea's
    Law, which protects the planet and its current\ninhabitants from any further harm.
    This leaves those outcast on Arzad II\nin the curious position of being protected
    by those that enslave their\nkin, and shunned and left to die by those same kin.
    It also leaves the\nplanet itself protected by the very people that destroyed
    it.\n\n### Orbit and Climate\n\nAs Arzad II has an orbit radius of only 0.364
    AU, giving it a year of\n15.6 days, there are no seasons. Arzad II's slow rate
    of rotation gives\nit a day of 26.8 hours. Once significantly warmer, the planet
    now\nmaintains a yearly average mean temperature of 238 Kelvin, or -35.15\nCelsius.
    The entirety of the planet's heat loss can be traced to causes\nresulting from
    the Amarr bombardment.\n\n### Tectonic Plates\n\nAll remaining records of former
    tectonic plates on the planet are\ninvalid. With the planet in the middle of the
    war zone, and the still\nhighly unstable nature of its crust, it is not likely
    to be surveyed\nanytime soon.\n\n### Continents and Oceans\n\nBetween the Amarr
    destruction of Minmatar books and writings, gaps in\nthe records of prominent
    holders under the Ardishapur Family, and\nthe number of records left behind to
    be destroyed with the planet, very\nlittle remains. There were continents, so
    presumably an ocean, though no\nfurther conclusions can be drawn from the scant
    evidence available.\n\n## See Also\n-   [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)\n-   [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp)\n-
