- body: '**Terran** is a term used to refer to a hypothetical progenitor race

    that colonized [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) prior to the

    collapse of the [EVE Gate](2z1KQXUVtPP1WmlwcJaX4o). Little is known about

    this race, though they left numerous artifacts across the cluster,

    including old [stargates](416pCzXGIwn2Tt7feZYSpk) and the EVE Gate itself.
