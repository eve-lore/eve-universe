- body: '## Minmatar Corporations

    The Minmatar Republic''s complex society of tribes and clans is made even more
    complicated by the many corporations that operate throughout its space. Minmatar
    corporations often have tribal or clan affiliations, though some are run by Minmatar
    circles or are controlled by unaffiliated ownership structures.'

- body: '## Government Organizations

    The central government of the Minmatar Republic is essentially controlled by the
    Tribal Council and Republic Parliament. The Minmatar value their tribal and clan
    sovereignties but have found it necessary to maintain a relatively powerful unified
    government given the various threats to their freedom.'

    Once an uninspiring part of the Minmatar government the Justice Department has
    in recent years taken on a life of its own by supporting the Minmatar rebels.
    Though not an official policy of the Republic, the Justice Department promotes
    what most Minmatars secretly want: to defeat the Amarrians, and is thus cordially
    allowed by the Parliament.'

    The Parliament is the main political vehicle in the Minmatar Republic and has
    replaced the gathering of the tribal leaders as the place of power and decision.
    Though the Parliament has little say in the internal affairs of the tribes it
    acts as the voice of the Minmatar people to the outside world and governs the
    relations with foreign powers.'

    The Minmatars learnt early on in their freedom that it can only be kept by wrapping
    it in secrets and deceit. The vigilance of the RSS has helped the Republic weather
    many storms that threatened to engulf the fledgling state. The RSS has strong
    links with the underworld elements in the world of EVE, the information exchange
    and black marketing strengthens both sides.'

    Originally part of the Minmatar government, Urban Management was responsible for
    allocating land and real estate in the wake of the Rebellion. Once the chaos subsided
    the company broke from the government and started operating on its own. Yet it
    still retains many important administrative functions in the Republic.'

    Each of the Seven Tribes of Matar have seen fit to organize their interstellar
    interests in various corporations, principally their primary tribal corporations.
    In recent years, various private military companies each tribe established have
    become more akin to tribal paramiliaries than mere mercenary outfits.'

- body: '### Brutor Tribe

    The Brutors suffered the worst under the Amarr occupation and many of them are
    still enslaved within the Amarr Empire. This fuels their hate for the Amarrians
    and they are the only tribe to actively pursue a continuation of the war against
    the Amarrians and their underlings, the Ammatars.


    The Brutor are marked by a disciplined stoicism and deeply spiritual cast of mind
    that combine to project a sense of nobility around the people of this tribe. While
    the Brutor have a traditional mindset, they suffered great loss of cultural heritage
    and knowledge of their history during the Amarr occupation. To the occasional
    annoyance of the other tribes, the Brutor consider themselves responsible for
    the freedom of the entire Minmatar people and make no bones about standing on
    this claim for political purposes when it suits them. In particular, the Brutor
    are great supporters and protectors of the Starkmanir Tribe, on account of the
    former originating as an offshoot of the latter. The Brutor Tribe was one of the
    four founding tribes of the Minmatar Republic following the success of the Great
    Rebellion.'

    The Brutor Tribe approach to warfare is classically a no-nonsense, assault-oriented

    soldiers to fulfill the needs of each job as well as deploying its own seasoned
    troopers.'

    The Krusual tribe is cautious and cunning, shrouding its ways in subterfuge and
    secrecy. It is isolationist by nature, but lately it''s been becoming more and
    more involved with the power politics of the Republic, staking a claim for its
    mastery.


    Pride is a common Minmatar trait, but the Krusual are wont to take it to extraordinary
    lengths. They rarely lose an opportunity to remind the other tribes that they
    alone managed to maintain strongholds in the mountainous Tronhadar region of Matar
    during the Amarr occupation. It is certainly remarkable that in all the long years
    of the occupation, the Amarr were unable to once and for all crush Krusual resistance.
    Their ability to hold onto a certain amount of independence during the occupation
    resulted in the Krusual retaining more of their pre-conquest culture than any
    other tribe, and their underground bases played an important role in sheltering
    some Vherokior mystics. The Krusual Tribe was one of the four founding tribes
    of the Minmatar Republic following the success of the Great Rebellion.'

- body: '### Nefantar Council

    The [Nefantar Tribe](1lfEcB4SdrV3EJIrmYWOK2) played a notorious role during the
    Amarr Empire''s occupation of the Minmatar home worlds as collaborators who actively
    assisted in the enslavement of other tribes by the Amarr. The Nefantar were so
    faithful to the Amarr that Emperor Damius III bestowed the name "Ammatar" upon
    them. When the Great Rebellion succeeded in driving the Amarr from the Minmatar
    Regions, the Amarr subsequently set up the Nefantar in a puppet state called the
    Ammatar Mandate. Unbeknownst to anyone else, certain Ammatar elites had hidden
    a large number of Starkmanir Tribe survivors from the Amarr within the Mandate.


    After the discovery of the Starkmanir led to a Minmatar invasion in YC110, the
    Nefantar conspirators and their families led a mass defection of many Ammatar
    back to the Minmatar Republic, assisting in the recovery of the Starkmanir. Today,
    the Nefantar tribe has been restored as one of the Seven Tribes of Matar, even
    while many of their tribe remain loyal to the Amarr Empire back in the Mandate.'

    The Sebiestors are technically and mechanically inclined, much Minmatar technology
    comes from them. The Sebiestors have always been a leading tribe in the Minmatar
    Republic, though their authority has many times been under attack from the crafty
    Krusual tribe, their main rivals in Republic politics.


    With a culture emphasizing the virtues of patience, contemplation, and practical
    skill, the Sebiestor are known far and wide as engineers and inventors. The Sebiestor
    reputation for tinkering with any kind of technology is well deserved, and this
    excellence in engineering naturally propelled the Sebiestor to the fore during
    the period when the old Minmatar Empire pushed into space. During the Amarr occupation,
    the Sebiestor did much to hold what remained of Minmatar society together with
    their skill at maintaining or adapting technology. The Sebiestor Tribe was one
    of the four founding tribes of the Minmatar Republic following the success of
    the Great Rebellion.'

    would focus on combat engineering. The Sebiestor Field Sappers offer battlefield
    engineering and siegecraft services to any who can pay their considerable rates.

    Subjected to an Amarr campaign of annihilation, the [Starkmanir Tribe](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw)
    was considered lost for centuries until the discovery in YC110 of a viable surviving
    population hidden by Nefantar elites on Halturzhan, the sixth planet of Jarizza
    in the Ammatar Mandate. The discovery spurred a Minmatar fleet into an invasion
    of Amarr territories with a view to recovering the Starkmanir and as many other
    enslaved Minmatar as possible. The vast majority of surviving Starkmanir were
    successfully recovered, evacuated to the Minmatar Republic, and settled on lands
    set aside for them by the larger tribes.


    Though few in number, the Starkmanir have full status as one of the Seven Tribes
    of Matar and govern their affairs through a council of clan chiefs headed by the
    overall chief of the Starkmanir Tribe.

    The [Thukker Tribe](3uoxvtJY1Z30BoVwuJLj2z) is a loose confederation of nomadic
    fleets and transient colonies dominated by the Great Caravans that roam the space
    of the Great Wildlands region, rather than by the large clans more typical of
    other Minmatar tribes. The Council of Caravans is the Thukker equivalent of a
    council of clan chiefs. Lesser caravans generally acknowledge the authority of
    the Council and Tribal Chief, even if only nominally, but Thukker organized as
    more standard clans, the so-called "clanners", operate more independently than
    caravaners and have a well-earned reputation as renegades, pirates, and ruthless
    mercenaries.


    The Thukker Tribe is one of the seven original Minmatar tribes. After the Minmatar
    Rebellion the Thukkers left Minmatar space and took up the nomadic lifestyles
    of their ancestors, only this time in space. The closest thing they''ve got to
    home is the Great Wildlands region, where they are very numerous, but the Thukkers
    like to be on the move, constantly going from one solar system to another in their
    huge caravans, trading and scavenging.'

- body: "### Vherokior Tribe\nThe Vherokior tribe is perhaps the least troubled of
    the Minmatar tribes, with little aspiration for dominance, content to live on
    the fringe. Most Vherokiors are shop-keepers or small scale businessmen, seldom
    venturing into the interstellar corporate leagues.\n\nVherokior are disinclined
    to engage in great collective efforts, and their various clans are rather loosely
    grouped under the tribal chief\u2019s authority. Indeed, the clans themselves
    hold nominal authority in many cases, with the family being by far the most important
    social unit to the individual Vherokior. These families are traditionally matriarchal
    in structure, though the aftermath of the Amarrian occupation has disrupted this
    pattern somewhat, as with so many other aspects of Minmatar tribal culture. Most
    Vherokior have long-abandoned the ancient nomadism of their tribe but the Vherokior
    mystics are the guardians of the Voluval Ritual and travel immense distances in
    this role. The Vherokior Tribe was one of the four founding tribes of Minmatar
