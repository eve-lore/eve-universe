- body: '**Robert (''Bob'')** is a station worker originally in charge of Tech I

    blueprint improvement and approval for

    a subsection of his corporation. He''s a nervous type, overweight and

    nearing retirement age, who puts great stock in having the work routines

    of today resemble as much as possible those of yesterday. Modern

    communications methods are anathema to him, and his

    office usually has the door firmly

    closed.


    When Tech II blueprints for various ship

    modules came out, Bob was working for [Duvolle Laboratories](1khBWLK52GfHvRQ1xUrOPb),
    though likely not for a

    whole lot longer.
