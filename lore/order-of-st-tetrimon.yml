    Order, and simply the Tetrimon, is an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) religious
    order. It was founded in 21460 AD following the death of the Mad Emperor, [Zaragram
    II](1DsGoYgw9GBQN8lqX77VlE), at the hands of his grandson, who was canonized as
    [St. Tetrimon](3oR2akT6mzavwkTXD52j5X).\n\n\n### Conflict with other authorities
    \nThe Order was tasked with purging Amarr [Scripture](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp) of
    apocryphal and non-canon texts, which included the majority of Zaragram II\u2019s
    decrees. As part of this goal, it was asked to preserve the original Scriptures.
    In time, this led to the Order\u2019s downfall, as it put them in opposition to
    the [Privy Council](privy-council), [Theology Council](38uUjWk3RiR80FqDwjmQWk),
    and [Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) during the Moral Reforms. \n\n\n### Exile\nThe
    Order managed to remain active in small sects thanks to acting against the Reforms
    in secret. They hid away the artifacts and records of the [Council of Apostles](nTZLcvZprqLLUiGIaVQu7).
    However, during the [Khanid Rebellion](4O0h6TYzDTC6bEHncE0ICQ), the Order was
    exiled from the Empire by [Heideran VII](4Olxc4nxWd7y1mjFPhvHnV). It managed to
    remain active in the [Khanid Kingdom](khanid-kingdom), where [Khanid II](5HlA8KgFOuLy4jTf3t54xf)
    allowed it to remain legal for political reasons.\n\n\n### Recent Events \nDuring
    the [Minmatar Rebellion](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N), the Order was allowed to return
    to the Empire to fight the [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp), with the understanding
    that they not undermine Heideran\u2019s rule. They mostly remained quiet in the
    following years, except for actions taken against then-[Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh)
    [Doriam](1aaBMbCysLA8uJjQQczFwT), who proved too liberal for their tastes.\n\n###
