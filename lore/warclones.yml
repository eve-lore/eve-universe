    Warclones are a varied class of cloned humans whose augmented bodies are designed
    for military service on land, air, and in space. Very different to capsuleer spaceship
    pilots, warclones are most famously known to the general New Eden public as soldiers
    and aerospace craft crew. The latter are well-known to consumers of mass-media
    holovids as space fighter pilots. The former are increasingly prevalent in the
    militaries of the empires but are most notorious as mercenaries.'

- body: "## Rise of the Clone Soldiers\n\nFor the last two decades, capsuleers have
    clearly been the most powerful and influential class of augmented beings in New
    Eden. Now they are joined\u2014possibly challenged, perhaps aided and abetted\u2014by
    a new class of clone: a highly augmented foot soldier, equipped with state-of-the-art
    technology and capable of feats that make normal soldiers pale in comparison.\n\nOne
    of the old empires developed these supersoldiers for its own ends, but swiftly
    became alarmed by unstable aspects of their nature and tried to suppress this
    potentially dangerous new class. The other empires followed suit, but their attempts
    failed. The clone soldiers are thought to have enjoyed the aid of unknown outside
    forces, but due to their incredible efficiency in combat, this is not necessarily
    the case. After repelling the empires in hundreds of thunderous clashes, these
    supersoldiers established enclaves and corporations of mercenary clone fighters.
    Inevitably, many of them joined forces with capsuleer factions, corporations,
    and alliances, thus cementing their foothold in New Eden.\n\nSome wonder at the
    nature of the clone mercenaries, and many make the natural assumption that they
    are much like the capsuleers. This is entirely wrong. Where the capsuleers use
    a form of cloning and personality transfer that approaches perfection in its suitability
    for the vast expanses of space, the immortal soldiers use a technology that we
    might describe as almost parochial were it not so clearly advanced and carrying
    with it obvious situational advantages. A capsuleer killed out of her capsule
    might die permanently, and if not, she will lose much time in the gap between
    her backup\u2019s creation and her new cloning. A mercenary clone fears no such
    hiatus or loss, so long as he is within transmission range of a clone reanimation
    unit (CRU) or a mobile command center (MCC).\n\nOn the other hand, the mercenary
    clone is limited by considerations of transmission range. It has been established
    that the personality-transfer technology does not use quantum entanglement. A
    supersoldier who is accidentally abandoned on a planet for five years is in dire
    circumstances, because the life span of a mercenary clone\u2019s body is apparently
    no longer than that. He will die and lose five years of his life. Still, he will
    return, because his core personality data is held in the vast databanks of his
    corporation\u2019s infrastructure. He may even have been assumed killed in action
    and reanimated into a new clone the day after being marooned, a rather undesirable
    eventuality that would end up essentially creating a second copy of the individual
    soldier.\n\nThe important point to realize about the immortal soldiers and the
    capsuleers is that they are very different beings indeed. They may both be infomorphs
    of a kind, but those kinds are distinct. The capsuleers re-create themselves in
    full, or at least as close as possible, every time they clone. Every scrap of
    neural data, every linkage in the structure of their brains, is transferred and
    reproduced anew. They crave the authenticity of the experience; any fleeting breaks
    in their consciousnesses are generally dismissed as unimportant.\n\n![Clone Warrior](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/59HYaC4DqjEc8Rbe5imyNu/4a18d4d84806f97ccb46f7108d9908c2/The_mercenary2.png)\n\nThe
    mercenary is different entirely. His brain structure has been altered to serve
    the needs of the cloning technology. His entire personality and essential being
    is shifted out of that brain\u2014which has been rearranged heavily to act as
    a hybrid of primal being and highly efficient control system\u2014and into an
    entirely digital existence within the neuro-interface socket (NIS) at the back
    of the neck. The information stored in this personality stack is everything that
    makes him who he is as a clone trooper. Everything else has long since been abandoned.\n\nWhen
    the mercenary is killed, his NIS has only to transmit the new data that is not
    stored back at the CRU and MCC banks. In effect, it is a kind of personality data
    difference file. A powerful burst transmission suffices to update the core stacks.
    The range of this transmission is debated, but it is certainly no more than orbital,
    roughly speaking\u2014a far, far cry from the theoretically unlimited range of
    capsuleer quantum entanglement. The radically different nature and scope of personality
    transmission for the capsuleer and the mercenary should at once be noted. There
    is no sense in which a capsuleer can seamlessly transfer to a mercenary clone,
    or vice versa. The very act would immediately make the receiving vessel into a
    different person. It would, as the technologies presently operate, be an inevitable
    forking of personality into two distinct beings.\n\nThe recent union of the capsuleer
    and the clone soldier has sent shock waves through the old empires\u2019 political
    establishment. These millennia-old power structures, which have ruled the star
    cluster since time immemorial, are gradually realizing that despite the wisdom
    and respect it bestows, venerable age also carries with it stagnation and decay."

    Divine, and so the*\n>*glory of our faith is inherent to us all;*\n>*When thine
    heart shines with the Light, thou*\n>*shalt know no hardship;*\n>*When thine actions
    are in Light\u2019s name, thou art immortal.*\n> \u2014The Book of Trials, 2:1\n\nIt
    began with inmate 487980-A, a man of Caldari descent and a prisoner held at Imperial
    Corrections Penitentiary 89 in the Hedion system of the Amarrian throne worlds.\n\nPreviously
    known as Vincent Barabin, a wanted fugitive within the state and former Caldari
    Navy serviceman, he became known simply as Templar One after becoming the first
    of a select group of Imperial Paladins commissioned by Amarrian Empress Jamyl
    Sarum: immortal transhuman warriors, infused with the latest technology, destined
    to join capsuleers among the small elite of society, becoming part of those select
    few with the ability to cheat death.\n\nBased on a biomechanical implant colloquially
    known as \u201Cfifth lobe technology,\u201D harvested from a dormant race known
    only as \u201CSleepers,\u201D the highly invasive surgical process to transform
    an individual into one of these paladins was described by imperial scientists
    as one of the most brutal procedures that they had ever carried out, with a recovery
    procedure lasting several months.\n\nDespite operating in breach of the CONCORD
    Assembly\u2019s legislation regarding the cloning of sentient biomasses, these
    first-generation cloned mercenaries were initially used to great effect during
    the battle of Pike\u2019s Landing in the republic system of Amamake. However,
    the vast majority were both mentally and physically unable to adjust to such severe
    changes in physiology, and many were driven mad by the drastic changes made to
    their physical and mental composition.\n\nThe Amarr Empire, fearful of a potential
    insurrection by these powerful soldiers, decided to resolve both the issue of
    their presence and the evidence of their existence in one fell swoop. An order
    was issued for an Imperial Navy strike force to carry out a full-scale orbital
    bombardment of both the battlefield at Pike\u2019s Landing and the central clone
    reanimation unit enclave in order to ensure that no evidence of what was now considered
    a failed experiment would exist, should the CONCORD Assembly investigate. The
    order was carried out with success, and to this day the fate of Templar One remains
    a mystery to all who knew of his existence.\n\nFor a while the project was believed
    to be a thing of the past. However, within a number of months, imperial scientists,
    under a decree issued by Empress Jamyl herself, had completed work on an artificially
    synthesized version of the implant, grown directly inside a human clone and free
    from the invasive procedures of the first-generation implants. With the ability
    to bypass the lengthy recovery process, the empire set about creating a stock
    of second-generation cloned soldiers. Within several months more, this technology
    had spread to the other core empires, with all four major powers working on their
    own answer to the empire\u2019s new discovery.\n\n![Air Land Warfare](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/1pzxvw808hhGJM3edqy21g/dbb42e8c360fcd85ad3475e3d88e28af/breaking_chains_1.png)\n\nIt
    was not until November 30, YC 114, that the true power of these new cloned soldiers
    was revealed, after Tibus Heth, executor of the Caldari State, was shot by an
    assailant at a Provist political rally in the city of Okushin on New Caldari Prime.
    It was rumored that this single individual, later revealed to be a clone soldier,
    dispatched over a dozen of Heth\u2019s most highly trained Provist bodyguards
    in hand-to-hand combat before being subdued by a squad of over thirty security
    staff.\n\nUpon his recovery, on January 28, YC 115, Heth ordered a purge of all
    cloned mercenary enclaves in the Caldari State, which triggered genocide of indescribable
    proportions against cloned mercenaries. Both Mordu\u2019s Legion Command and the
    Guristas Pirates, as well as the Angel Cartel and the Serpentis Corporation, offered
    aid to displaced mercenaries, with both the Legion and the Guristas breaching
    the state\u2019s borders to airlift besieged personnel from the surface of various
    planets in Caldari sovereign territory. The Amarr Empire also offered sanctuary
    to these displaced mercenaries, taking in thousands who flocked across the border
    to safety.\n\nBy mid-March of YC 115, Gallente president Jacus Roden and Sanmatar
    Maleatu Shakor of the republic both also ordered the destruction of their mercenary
    enclaves. This was prior to the outbreak of hostilities on Caldari Prime, which
    then saw thousands of the now-displaced mercenaries\u2014still illegal and unrecognized
    entities in the eyes of CONCORD\u2014flooding to the system of Luminaire in order
    to work as hired guns in the conflict that erupted.\n\nBy proving themselves on
    the battlefield, and in subsequent evaluation during investigations into the Luminaire
    carnage, this new breed of mercenary, by sheer numbers and power alone, effectively
    forced the CONCORD Assembly\u2019s hand into ratifying them as a legal entity
    with the Directive Enforcement Department\u2019s Mercenary Infomorph Act, released
    on May 14, YC 115. This legislation ushered in a new era for the cloned mercenary,
    and indeed for New Eden, causing the widespread legalized construction of mercenary
    enclaves and the revision of the CONCORD Emergency Militia War Powers Act to include
    the ability for cloned mercenaries to fight as independents on behalf of the sovereign
    militias. Coupled with this, the Mercenary Infomorph Act also gifted a status
    similar to that of the capsuleer to the cloned mercenaries, effectively billing
    them as independent political entities in their own right.\n\nWhile immense differences
    exist between capsuleers and mercenaries, this does not prohibit their cooperation
    in both war and infrastructure construction. As of late YC 115, many political,
    military, and scientific analysts are asking questions about the future of the
    CONCORD Assembly, and whether they would indeed be able to repel a focused assault
    from a combined force of immortal pilots and soldiers. The future remains more
    uncertain now than it ever has been, as immortals both on the ground and among
    the stars begin their first movements in a new arena of power politics.\n"

    do not stop them from working together in war, industry, and even science. In
    this latter connection, the combination of these two classes of immortal may eventually
    prove the most dangerous. It is certain that each group wishes to expand its respective
    power and that each understands the essential connection between its power and
    its nascent immortality. If that immortality can be made ever more concrete, then
    that power will increase immeasurably. We should be wary of this, those of us
    who count ourselves mortal, those of us who love other mortals. The future for
    all of us who live in New Eden is more uncertain than it has ever been, as today
    mortals and immortals dance around one another in mutual distrust.*\n> \n>\u2014

    Dark Horizons\n\nWith a subject as significant and controversial as military cloning,
    a certain degree of rumor and speculation is unavoidable. Though such talk covers
    a broad spectrum of plausibility, most of it is fairly obvious hearsay and thus
    easily dismissed by a discerning listener. One rumor, however, has recently taken
    flight in the wake of a series of strange events that appear to lend it some authority.\n\nFor
    some years, capsuleer trainees all over New Eden have been dropping out of their
    programs in ever-increasing numbers and disappearing off the radar completely,
    often stealing highly specialized equipment in the process. While the phenomenon
    of last-second cold feet is a known factor in capsuleer training, the pervasiveness
    and uniformity of these larcenous vanishing acts is a growing cause for concern
    among the four empires\u2019 educational institutions.\n\nThough not an insignificant
    problem, this in and of itself did not cause a particular stir until a Caldari
    investigative journalist uncovered evidence that one of the missing capsuleer
    trainees had been identified as the pilot of an experimental fighter shot down
    by a Caldari Navy interceptor squad on scouting duty in the Tribute region. Upon
    inspection of his corpse, it was discovered that the pilot in question appeared
    to have had significant neural modifications made, the purpose and methodology
    of which left scientists scratching their heads in bafflement. Furthermore, the
    brain showed an unnatural smoothness in its ridges, a telltale sign that its electrochemical
    charges had been scanned. Whether this was done as a security measure or for the
    purposes of an actual mind transfer has not been determined.\n\nThe week after,
    a very similar incident took place in Minmatar territory, with more soon following
    all over New Eden. Amid growing concern for their capsuleer hopefuls, training
    facilities tightened their security measures, but to no avail: the siphoning of
    valuable talent continued unabated. When the investigative journalist revealed
    evidence that indicated the first pilot\u2019s vessel was of Guristas design,
    she was determined to find the truth of the matter. Undercover, she set out for
    a Guristas outpost where shipbuilding and engineering were rumored to take top
    priority. She has not been heard from since. Still today, rumors persist that
    someone, somewhere, in the shadow of a blood moon, is working on a breakthrough
    that will shake up the world of New Eden yet again. \n"
