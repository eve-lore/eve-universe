- body: 'Damella Macaper was a [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) astronomer who lived
    a century ago. She wrote a book called "The Seven Events of

    the Apocalypse" in which she prophesied the end of the world.


    Damella was not taken seriously by her peers; they described her as a "hack" and
    a "nutcase", and her book was largely ignored except by a small cult following.
    She died shortly after her book was published and as a result, the cult dwindled
    rapidly.
