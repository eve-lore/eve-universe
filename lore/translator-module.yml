    language to the next. While generally flawless when used with the

    primary languages of [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk), they can

    have trouble with some older tongues.


    Technology

    ----------


    The unique nature of the [capsule](capsule-lore) with its

    sophisticated neural rigging gives ship captains the option to link

    their minds to all kinds of computer systems. One of these is the

    translator module, a standard software bundle featured in all capsules

    that allows pod pilots to communicate effortlessly with each other in

    their own preferred language.


    Development

    -----------


    Early translation protocols were limited to text input and often

    produced inaccurate results. Current versions, on the other hand, can

    translate voice and text input and are able to handle slang and accents

    as well as anticipate mood swings.


    With the steady increase in cyber-implants these translators have begun

    appearing outside the capsule as well and many predict that within a few

    years translators will make the debate over which language should

    prevail in inter-racial communication a futile one.


    Effects on inter-racial communication

    -------------------------------------


    As [cyber implants](6gvL4Ytgm3vJN7gvP6akTd) become more common,

    use of translator modules outside the capsule has increased, a

    development expected to reduce and eventually eliminate the need for

    interpreters in inter-racial communications. The question of which

    empire language should be officially recognized will eventually also

    become moot.
