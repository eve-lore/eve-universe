- body: "Karin Midular was the former Prime Minister of the [Minmatar Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp).
    She was known for her peaceful politics and support for domestic cooperation with
    the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo), variously interpreted as intelligent
    caution, cowardly appeasement, or outright treason. She was replaced by Sanmatar
    [Malaetu Shakor](3H5EVyO9kiyIUOEELIqOlV) following the events of the [Elder War](1AY43ZRuiApjXZuVWCllzV).
    Her death after injuries sustained in a mass-shooting perpetrated by Gerne Broteau
    resulted in tensions between the previously aligned Minmatar and [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK).\n\n###
    Early Life\n\nKarin was born a slave-child in YC56 but smuggled out of Amarr space
    by her parents, who remained as slaves. She never knew them. Karin was raised
    in Mithuris in Matar's Mikramurka Steppes by [her tribe](1fNour0sFTIcCFRVQM2pro),
    which had been identified, but her clan remained a mystery. Until her adolescence,
    when she received her [Voluval mark](13zCA6nzp0NyZy5x434r1M), she was referred
    to only by her first name. \n\nShe chose to be adopted by the Midular clan and
    wear their motif shortly after receiving her distinctive mark as a sign of respect
    for her Midular essence instructor, Vormar. She carries the Ray of Matar - a very
    rare Mark of great destiny and leadership. Many of those that underwent the Test
    of Destiny with Midular, including High Justice Mattmar Graur, speak of her solemnity
    even as a youth, as well as the desire she expressed to unite all Minmatar. Graur
    states that she attracted some derision when she spoke of the [Ammatar](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz)
    in particular and how they would one day be reunited with the other tribes. \n\n>
    \ She spoke of a need for leadership from an early age, and while her heart was
    in the right place, she could be na\xEFve.\n\nAcademically brilliant, Midular
    pursued engineering upon entering Republic University after achieving outstanding
    results in the sciences. Despite the voluval mark she received at age 16 and the
    calls for her to pursue her destiny in leadership, for many years her focus was
    on the starship propulsion systems used by the Republic Fleet. Her senior dissertation
    on graduating focused on research being done on plasma propulsion systems instead
    of nuclear technology, a treatise that was seen as idealistic in YC 78, but nevertheless
    gained her esteem among her technically minded brethren. Keen to capitalize on
    the young theorist\u2019s fame, she was hired right out of university by Core
    Complexion and soon became their Chief Researcher. Her singular task in this role
    was the coordination of large scale research projects that would serve as the
    foundation for the development of the plasma thruster decades later. This breakthrough,
    assisted in no small way by what the Republic would later obtain from the [Crielere
    Project](3Y34ZySL2hebLjco1Y25IK), went on to become a vital component in the manufacture
    of ships and propulsion units in the Republic fleet. Midular was not involved
    in this final development however, as her career had already taken her in another
    direction. \n\n### A Moderate Negotiator\n\nKarin Midular may have joined Core
    Complexion as a researcher but her natural skills as a mediator and her ability
    to discuss practical and scientific advances knowledgeably meant she quickly became
    the public face of the corporation. For almost 20 years Midular met with researchers
    both inside and outside Republic space, forging many of the alliances that still
    exist to this day, particularly with contacts in the Gallente Federation. She
    also garnered a reputation as a peacekeeper within Core Complexion whenever tribal
    grudges interfered with large scale projects or the smooth operation of the corporation\u2019s
    interests. Her intercession in YC92 in a dispute that threatened to become a long-standing
    legal battle between unions that would reach outside the walls of Core Complexion
    ended in success. She was the principle negotiator sent in by Core Complexion
    in their efforts to expand into Amarr territory and personally met with [Doriam
    Kor-Azor](1aaBMbCysLA8uJjQQczFwT) before his ascension and the Emperor at the
    time, [Heideran VII](4Olxc4nxWd7y1mjFPhvHnV). While it was anticipated she would
    have limited success, to the amazement of many, Midular emerged from closed door
    meetings having managed to secure orbital assets in Genesis, Kor Azor and even
    Domain. Fresh from these successful negotiations she returned to the Republic
    and almost immediately announced her intention to enter the political arena. For
    many Sebiestor this was the news they had always hoped for from their Ray of Matar
    but for the other tribes the fact that she was doing so after she had spent time
    working closely with the Amarr on Core Complexion\u2019s behalf led to initial
    suspicions as to what had prompted the decision. \n\n### A Campaign of Peace\n\nMidular
    started writing to existing delegates and senators asking for a cessation of the
    hostilities in the Vindication Wars and in a move that didn\u2019t ingratiate
    her in political circles, began sharing sections of the discourse she was having
    when she dealt with the press. After years of closed doors and militaristic action,
    the Matari people responded positively and she assumed the role of Sebiestor Tribal
    Chief in YC 97 with almost unanimous support. Taking this backing as a mandate
    to act on the message of peace she had started promoting in her campaign, one
    of her first acts was to suggest the withdrawal of Sebiestor forces from the conflicts
    in Ammatar space. While this was popular amongst her own people it was met with
    mixed responses from the other tribes, particularly from the Brutor and Krusual,
    who lambasted her for the \u201Ccowardly\u201D suggestion. She used the vitriol
    to her advantage, comparing it to the vindictive nature of the military actions
    being taken in Derelik against \u201Cour wayward brothers and sisters\u201D and
    the belligerence and warmongering that she intended to put an end to. After over
    a hundred years there was a general fatigue amongst the voting public concerning
    the increasingly bitter civil war in Derelik. She had been in the position of
    Tribal Chief for only six months before she was using the momentum her peaceful
    position was generating to announce her intention to head straight into the Ministerial
    election race. Whilst she did not win in her most immediate run for office her
    approval climbed, reaching a pinnacle on the eve of the YC 102 election, notably
    against the backdrop of the Battle of Tears, which was raging in the Sasta and
    Tanoo systems. In her inaugural address as Prime Minister she announced the official
    end of direct hostilities against the Ammatar in an attempt to usher in a \u201Cnew
    era of peace and prosperity for a united and strengthened Minmatar Republic\u201D.
    \n\nMidular\u2019s campaign had also centered around her belief that the survival
    of the Minmatar people was depended on the success of the Republic parliamentary
    system that had been established. Her knowledge and cordial relations with the
    Gallente during her time with Core Complexion meant that she was familiar with
    the basis on which the Republic had been formed. She was an advocate of democracy,
    and her political career was devoted to promotion of a progressive agenda for
    the Minmatar that borrowed a great deal of its principles from the Federation.
    \n\nOverall, her public appearances before the election attracted record crowds
    and audiences throughout New Eden. She was a natural before the cameras, knew
    how to craft an official statement and frequently gave personal opinions that
    to many seemed realistic, rational and honest. Ultimately, while the public adored
    her as she represented moderation and the promise of political change; she did
    not earn the respect of all of the tribes leadership, some of whom still desired
    revenge against both the Ammatar and their Amarr masters. Karin Midular\u2019s
    heart was understood to be in the right place, and it got her into office, but
    she was already perceived to be too much of an idealist amongst those already
    in power. In the years to come, hampered by bureaucracy and corruption, a series
    of policy failures led to the slow decay of her popularity.\n\n### A Slow Decline\n\nIn
    February of YC106 Midular attracted negative press when she decided to pen a controversial
    motion for the removal of the [Khumaak](4ivJZ5FQKTtduznzfOVMmn), an ornamental
    weapon, from the list of sanctioned Minmatar state, military and fleet apparel.
    This led to harsh exchanges, most notably between Karin Midular and the Krusual
    Tribe Leader, Tenerhaddi Dykon. The situation became so tense that Republic Security
    Services changed the severity category of tribal gathering halls to prevent the
    possibility of violence. Maleatu Shakor referred to the inefficiency of \u201Cformalized
    bickering\u201D over supreme executive authority in response to events, establishing
    the sort of belligerence that he would go on to demonstrate throughout Midular\u2019s
    presidency. \n\nIn response to the tensions Minmatar began wearing replica khumaak
    in public and organized protests that necessitated police intervention. Sales
    of the replicas skyrocketed, and holoreel director Jarol Brint\u2019s twelve-year
    old fictional account of the events on Ezzara VI, _The Fire of a Nation_, enjoyed
    a resurgence in popularity that saw it returning to theaters across the Republic
    again. \n\nThings took a turn for the worse when an explosive device was defused
    at the Sebiestor Tribe\u2019s regional headquarters in Houdea and a rally was
    organized demanding that Midular explain her motives to her people. \n\nEventually
    a modification of the original proposal was put forward by the Brutor Tribe that
    stipulated that the khumaak was not to be displayed at specific public gatherings,
    particularly those that would involve contact with Amarr dignitaries. Senior councilman
    Bolwin Amrisar resigned shortly after this motion was passed, stating that Karin
    Midular had been pulling strings for so long she\u2019d forgotten about political
    process. \n\nThe events marked the beginning of a slow decline in the previously
    unanimous support that Midular had gained amongst her tribesmen and exposed the
    belief that had long been simmering \u2013 that Midular was making deals sympathetic
    to the desires of the Amarr. While accusations concerning the restriction of the
    khumaak in particular were dismissed, Karin Midular did state publicly that she
    would \u201Cdo what is best for my people, in any way I can.\u201D\n\nSuspicion
    as to Midular\u2019s motives had grown and were only exacerbated two months later
    when she dramatically condemned the assassination of Doriam II, whom she had worked
    with during her time in Core Complexion.  It was noted that she referred to a
    \u201Crising tide of violence and mistrust\u201D, cryptically referring to those
    that questioned her apparent connections with the Amarr.  There were also rumors
    that a working Insorum prototype had been developed but was deliberately being
    withheld from distribution, increasing dependence on current stocks of a more
    temporary Vitoc antidote.  All in all, more had begun to whisper behind closed
    doors and deliberately start to erode faith in the Ray of Matar.\n\n### Exodus
    to Gallente Space\n\nThe Federation Year 107 Census Index revealed a sevenfold
    inflation of the number of Matari immigrating into Federation-controlled regions.
    An investigation conducted by the University of Caille resulted in a warning to
    Midular\u2019s cabinet that they may be facing a possible exodus from the Republic.
    This information was soon leaked to the media from within parliament, and the
    reasons that were quoted included increasing economic stagnation, rising unemployment
    and a concomitant increase in the influence of organized crime \u2013 particularly
    the [Angel Cartel](3p6aB4GMbVdMUEVYOb3kF0). Polling in the core of the Federation
    by the University of Caille had revealed that Minmatar expatriates stated that
    their main reason for leaving was a general dissatisfaction with the disunity
    perceived amongst Republic leaders. Trar Odemenko, Chief Spokesman for the Association
    of Matari Expatriates (AME) in Darpagne on Renyn IV, was approached by the media
    and revealed that tribal discord was evident everywhere. Violent exchanges amongst
    the members of the different tribes was attributed to a weakened Republic identity
    and council members more interested in competing with each other than focusing
    on domestic issues that were requiring more attention.  \n\nMidular chose not
    to respond to the study directly but instead focused on job creation to address
    the heart of the matter. She spoke with members of the mining industry in particular
    in light of the increasing activity in the sector with recent open access to the
    Fenrir and ORE\u2019s release of exhumers months afterwards. Research and development
    corporations also cried out for enterprising minds to help it in the race to keep
    up with the other empires in the development of capital ships and technology,
    and were given government grants to pursue their work with the understanding that
    the jobs created would be offered to Minmatar within Gallente space to entice
    them back to Republic worlds, stemming the tide of expatriation. The move proved
    successful, helped in no small part by the increasing demand for cooperation with
    capsuleers seeking more lucrative contracts with corporate agents and industrial
    support for the construction of their own starbases. Research and development
    labs across New Eden had also opened their arms to the capsuleer community, who
    were of course interested in the technological advancements being made and sought
    to use their facilities. For almost two years, due to the potential increase in
    economic activity, approval for Midular\u2019s cabinet stabilized, and even looked
    set for an upswing in popularity. An immediate solution was far off, however,
    and a series of conflicts that followed was to lead to calls for Midular\u2019s
    resignation and even assassination.\n\n### Karishal Muritor and the Ushra\u2019Khan\n\nShortages
    in the Republic started to result in varied misconduct, provoking conflicts with
    authorities that was exemplified in the fall from grace of a decorated Republic
    Fleet captain. Despite the foundations being laid down, Matari industrial complexes
    near the Republic-Federation border ground to a halt due to labor shortages, particularly
    in the Eugidi and Barvigrard constellations. The Minmatar Mining Corporation was
    especially hard hit and had to shut down two facilities in Uttindar. Coordinator
    Marerlur Simnika spoke of up to three quarters of staff previously located there
    vanishing into the Federation. The exodus was echoed by Sirfortur Ofarter of Boundless
    Creation. The knock-on effect meant a slowing of production and delivery which,
    coupled with a mutation of the Vitoc toxin, led to a shortage of a viable antidote,
    particularly in the Edmalbrurdus system. Gallente and Minmatar senators and aide
    workers testified as to the suffering and eventual long-term repercussions of
    the shortage.\n\nTwo days after this news, Amarrian Holder Jamir Torash was travelling
    from his homeworld in Chaven and on course for Geth when he found himself under
    attack by pilots of the Minmatar capsuleer collective known as the Ushra\u2019Khan
    in Hibi. The two haulers in his convoy were carrying five thousand m3 of Vitoc,
    which was jettisoned. Despite the cargo being the presumed purpose of the assault,
    Lord Torash and his escorts were also destroyed.\n\nThese incidents served as
    the catalyst for increased confrontations between the two empires, and amongst
    the conflicts emerged the revered Karishal Muritor, a captain in the Republic
    Fleet.  As a result of an expressed desire to increase military action in response
    to insurgent and criminal groups within the, Muritor was actually suspended from
    duty after defying his superiors Minmatar territories.\n\nOn the 7th June, YC108,
    the Alfhild, a Hel-class supercarrier, was reported stolen or missing after an
    unscheduled jump from its docking premises along with its escorts. Earlier in
    the week this same fleet, along with Captain Muritor, had failed to attend the
    inauguration ceremony of Amarr holder Gavit Torash, acting as the Republic Parliament
    representative\u2019s honour escort. It was soon revealed that the decorated captain
    had absconded with the ship, and in a broadcast from Odatrik, revealed that he
    had formed a group known as the Defiants, intending to strike at the Amarr. Throughout
    Matari territories, Karin Midular found herself once again faced with the warmongering
    of her people as they posted up pictures of Muritor and echoed calls for hostilities
    against the Empire. Muritor made an incendiary statement from the Alfhild in Odatrik,
    also galvanizing people against Midular\u2019s government.\n\n> If you would stand
    before me and call this state of affairs in which we are held right and true,
    then I am sure that it is better for me and my men to fight and die without any
    right than to live in such a lie.\n\nIt moved the Ushra'Khan enough that they
    retaliated for an attack in April against a \"Minmatar Cultural Education Center\",
    and the Port Redemption slave facility was destroyed in the Sahtogas system, owned
    by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Slaves (SPCS), a subsidiary of
    PIE Inc.  Both Empires were getting increasingly cagey. With Amarr increasing
    patrols along the border in response to Muritor\u2019s incitement and the attacks
    that followed, and with the possibility that this figure had the potential to
    divide not only Minmatar but the authority of the Republic Fleet after her attempts
    to unite the people, the prime minister had no choice but to act. Karin Midular\u2019s
    cabinet declared Karishal Muritor an outlaw.\n\n### One ISK for Midular\n\nAfter
    being pursued for a time, Karishal Muritor agreed to talk with Republic Fleet
    Admiral Kanth Filmir, an old friend of his who had been tasked with bringing him
    in. They met near Planet X in the Auga system. Under banner of truce Filmir tried
    to communicate Midular\u2019s request that Muritor desist in his hostilities against
    the Amarr. When he refused, Filmir deployed a strike force. \n\nMembers of the
    Ushra\u2019Khan that were present started to attack the Republic Fleet in defense
    of the Defiant leader, but Muritor called them off, himself refusing to attack
    Filmir\u2019s fleet. Before Muritor\u2019s ship exploded, his last words asked
    those assembled that they \u201CDo not forget what we achieved with so few. Do
    not forget.\u201D\n\nMidular\u2019s cabinet subsequently claimed responsibility
    for the death of Karishal Muritor, carried out on the 1st of February YC109. In
    response, the Ushra\u2019Khan declared Karin Midular their number one enemy, placing
    a 1 ISK bounty on her head. Their hero lost, many Matari declared their intention
    to claim the bounty.\n\nOn March 5th YC109 around 2 million Matari packed into
    the main promenade of Matari Prime for what was to become known as the \u201COne
    ISK for Midular\u201D protest. Organized by the \u201CVoices of Matar\u201D party,
    who were new to the political arena, the movements ranks had swelled alongside
    membership of the Bloody Hands in response to the handling of Captain Muritor
    and the dismissal of recent riots. People in the crowd painted their faces with
    crimson handprints.\n\nAs if Midular\u2019s popularity had not plummeted enough,
    in April it was discovered that she was having secret meetings with representatives
    of the Ammatar Mandate regarding a potential reconciliation. When this was revealed,
    Midular made a statement to an increasingly hostile people, asking them to rise
    above their hatred for the tribe that had betrayed them and remained a bitter
    enemy in the Vindication Wars \u2013 a conflict that Midular herself had worked
    to end.  Despite her plea, at 22:50 on the 24th of May YC109 an explosion rocked
    the Republic Parliament station orbiting the gas giant, Egbonbet VI. The blast
    killed one of the Ammatar Mandate consulate members that were gathered there to
    continue their talks with the Republic. The remaining Ammatar fled under the protection
    of capsuleer corporation Delictum 23216, who it was revealed had been providing
    security since the talks had begun. The Bloody Hands claimed responsibility for
    the explosion. Channels for diplomacy remained open but were now fragile in light
    of the explosion that it was announced had killed 42 people. Parliament responded
    by tasking Republic Security Services with tracking down members of the Bloody
    Hands.\n\nFocus on communication with the Ammatar, and Amarr themselves, had always
    been an issue but was now becoming particularly vilified. Dubbed the \u2018Overlord\u2019s
    Pet\u2019, she soon began receiving belligerent animosity during session. Suspicions
    as to her sympathies for the traditional enemy that had been exacerbated in the
    past by her statement in response to the assassination of Doriam II in YC107,
    at this point in her career were strengthened by her, conversely, measured reaction
    to the attempt made on Karsoth in YC110. In a much more careful response, Midular
    used the occasion to instead express her desire to \u201Cmaintain lines of dialogue\u201D
    with Amarr despite everything that was happening.\n\nAs if the mood in parliament
    wasn\u2019t tense enough, Shakor caused some controversy and returned focus to
    the issues plaguing Republic cabinet by wishing the Ushra\u2019khan luck in the
    upcoming Alliance tournament, despite their calls for Midular\u2019s assassination.
    While they subsequently lost, it didn\u2019t go unnoticed how many Matari were
    still supporting their efforts.\n\nOn the 8th of May YC110 Midular announced the
    appointment of [Keitan Yun](7GwmdZZWDXWHLHEaUmQUSX) as the nation\u2019s ambassador
    to CONCORD. This served to provide an image of unity in the halls of parliament,
    especially when Shakor endorsed the decision but nevertheless remained critical
    of Midular.\n\n### Skarkon and Confidence in Midular\u2019s Leadership\n\nOrganised
    crime was rife near the end of Midular\u2019s time in office, dominated by the
    activities of the Angel Cartel in the Republic\u2019s Territories. This was particularly
    true of the Skarkon system. The Republic government was considered a dangerously
    ineffective machine, and in light of that this system endorsed a succession from
    her governance.\n\nThe Archangels \u2013 namely Tabe Rajus - sent her a communiqu\xE9
    advising that at 19:00 local time the Skarkon system would be transferred to their
    sovereignty, and that news of this transfer would be passed onto the media with
    the electronic signatures of 10 million Skarkon residents. Ships entering the
    system after receipt of the communiqu\xE9 would be fired upon unless there was
    a concession of the transfer of sovereignty, or Midular herself made a public
    apology for her slandering of the cartel. Shortly after this message was received,
    Karin was informed that the system was blockaded. Republic Fleet ships attempted
    to clear them from the system, but quickly ceased fire when it was clear that
    the cartel would be using civilian barges for shielding. Capsuleers continued
    to engage them regardless, but the Republics attempts were halted.\n\nWhile the
    situation itself was dire, it was the fact that citizens in the system endorsed
    what was occurring that really crushed Karin Midular. Residents of Skarkon had
    effectively stated that they had more faith in pirates than her parliament.\n\nWhile
    in session attempting to resolve the situation, Keitun Yun suggested that it be
    made clear that the Republic did not negotiate with terrorists and Midular threw
    him out. Shortly afterwards she was presented with a news report broadcasting
    the fact that Starkmanir had been found on Halturzhan, the 6th planet in the Jarizza
    system, living amongst the Nefantar.\n\nShakor entered a heated session parliament
    shortly thereafter and demanded a vote of no confidence in Midular. Karin was
    devastated. Not only was she facing many crises at once, she had now effectively
    been stripped of the executive powers that would allow her to order any use of
    force to resolve the situation in Skarkon. Her government was slipping through
    her fingers.\n\n### The Elder War\n\nCONCORD contacted Midular at this time to
    inform her that they had just been threatened by Keitun Yun with the backing of
    an enormous fleet of Minmatar ships that had appeared in Yulai. In no uncertain
    terms they implied that that she had lost control of her people, and needed to
    act. Her first reaction at the end of the call was to ask that the media not get
    a hold of what was transpiring. CONCORD advised her that it was already too late
    before they ended the call. Shortly thereafter she entered parliament and used
    the constitution to dissolve the current government and call for elections in
    two months. \n\nThe parliament descended into chaos. As Midular prepared to leave
    parliament, two guards entered her office intent on assaulting her. She was rescued
    by Keitan Yun and an assembled unit of troops working on behalf of the Elders,
    who proceeded to murder all those in the Republic Parliament that had been identified
    as agents of Karsoth. Evidence of their duplicity was left on their bodies.\n\nAt
    the same time, the Elder War was taking place in Amarr as three enormous fleet's
    that Midular had no previous knowledge of starting invading the Empire seeking
    to liberate as many slaves as possible. Despite all her attempt to seek peace,
    and the apparent support of her people, at the first sign of war many deserted
    their posts or emerged to fight alongside an unsanctioned invasion force. \n\nDespite
    their intervention and timely intercession in her assault it was suggested that
    the forces of the Elders were less than sympathetic to her cause and considered
    Midular\u2019s ministerial record a failure to promote unity among the remnants
    of the tribes, though she recognised only that her parliament had been compromised
    and hindered in its ability to act. She was particularly hostile towards Shakor,
    who became Sanmatar in the wake of her parliament's collapse, as it had been he
    who had protected the Elder Fleet by focusing attention on the politics of the
    Republic itself, at times fostering a belligerence that undermined Midular\u2019s
    efforts at appeasement.\n\n### Events on Gallente Prime\n\nAt 11.57, 11th of April
    YC115, while attending a Gallente-Minmatar cultural festival, Karin Midular was
    amongst an assembled crowd that was attacked by a lone gunman. Detonating explosives
    and then opening fire on attendees at the Luminaire Center for Culture and The
    Arts in Caille, the terrorist killed 58 and wounded 304 of those attending the
    inaugural address of the Federal Tribes Festival of Community and Culture. While
    the identity of the victims were not initially released it soon came to light
    that Karin Midular was one of the dignitaries wounded, receiving a head wound
    that resulted in her being hospitalized in a critical condition. Sanmatar Shakor
    called for the immediate extradition of the shooter for questioning and trial
    in the Minmatar territories, and the population also called for the return of
    the Ray of Matar, to be cared for in the Republic. Unfortunately, Gallente doctors
    revealed that she was in a medically induced coma due to extensive brain trauma,
    and travel was impossible.\n\nThis situation led to a face off between the Republic
    and Federation as well as reports of increasing tension between Minmatar residents
    of Gallente space and the culture that housed them, as well as increasing tensions
    amongst the Matari tribes. [Vuld Haupt](1clrLuFFV50EpAEzxYx6Zt), religious leader
    of the Sebiestor, called for unity and asked that it be recognised that Midular
    had lived up to her promise as the Ray of Matar, laying the foundations for a
    Republic where all the tribes stood together.\n\nMidular was later transferred
    to the Republic after showing signs that she was stabilizing. Despite emergency
    surgery, however, Midular later died from her injuries. In response, requests
    for her killer to be transferred transformed into demands, to the point that 15
    Naglafar-class dreadnoughts of the Republic Fleet circumvented cynosural blockers
    in Colelie and jumped their fleet into the system in a show of force. The Gallente
    responded almost immediately, at which point Admiral Leralduin Olf, leading the
    Republic Fleet, requested passage to retrieve the shooter responsible for the
    death of the Ray of Matar. Admiral Stolle Colalle, commanding the Federation\u2019s
    forces, refused the request and declared the Republic\u2019s actions a act of
    war. Hundreds of capsuleers appeared on the scene, attempting to either calm the
    situation or inflame it. Eventually the Republic Fleet opened fire and the one
    time allies traded dreadnoughts in a heated exchange until the Federation eventually
    destroyed the Minmatar, who fought to the last. Enraged Minmatar capsuleers attempted
    to continue the fight but were dispersed with the arrival of DED Officer Odo Korachi.
    The incident prompted an emergency session amidst the Federation, with President
    Roden stating that the Gallente were committed to peace.\n\n### A Chief's Funeral\n\n>
    \u201C\u2018Maybe my mountain will crumble, but I got to the top, as I set out
    to do; I fulfilled my dream.\u2019 the Rock righteously said to the Mountain.\u201D
    \n\nDespite originally denying the request for the extradition of the shooter
    - at which point the Sebiestor Tribe indicated that they would monitor the culprits
    trial - the incident in Colelie and the subsequent rise in ethnic violence against
    Minmatar in Federation space brought new focus to the situation amongst the Gallente.
    Eyes in the Republic turned to the Great Caravanserai on Matar where, for the
    month of June, Sebiestor in particular could pay their respects to the Ray of
    Matar, lain in repose. Later the same day the Caille District Court sentenced
    Broteau to twelve consecutive life sentences for the shooting before they indicated
    their intention to hand him over to the Sebiestor Tribal Court for trial over
    the murder of the tribal chief, a move that was seen as a significant step in
    preserving the alliance between the two allied empires. \n\nBroteau\u2019s trial
    and subsequent execution were swift, much to the dismay of the Federation, despite
    their act of goodwill in turning over the shooter regardless of the Republic\u2019s
    belligerence in Colelie. Shakor was quick to point out that he had already been
    trialed and convicted in Caille, and the Sebiestor were only confirming the findings
    and applying the punishment that best fit their own laws. The Tribal Council later
    denied permission for a senatorial delegation from the Federation to attend Karin
    Midular\u2019s funeral stating that it would turn it into a political spectacle,
    straining their relationship with the Federation further.\n\nOn the 4th of July,
    YC115 Karin Midular, The Ray of Matar, was removed from the Great Caravanserai
    and taken to her clans ancestral lands on the Mikramurka Steppes. From the city
    of Mithuris a procession led by Vuld Haupt and comprised of her adopted family,
    representatives of all the Sebiestor clans, and the chiefs of other tribes made
    their way several kilometres out of the city to the Place of Silence. Her body
    was then laid out by Haupt in a ritual enclosure, which was then opened to the
    creatures and elements of the Steppes, in a rite reserved for a Sebiestor chief
    and silently observed by all present. \n\n### Karin Midular and Cloning\nKarin
    Midular's private views on cloning have been a topic of some speculation outside
    Minmatar society since her death. Given the availability of various forms of backup
    cloning for non-capsuleers with the ability to afford it in the major empires
    and states of New Eden, many have wondered why Midular apparently lacked such
    a failsafe.\n\nIn Minmatar society, the topic of body- and mind-cloning is considered
    a matter of deep personal ethics within a traditional framework. Discussion of
    these things are not \"taboo\" in any strict sense but it is considered unseemly,
    to the point of infringing social ethics, to talk of the private choices of another
    Matari in public, unless they themselves have openly spoken of it beforehand.
    Careless talk of private matters of this kind in front of non-Matari is considered
    a grave infringement of traditional ethics on a par with wearing an unearned ritual
    tattoo or tribal marking.\n\nKarin Midular, the Ray of Matar, is not on record
    as having spoken of her personal choices in regard to body- and mind-cloning.
    As it was permitted to seek a way to scan her brain during the fight to save her
    life, some have concluded that she had no personal objection to cloning as a means
    to avoid permanent death in the last resort. It is a matter of record that the
    Ray of Matar had no body clone in storage and no brain scan record on file.\n\nStudents
    of the various Matari philosophies and ethical positions on cloning have concluded,
    speculatively, that Karin Midular followed the philosophy of those who believe
    that only one living body and one living spirit, or mind, may exist at any one
    time. Within this tradition there exists a school of thought that believes it
    is acceptable to assist a spirit in crossing from a dying body to a new living
    body.\n\nThe fact that Karin Midular was the last living Ray of Matar, and the
    first known for generations, has led some to believe that she chose to honor the
    tradition of one living body and spirit in part to avoid the paradox of a Midular
    clone body that would not have a Ray marking. While opinions differ on the legitimacy
    of reproducing voluval marks on clones, those of a conservative cast of mind within
    certain Matari traditions would see such a thing as an affront, as Midular the
    unifier would have known.\n\nOpen speculation on this aspect of Karin Midular's
    life has been restricted to Gallente academia, where it has occasionally caused
    controversy among the Matari population of the Federation. The Amarr and Caldari,
    for their part and for their own inscrutable reasons, have inclined not to explore
    the matter in public. Minmatar, needless to say, never speak of this matter in
    public.\n\n### See Also\n\n\u2022 [Chronicle: The Ray of Matar](6ppoF0BO3tLhrkivsxSKsC)\n"

description: Karin Midular was the former Prime Minister of the Minmatar Republic.
  She was known for her peaceful politics and support for domestic cooperation with
  the Amarr Empire, variously interpreted as intelligent caution, cowardly appeasement,
  or outright treason. She was replaced by Sanmatar Malaetu Shakor following the events
  of the Elder War. Her death after injuries sustained in a mass-shooting perpetrated
  by Gerne Broteau resulted in tensions between the previously aligned Minmatar and
  Gallente. Early [...]
