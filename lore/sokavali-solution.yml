- body: '**Sokavali Solution** is a corrosive preparation originally designed for

    skinning human corpses that were to be used for medical purposes.


    Historical Background

    ---------------------


    This greenish acid was first developed to dissolve human skin by

    creating an electron transfer event in the molecules of ectodermal

    tissue. Discovered by [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) scientists before

    the seceded from the [Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK), it was intended

    to be used to remove the skin of medical corpses, leaving the muscle

    structure and all other organs intact and exposed.


    Recently, it has come to more prominent uses in the food industry, where

    it is used to skin livestock whose skin serves no other purpose, such as

    [blackfowl](3UkdFgZAbL4xiqRSCwthdg).


    While the correct term is Sokavali Solution, the use of it in a joke in

    the comedic holoreel "The Holovid Repairman" has led to it being

    colloquially referred to as ''the green acid.''
