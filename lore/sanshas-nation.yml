    dark places of [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk), but few of these are as feared
    as Sansha\u2019s Nation. The existence of the Nation is a testament to the dark
    possibilities of technology and the will of one man, Sansha Kuvakei. The genius
    of Sansha founded and sustained the Nation, but his vision of an intellectual
    elite served by cybernetically dominated slaves led to its downfall. Yet, for
    all that they tried to scrub out the stain of Sansha\u2019s Nation, the empires
    failed and the dream lived on. Slowly but implacably, Sansha\u2019s Nation rose
    again.\n\nFor a hundred years, the Nation was little more than a presence haunting
    the space lanes and remote corners of New Eden, but now they are once more a force
    to be reckoned with. Sansha Kuvakei himself, believed dead for decades, has returned
    and reclaimed his place at the head of the cybernetic legions of the Nation. The
    old empires see the incursions by Sansha\u2019s fleets and True Slave soldiers,
    and they see a threat that could destroy them. So grave is this threat that they
    must call on the double-edged sword of the capsuleer to help throw back the invading
    servants of their old enemy."

- body: "## History\n\n### Prelude\n\nBefore there was a Nation, there was Sansha,
    a strange and wealthy man even before his dreams began to be realized. Sansha
    Kuvakei\u2019s rise began in those wild and heady days when much of New Eden was
    uncolonized and unexplored. The Kuvakei family, an old [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy)
    industrial power, had made their fortune manufacturing armaments during the [war](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV)
    of secession from the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK). As that war
    had settled down to little more than an ongoing border conflict, the empires had
    begun to look ever outward, encouraging more colonization. After succeeding his
    father as head of the Kuvakei family, Sansha found himself wealthy but restless.
    He looked at Caldari society \u2014 indeed, at all the societies of the cluster
    \u2014 and was dissatisfied. He had another vision, an eccentric and megalomaniac
    vision, perhaps, but a vision all his own, and the colonization push would provide
    an ideal vehicle for his ambitions.\n\nDeveloping his own space technology programs
    while maintaining a strong presence in the armaments sector, Kuvakei built up
    his fame and fortune. The Kuvakei corporations struck out into space and developed
    numerous colonies and independent mining operations. Over time a distinct realm
    was carved out by Kuvakei, fully independent of the other empires and highly prosperous.
    He marketed his domain as a new \u201CPromised Land,\u201D with himself as its
    messiah figure. Sansha\u2019s Nation, as this small empire became known, became
    a significant player in the politics of New Eden, and was an ever more popular
    destination for emigration.\n\n### Foundation\n\nBy YC 5, shortly after the establishment
    of [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt), the outlines of Sansha\u2019s Nation were
    established but it had not yet developed the lasting character that would make
    it infamous, and feared, throughout the cluster. With the ranks of his followers
    swelling, Kuvakei was able to establish apparatuses of government, such as a strong
    military, in his domain. Sansha\u2019s Nation had become a very real power, but
    this was not enough for Kuvakei. After all, his disdain for the core empires was
    deeply ideological in nature, and Sansha was not interested in merely replicating
    an old-style polity.\n\nHaving achieved a measure of his dreams, he began to cast
    about for ways to fully realize his utopian vision. At first he simply preached
    utopian ideas, such as his dream of a nation ruled by the intellectual elite for
    the good of all. These notions quickly gained him more followers, particularly
    among those who saw themselves in that elite. The Nation continued to prosper,
    and everyone living within its borders\u2014from close members of Kuvakei\u2019s
    circle to the workers in his arms factories\u2014had nothing but praise for Sansha
    and his achievements.\n\nThe praise only fueled Kuvakei\u2019s delusions of grandeur
    and megalomania, spurring him into exploring ever stranger ideas. Sansha had always
    believed that humanity would be better off under his rule, and now he developed
    the idea of dividing his people into a chosen elite, free of all burdens, and
    a loyal army of workers and soldiers. Kuvakei briefly considered using technology
    to develop robotic servants but he believed that drones, no matter how advanced
    their AI, would lack creativity and adaptability. Sansha wanted to build his new
    world order on the only platform that would answer his needs: the human being.
    But he also knew that this would only be achieved reliably, to his standards,
    with technology.\n\nTo his knowledge, the best joining of human and machine was
    found with the hydrostatic [capsule](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ), as given to the
    Caldari by the [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G) some years earlier. After studying
    the potential of this technology, Kuvakei came up with the idea of fusing capsule
    technology with existing brain implant technology to create willing slaves. The
    implant technologies he intended to experiment with were in the main highly illegal,
    and, of course, in order to perfect the techniques involved, he would need test
    subjects. Here were sown the seeds of Sansha Kuvakei\u2019s downfall.\n\nTo Kuvakei
    the solution to his conundrum was clear enough. One empire, above all others,
    could supply his needs. The [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) were the leaders in
    implant technology and suffered no scruples when it came to trafficking in human
    flesh. Indeed, the Amarr Empire was rather keen to cooperate with Sansha, anticipating
    that they might gain new methods of controlling their vast slave populations from
    the collaboration. Large numbers of [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) slaves
    were therefore shipped to Kuvakei\u2019s Promised Land, and he experimented on
    these unfortunates without thought for their individuality. Sansha\u2019s every
    effort was bent toward turning his subjects into an utterly loyal army who would
    live and die at his command.\n\nKuvakei succeeded, and his biomedical facilities
    were soon pouring out a steady stream of cybernetically enhanced slaves: [True
    Slaves](2OMQ8inZvuePjeJdMpDz3B), as Sansha called them. The True Slaves were used
    for every kind of menial labor, but their adaptability made them suitable for
    many tasks above the merely routine. Sansha also began to use these unquestioning
    slaves as guards and soldiers, replacing the entirety of the Nation\u2019s military
    with True Slave soldiers and pilots.\n\nWith his army of True Slaves providing
    for their every need, the scientists, philosophers, and other intellectuals became
    the Nation\u2019s True Citizens. Initially, most were unaware of the extent of
    Sansha\u2019s crimes, but over time they understood the nature of the new order.
    Most of them accepted it as simply the logical and right outcome of the philosophy
    that had attracted them to Sansha\u2019s Nation in the first place. The True Citizens
    helped spread the \u201Cgood word\u201D of the Nation, bringing more and more
    followers into the realm. Only a few decades after its foundation, Sansha\u2019s
    Nation spanned several regions and was beginning to rival the core empires in
    power. By now, even the Amarr were growing concerned, and closer scrutiny of Sansha\u2019s
    Nation by the empires was inevitable.\n\n### The Downfall\n\nThe few years following
    Kuvakei\u2019s development of the True Slaves were ones of turmoil for Sansha\u2019s
    Nation. Many of those who had migrated there in search of the Promised Land of
    his promotional material returned to the core empires of their origin, as True
    Slaves supplanted them in their workplaces. Others, for all intents and purposes,
    disappeared. Some prominent opponents and investigators of Sansha\u2019s Nation
    either died mysteriously or also disappeared. The curiosity of the empires was
    piqued, and various police and security agencies began to ask questions and send
    their own investigators. Some of these disappeared too. Others died in ways that
    were not at all subtle. Police stations exploded. Ships crashed. Kuvakei was unable
    to stem the tide, and his many agents and advocates had no better luck. It was
    fast becoming obvious that something was very wrong with Sansha\u2019s Nation.\n\nIn
    YC 37, the truth of what was happening in Sansha\u2019s Nation was revealed to
    New Eden at large by the joint efforts of a Minmatar missing-persons investigator
    and a Gallente security agency. Presented with the incontrovertible evidence,
    CONCORD called for Sansha to surrender himself and face charges. Kuvakei refused.
    Sansha had long known that his secret would be uncovered sooner or later, and
    he had equally known that the rest of New Eden would fail to understand his genius
    or the scope of his vision. He had therefore prepared defenses to resist the inevitable.
    However, even Sansha Kuvakei had not anticipated the strength and ferocity of
    the opposition that would be ranged against him.\n\nThe five CONCORD empires\u2014including
    the Jove, normally reluctant to intervene, and his erstwhile allies the Amarr\u2014
    banded together in a coalition against Sansha\u2019s Nation. By that time, those
    remaining in the Nation were either the fanatic elite of the True Citizens or
    they were the insensate True Slaves. That, at least, was the position of the empires.
    The coalition therefore swept into Kuvakei\u2019s domain without mercy or compunction.
    They destroyed every ship or fleet they encountered. They reduced the settlements
    and infrastructure of the Nation to rubble and ash.\n\nThe Sansha loyalists and
    True Slaves put up some considerable resistance. The strongholds of the Nation
    survived for months, but ultimately the fall was total. Sansha himself was apparently
    killed during the final assault that completed the invasion and suppression of
    his Nation. The coalition recovered remains matching Sansha\u2019s genetic pattern.
    Certainly some True Citizens and elements of his fleets managed to evade capture
    or destruction, and hide until the coalition forces withdrew back to the core
    empires. Nevertheless, the once-mighty Nation was reduced to ruined stations and
    settlements, among which scattered survivors and aimless ships eked out an existence.
    \n\n### A Nation Rebuilt\n\nFollowing the forcible dissolution of Sansha\u2019s
    Nation, the empires debated what to do with the systems they had liberated. After
    much contention, the space was divided up among the core empires but little was
    done to actually make use of it. Except around the fringes, close on existing
    empire territories, there were few attracted to the old Nation systems. Eerie
    stories abounded, and occasionally there were reports of weird and fearsome ships
    unique to Sansha\u2019s Nation. No colonization projects got very far, and the
    Stain region, the heart of Sansha\u2019s empire, was left alone with its ghost
    stations and ominous shadows among the asteroids and moons.\n\nThe scattered remnants
    of Sansha\u2019s Nation were by no means idle. Many isolated units of the Nation\u2019s
    space fleets remained, ready to obey the dictates of their protocols and programming,
    which would still bring doom upon the unwary. Others, more purposeful, had survived
    the purge. True Citizens and some True Slaves capable of leadership and planning
    were at large. Over several decades following the fall, what remained of the Nation
    slowly gathered together. The surviving commanders and warlords pulled together
    the aimless True Slaves in the heart of Sansha\u2019s old Promised Land. Certain
    carefully hidden stations had never been discovered by the coalition, and these
    surviving outposts of Sansha\u2019s Nation served as the new foundation for rebuilding.
    The scientists and commanders slowly began the process of rebuilding the Nation
    from what remained. They built new ships and fresh stations, and secretly recruited
    new followers to the cause. Operating through shell corporations, gobetweens,
    and mercenaries, they procured new subjects for the True Slave conversion process.
    Slowly, carefully, avoiding the attention of the empires, and not without some
    infighting, Sansha\u2019s Nation was rebuilt.\n\nBy YC 105, Sansha\u2019s Nation
    had regained sufficient strength to operate in an increasingly wide area beyond
    the Stain region. Initially, Nation raids and expansion took place in neighboring
    regions such as Catch and Esoteria, but soon enough they felt bold enough to raid
    the Amarr Empire, hated for the treachery that the Nation elite believed the Amarr
    had perpetrated against them. The Nation leadership had read the political situation
    accurately enough, for no new coalition was likely to be formed against them.
    The Jove were increasingly reclusive, and the other four empires were ever more
    at odds with one another. Even so, for as long as it could, Sansha\u2019s Nation
    fed the illusion that the raiding was the result of desperate and isolated units
    of the old Sansha navy, driven to seek resources for mere survival.\n\nUltimately,
    increased exploration by the new class of independent capsuleer pilots disrupted
    the Nation\u2019s operations ever more. The Nation decided to emerge from hiding
    and openly claimed the Stain region as its own. The response to the capsuleer
    threat was to try to recruit capsuleers to their banner. In early YC 108, the
    Nation began to make raids against the [Angel Cartel](3p6aB4GMbVdMUEVYOb3kF0),
    igniting a brief territorial war between the pirate factions that featured capsuleers
    fighting on both sides. A figurehead known as \u201CSansha\u2019s Speaker\u201D
    released an ultimatum to the Angel Cartel and their capsuleer supporters. The
    war cooled, and before too long the Nation returned to inscrutable silence. As
    New Eden was shaken by the events of YC 110, Sansha\u2019s Nation relapsed into
    quiescence, apparently content to see to its own purposes as the Empyrean War
    played out.\n\n### Resurgence and Incursions\n\nSansha\u2019s Nation still appeared
    to many to be an erratic power, possibly even a house divided. The empires\u2019
    intelligence networks reported that some surviving elites were following their
    own plans and setting themselves up as warlords. Others claimed that the vast
    bulk of True Slaves were old reserves following orders received during the heyday
    of the Nation. In May YC 112, events forced a reevaluation of these complacent
    assessments. In a series of sudden, massive assaults, multiple empire star systems
    suffered incursions by Sansha\u2019s Nation forces. The initial invasions took
    place in the empire systems of Niarja, Tama, Balle, and Kamela, but most shocking
    was the means of attack. The invading forces poured through unstable wormholes
    seemingly created at will by the Sansha\u2019s Nation attackers. The assaults
    were against temperate, inhabited planets, and approximately two hundred thousand
    people were abducted before the invaders were driven back. The rapid response
    of capsuleers played a key role in fighting these incursions and the many more
    to come.\n\nThe Sansha\u2019s Nation incursions escalated over the following weeks
    and months, almost to the point of becoming regular. In yet another shock, an
    individual calling himself Master Kuvakei emerged and became the main spokesperson
    on behalf of the Nation. Most were skeptical and dismissed this as a propaganda
    ploy by Sansha\u2019s Nation. However, others believed that Sansha himself had
    returned\u2014resurrected by the advanced science that the Nation controlled\u2014to
    lead his followers again. While most declared themselves against the Nation and
    all its works, some expressed support for the ideals of Sansha\u2019s Nation.
    A number of capsuleers even fought on the side of the invaders whenever they appeared.\n\nThe
    Nation attacks continued for several months. Despite capsuleer resistance, many
    systems, particularly those in low-security areas, were devastated and completely
    depopulated by the assaults. Resistance on the planetary surface was usually reported
    to be low or nonexistent. Some means of suppressing the population, speculated
    to be biochemical agents or nanotechnology, was clearly in use. The body of evidence
    pointing to the individual known as Master Kuvakei indeed being Sansha Kuvakei
    himself had mounted. While some maintained their skepticism, the majority began
    to accept that somehow Kuvakei had returned. The means by which Sansha Kuvakei
    might have survived remains a mystery, but his access to the most advanced biotechnology
    and cybernetics before the downfall is not in doubt.\n\nBy the beginning of YC
    113, the constant Sansha\u2019s Nation attacks changed their focus. Rather than
    assaulting planetary populations directly, the incursions began to disrupt capsuleer
    activities across entire constellations. Incursions began to take place in the
    nullsec regions controlled by capsuleers, as well as the low- and highsecurity
    domains of the empires. This change in tactics appeared to be a response to the
    capsuleer resistance, with several propaganda statements by the Nation indicating
    that the capsuleers were now considered a threat that needed to be eliminated.
    For their part, capsuleers, both those loyal to the empires and those giving their
    allegiance to capsuleer alliances, responded by fighting the incursions wherever
    they appeared. The Sansha\u2019s Nation forces, once dismissed as no more than
    the remnants of a madman\u2019s nightmare vision, are again considered among the
    most dangerous of threats by the empires and CONCORD.\n"

- body: "## Culture\n\nThe vast majority of the Sansha\u2019s Nation population is
    composed of True Slaves. Only a very small number of Nation members are free from
    the control of the enslaving implants they bear. These individuals, known as True
    Citizens, are mostly scientists, researchers, philosophers, doctors, artists,
    and other intelligentsia. Recently, certain generals and warlords have emerged
    as True Citizens. This trend may be an effort to strengthen the might of the Nation\u2019s
    navy or it may reflect some attempt to reincorporate splinter groups that arose
    after the downfall. Even so, independent Sansha\u2019s Nation military governors
    are somewhat rare, but they are utterly ruthless and indifferent to appeals for
    mercy. Ethnically, the Nation is rather diverse, closely matching the overall
    demographics of the cluster at large.\n\n![Sanshas hangar](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/10rNrK7mQHxlVQxJdOVOtj/0281a3b646846927f4b945f775b81a43/Sanshas_hangar.png)\n\n###
    True Slaves\n\nTrue Slaves fill a variety of functions, from performing custodial
    and other menial labors to serving as the military forces of Sansha\u2019s Nation.
    Today\u2019s True Slaves come primarily from abducted populations, which are fitted
    with slave implants. These implants are advanced cybernetic control systems that
    completely subvert the will of those implanted to that of Sansha Kuvakei and his
    most loyal commanders.\n\nTrue Slaves have no will of their own and are often,
    incorrectly, described as \u201Cmindless\u201D by outsiders. In fact, in line
    with Sansha Kuvakei\u2019s vision, individual True Slaves are very much capable
    of thought. Moreover, True Slaves display varying degrees of personality and freedom,
    depending on the degree of control their implants exercise over them, their personal
    psychology, and the requirements of their tasks. Scouts, recruiters, and intelligence
    operatives typically present an appearance and personality much like they had
    before being fitted with implants. Such agents, and other True Slaves whose tasks
    require extended solo or small group operations, often retain a high degree of
    individuality.\n\nNecessarily, a spectrum of control and individuality is seen
    throughout Sansha\u2019s Nation. For example, commanders of fleets are allowed
    to retain their creativity and decisionmaking skills, while assault troops typically
    exhibit a singleminded focus on the instructions they receive. It is true, however,
    that most True Slaves exist in close concert with a form of hive mind that mediates
    and reacts to the flow of data between Sansha\u2019s central command and individual
    slaves.\n\nIt is extremely difficult to remove Sansha enslavement implants once
    they have been installed. After a certain time has passed, most True Slaves lose
    the capacity for independent individuality. The individuality still exists, in
    a sense, but is so enmeshed with the Nation gestalt that psychological recovery
    from the enslavement process is irreversible. When a True Slave reaches this point,
    he lives only for Sansha\u2019s Nation, knowing this and accepting it.\n\n###
    True Citizens\n\nThose who join Sansha\u2019s Nation willingly and are allowed
    to retain their individuality and personalities without modification or control
    are known as True Citizens. They are the elite, new and old, of Sansha\u2019s
    Nation, placed in a position of command and ease according to the grand vision
    of Sansha Kuvakei. True Citizens are typically those scientists, researchers,
    philosophers, and other intellectuals who have answered the call of Sansha\u2019s
    utopian vision. They work together to improve the Nation\u2019s science, technology,
    and organization. Additionally, most of Sansha\u2019s top commanders are True
    Citizens. These individuals are given great control over True Slaves, though always
    with protocols ensuring their control can be superseded by Sansha\u2019s will.\n\nWhile
    their status grants them freedom within the Nation, many True Citizens choose
    to be fitted with implants anyway. These implants link them to the same hive mind
    the True Slaves are beholden to but do not enslave them. These implants are highly
    modified and advanced versions of Sansha\u2019s core technology; with all the
    control functions cut out, they have the primary purpose of boosting the individual\u2019s
    faculties while linking the True Citizens in a greater whole. Outside analysts
    of Sansha\u2019s Nation take a more cynical attitude and suspect that many of
    these implants are indeed greatly advanced, vastly more subtle systems of control
    willingly adopted by the deluded fanatics of Sansha\u2019s Nation.\n\nCONCORD
    intelligence has established that, on rare occasions, Sansha targets specific
    members of society for integration into the Nation\u2019s greater hive mind, exerting
    additional control over them through the slave implants. Additionally, if a True
    Citizen has disloyal thoughts or attempts to act against the Nation\u2019s interests,
    even the limited implants she has voluntarily accepted can be used to bring her
    back into line. Often, this kind of action results in psychological damage. Depending
    on the True Citizen\u2019s worth to the Nation, this can end with her converted
    fully to a True Slave. For their part, Sansha\u2019s Nation and its supporters
    dismiss these claims as propaganda aimed at undermining the utopian vision of
    Sansha Kuvakei.\n\n### Government\nSansha's Nation is a totalitarian dictatorship,
    ruled solely by Sansha Kuvakei. He holds complete command over the legions of
    True Slaves, directing them to whatever whims he holds at the moment. The True
    Slaves are instructed through implants connected by a fluid router system, allowing
    Sansha to issue orders to any True Slave at any time, no matter his or their location.\n\nHowever,
    Sansha does not have the faculties to control every individual detail of his Nation,
    no matter how much he might wish he was able to. Instead, he delegates local control
    to a number of highly trusted, loyal True Citizens such as Vizan Ankonin, Chelm
    Soran, Citizen Astur, and Citizen Arson. These commanders are given carte blanche
    to act as they see fit to advance Sansha's vision. However, because they too are
    fitted with Slave Implants, they are prevented from acting against Sansha's will
    in any way.\n\n#### Foreign Relations and Military\n\nSansha's Nation takes a
    hostile stance toward most sovereign powers in New Eden. It currently continues
    to make incursions against the space of all members of the CONCORD Assembly, as
    well as several non-aligned organizations as well. It has come into open conflict
    with the Angel Cartel in the past and remains hostile toward them and the [Serpentis](64u7D7YksvODwmCFL3llMs).\n\nThe
    [Blood Raiders](7obiU8rOyJkPZ3S0Faxc5W) and [Guristas](55L861YhB1ZfaAST6ZbhdO)
    maintain an uneasy truce with Sansha's Nation, born more out of a mutual hatred
    of the Amarr Empire and Caldari State than any similarity in ideals. The three
    groups refrain from attacking each other or preventing the interests of the others
    from\nbeing achieved. They rarely work together and the Nation has been known
    to poach members from its allies.\n\nSansha's Nation is defended by legions of
    True Slave crewed and piloted ships. Its vessels are instantly recognizable for
    their unusual designs, featuring spine-like antennas and dark, domed windows.
    They possess powerful shields, armor, and laser technology, being on the cutting-edge
    of design and in many cases surpassing the technology of the empires.\n\nThe Nation
    has recently discovered a method of creating artificial wormholes at a whim, enabling
    them to quickly strike across the cluster and lock down entire constellations.
    This technology has not been replicated by the empires, giving the Nation logistical
    superiority over its many enemies.\n\nMost recently, Sansha's Nation has been
    targeting capsuleers with their incursions, though it continues to make attacks
    of opportunity against empire targets. Some capsuleers have declared their loyalty
    to the Nation; recently the Nation has been openly welcoming and recruiting them.\n\n####
    Economy\n\nAs the majority of its population are True Slaves who do not require
    money in any form, Sansha's Nation has no internal currency. True Citizens are
    given anything they desire, either produced by the True Slaves or captured during
    raids on its enemies. Resources more generally are allocated throughout Sansha's
    Nation according to local needs.\n\nThe Nation produces the majority of its material
    needs internally through labor of the True Slaves. It has several colonized worlds
    dedicated to food production, while utilizing stations and mining colonies to
    produce raw materials and transform them into new ships and stations. The Nation
    even has several small factories to produce luxury goods for its True Citizens.\n\nWhile
    Sansha's Nation does not actively trade with any party, it does occasionally exchange
    resources to a limited degree with various outlaw organizations and on certain
    black markets of New Eden.\n"

- body: '## Technology


    Sansha''s Nation is technologically advanced, matching and in some cases surpassing
    every empire save perhaps the Jove. Even then, the Nation may have access to Jove
    technology, as they have been captured occupying stations in Jove space. Its areas
    of particular expertise are ship design, gravitational manipulation, and implant
    technology.


    ### Slave Implants


    All slaves in Sansha''s Nation are controlled with Slave Implants. Far more extensive
    and advanced than the implants capsuleers use to augment their mental acuity,
    Slave Implants completely subvert the will of those implanted. They can take a
    variety of forms, ranging from simple neural implants for those considered easy
    to control, all the way to bulky and invasive "slave helmets" that suppress even
    the smallest contrary thoughts.


    Unlike devices such as transcranial microcontrollers, Slave Implants do not eliminate
    the ability of the slaves to function on higher levels. True Slaves are capable
    of utilizing varying degrees of problem solving and creative abilities, often
    surprising those they are opposing. While a True Slave will never be capable of
    breaking a command, they are capable of acting in a variety of ways to follow
    those commands. More trustworthy and loyal slaves are given increasing amounts
    of autonomy, with some barely appearing different from how they did prior to their
    transformation.


    Even True Citizens are fitted with a form of Slave Implant, though these are primarily
    designed to enhance the user''s abilities rather than subvert their will. Some
    of these devices have fallen into the hands of capsuleers, who use them to augment
    their captaining abilities. As yet, these implants do not appear to link the users
    to Sansha''s will, making it seem likely that another vital component is necessary
    to complete the shackles.


    ### Ships


    Sansha''s ships are well known for their alien designs, with smooth, bulbous shapes
    and protruding spines. They possess advanced laser technology, similar in design
    and function to the weapon systems of Marauders, though all Sansha ship classes
    utilize it. It''s most recent ships have displayed highly efficient energy neutralizers,
    powerful shields and armor repair capabilities, effective afterburner and microwarp
    drives, and extensive electronic warfare capabilities.


    The Nation utilizes several basic hull designs, though they have great internal
    variations. The four most well known are known as the Succubus, Phantasm, Nightmare,
    and Revenant. Blueprints for these designs have fallen into capsuleer hands. However,
    at least one other style of frigate has been seen, though its name and

    design has not been disseminated outside the Nation.


    ### Wormholes


    The Nation has also discovered a method of creating artificial wormholes, seemingly
    at will. These wormholes allow only Sansha ships to pass through, though they
    can be disrupted by continued gravimetric jamming. The method the Nation uses
    to create and restrict these wormholes is unknown by the rest of the cluster,
    giving them a huge logistical advantage.


    It is strongly suspected that the wormhole-generation technology employed by Sansha''s
    Nation is based on Jove technology discovered somewhere in the former territory
    of the First or Second Jove Empires.'

- body: "## Structure\n\n### True Power\n\nThe military and command structure of the
    reconstituted Sansha\u2019s Nation was concentrated in the True Power organization
    by the will of one man, a True Citizen named Vizan Ankonin. By YC 102, the majority
    of surviving Sansha\u2019s Nation military units had come under the control of
    the main successor group to the original Nation. The task of persuading other
    splinter groups of their legitimacy was reaching its limits. There again some
    True Slave units were particularly obdurate and refused the commands of any True
    Citizen. There was a need to clear the board of these pieces so that the rebuilt
    Sansha\u2019s Nation could operate unchallenged in its core domains. Vizan Ankonin
    proved to be an able commander, and his creative skill on the battlefield was
    without equal. The True Citizens decided to place Ankonin at the head of their
    military, an organization they named True Power\u2014after a famous speech by
    Sansha Kuvakei in which he had proclaimed his Nation as \u201Cthe true power behind
    the future of New Eden.\u201D Vizan Ankonin, outfitted with command implants that
    gave him control of True Power, duly removed all threats external and internal.\n\nWith
    a single, unified Sansha\u2019s Nation once again established, True Power became
    its most visible presence in space and across New Eden. Defense, raiding operations,
    and much of the intelligence and security apparatus of Sansha\u2019s Nation are
    controlled by True Power. The Stain region heartlands of the Nation hold many
    True Power stations, while Sansha\u2019s Nation battle stations and military complexes
    can be encountered in the dead spaces of New Eden. The vast majority of True Power
    personnel are, of course, True Slave soldiers, crew, and workers. However, there
    is still a place for the elite True Citizens. Notably, even with the apparent
    return of Sansha Kuvakei, the head of True Power remains the capable Vizan Ankonin,
    loyal as ever to the ideals of the Nation.\n\n### True Creations\n\nOnce True
    Power established itself as the sole heir to the Sansha\u2019s Nation legacy,
    it found a need to spin off certain related functions into a separate corporation.
    True Creations was established to run the various assembly plants, shipyards,
    logistical support, and testing facilities scattered across the Stain region.
    Naturally enough, many True Citizen scientists gravitated toward True Creations,
    and the current head of the organization is Koratama Akkaga, a notorious supporter
    of Sansha Kuvakei from the old days. Akkaga is wanted by every security and police
    agency in the core empires, but the Republic Justice Department in particular
    would like to get their hands on the scientist, due to his record of assisting
    Kuvakei in experiments on Minmatar slaves.\n\nOddly enough, given the nature of
    Sansha\u2019s Nation, True Creations has numerous business and political connections
    beyond the confines of the Nation. The Intaki Syndicate\u2019s Intaki Bank even
    lists True Creations on its stock investment boards. As the Intaki Bank facilitates
    anonymous investment quite happily, this makes a certain amount of sense, extraordinary
    as it may be. Certainly, there are known to be a large number of investors in
    True Creations, possibly reflecting a latent support for the ideals of Sansha\u2019s
    Nation across New Eden. Given the recently demonstrated advances Sansha\u2019s
    Nation has made in several areas of science and technology, many have begun to
    look more closely at True Creations and its work."

- body: "## Leadership\n\nWith the apparent return of Sansha Kuvakei, the picture
    of Sansha\u2019s Nation as a totalitarian dictatorship peopled by mindless slaves
    under the complete control of its founding genius has once again come to the fore.
    This is a convenient, readily explained concept for the core empires that remain
    implacably opposed to the Nation. However, this propaganda image does not tell
    the whole story. It is certainly true that Sansha Kuvakei, or whoever controls
    the slave implants carried by most members of Sansha\u2019s Nation, wields enormous
    power over his people. The True Slaves, whatever their level of individuality
    or capacity for thought might be, are in the final analysis under the irresistible
    command of he who controls their implants. That person is currently and credibly
    believed to be Sansha Kuvakei once again.\n\nYet Kuvakei, for all that he has
    undoubtedly enhanced himself, and for all that the Nation hive mind assists immeasurably
    in joining the many skeins of control together in a coherent pattern, cannot exert
    close control over the entirety of his empire. Sansha Kuvakei needs and has help,
    most of it the willing help of his fanatical True Citizen followers, and some
    of it the useful aid of those True Slaves under the loosest degree of control.
    The very fabric of New Eden also makes this distribution of power and agency necessary.
    While Kuvakei undoubtedly dreams of technologies of command and control that break
    the limits of existing faster-than-light technology\u2014and some believe he possesses
    technology that to some extent already breaks those limits\u2014he and his hive
    mind remain limited by the fabric of reality.\n\nThe leadership of Sansha\u2019s
    Nation are a varied and disparate collection of scientists, soldiers, administrators,
    and warlords, but they all have one thing in common: whether True Citizen or True
    Slave, they all willingly pledge total loyalty to Sansha and his grand vision.
    Fanaticism is found in many empires, factions, and corporations across New Eden.
    But seldom has such deep and abiding fanaticism as is commonplace in the leadership
    of the Nation been yoked to the service of one man\u2019s dream."

- body: "## Notable Characters\n\n### Sansha Kuvakei\n\nIn his origins the scion of
    a wealthy Caldari family, Kuvakei considerably enhanced his fortune as an industrialist
    and arms dealer during the Gallente-Caldari War. His great wealth and access to
    expertise in the space technology field allowed him to colonize a great swath
    of space that he subsequently forged into one realm under his utopian rule: Sansha\u2019s
    Nation. Over time his ideals and dreams became ever more perverted into a grotesque
    vision of a select elite, led by him, served by legions of cybernetically enhanced
    and controlled slaves. His achievement was to actually realize this megalomaniac
    scheme. CONCORD and the five empires uncovered the reality of Sansha\u2019s Nation
    and waged a war that seemingly ended with his realm in ruins and his life at an
    end. Yet decades later, Sansha Kuvakei has apparently returned to lead his True
    Slave legions once again.\n\n### Vizan Ankonin\n\nA skilled and ruthless military
    leader, Vizan Ankonin rose to lead True Power during the years when Sansha\u2019s
    Nation was rebuilding itself in the hidden pockets of the Stain region. While
    Sansha was reckoned dead, Ankonin was considered by many to be the effective head
    of Sansha\u2019s Nation. In fact, while powerful indeed, Ankonin always worked
    with the upper circle of True Citizens that had done so much to resurrect the
    Nation. Since the return of Sansha, an event seemingly welcomed, and perhaps worked
    toward, by the elites of the Nation, Ankonin has loyally commanded True Power
    in the name of Sansha Kuvakei.\n\n### Koratama Akkaga\n\nTruly one of the old
    guard, Koratama Akkaga was an early follower of Sansha Kuvakei in the heady days
    of the Nation\u2019s founding. One of the few that managed to evade the purging
    invasion by the core empires, Akkaga was instrumental in assembling as many surviving
    True Citizens as possible during the rebuilding phase of Sansha\u2019s Nation.
    When it became logical that the production and research functions of Sansha\u2019s
    Nation should be spun off into a separate entity from True Power, Koratama Akkaga
    was the logical choice to head the new corporation. Akkaga is especially reviled
    by the Minmatar for his role in assisting Kuvakei with experimentation on Minmatar
    slaves supplied by the Amarr.\n\n### Citizen Astur\n\nCitizen Astur was one of
    the most prominent Sansha\u2019s Nation commanders during the initial period of
    incursions and planetary raiding that took place through YC 112. Astur led numerous
    raids against each of the core empires, usually commanding in the field from a
    capital ship such as a carrier, and was for a time regarded as the architect of
    the Nation\u2019s campaign of incursions. Citizen Astur faded into the background
    somewhat when the figure calling himself \u201CMaster Kuvakei\u201D emerged from
    the shadows of the Stain region. Astur was confirmed in battle to be a capsuleer,
    with extensive additional implants and modifications discovered on her various
    recovered corpses.\n\n### Brokara Ryver\n\nBrokara Ryver is one of the relatively
    few top commanders in the Sansha\u2019s Nation military who is a True Slave. Ryver
    was at one time a slave in the Amarr Empire, but during the early days of Sansha\u2019s
    Nation, she was shipped to Stain and fell into the hands of Kuvakei himself. She
    became one of his most successful early True Slaves, and it is whispered by some
    that Kuvakei was always rather fond of Ryver. Whatever the truth of those salacious
    rumors might be, Ryver herself is as emotionless as the machines that riddle her
    body.\n\n### Chelm Soran\n\nChelm Soran was born with extreme autism. When this
    condition became evident, he was nothing but an embarrassment to his Amarr holder
    parents. Chelm was put away until a chance encounter between Sansha Kuvakei\u2014on
    one of his trips into the empire to arrange transport of slaves to his budding
    Nation\u2014and Holder Soran. Kuvakei, curious as to the effect his techniques
    might have on the severely autistic, offered to take the young man off the hands
    of his parents. The Soran family readily agreed, and Chelm Soran was soon another
    of Kuvakei\u2019s subjects. Chelm\u2019s unique mind, in fact rather quick and
    capable of a great depth of analysis, adapted well to Kuvakei\u2019s experimental
    implants. In the end, Kuvakei, pleased with his new recruit, left the entirety
    of Chelm\u2019s individual personality in place without controlling implants.
    Chelm Soran is today one of the most formidable officers in the ranks of Sansha\u2019s
    Nation, with a bold, relentless drive to succeed in battle."
