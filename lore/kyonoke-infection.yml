    man has come into contact with.


    Effects on hosts

    ----------------

    A biological speck resembling a protein causes the plague. It enters the body
    through the respiration system and then enters the blood stream. From there it
    moves to the brain, where it germinates. In its advanced state, the protein speck
    enters the medulla oblongata, where it infects the nerve cells very rapidly. The
    host quickly loses control over all bodily functions, accompanied by a great amount
    of pain, finally resulting in [heart and lung failure](5WNhh1Tm9Ucm0ni1HgOotc)
    within the space of a few minutes. The specks can survive in an advanced state
    for a few days; they can leave a dead host and enter another living being close
    by, in such cases the new host dies within a few hours once the speck has reached
    the brain.


    Dormancy period and slow infection

    ----------------------------------


    The speck can also be found in a basic state. As such, it can lie dormant for
    years and it can survive in extreme environments and conditions. When it enters
    a living being it usually starts developing to its advanced state, but this is
    not always the case; it can also lie dormant within a person for a long period
    of time. It can also enter the brain and start infecting proteins there, slowly
    but steadily killing the host by eating up its brain over a course of few months.
    This dual nature of the bio-speck makes it even more of an enigma, not to mention
    more dangerous.


    Origin

    ------

    It can be safely deduced that the biological speck was accidentally uncovered
    in the bowels of the asteroid Kyonoke Pit is on, but whether it originated there
    or not is impossible to tell. It is virtually impossible to detect the speck in
    a person, due to the fact it resembles normal proteins to such a high degree.
    This has led to speculations that the speck evolved in humans or was even man-made
    a long time ago, but these speculations have never been substantiated.


    In any case, because of the difficulties in detecting and tracing the bio-speck
    and because it has 100% fatality rate, the bio-speck has fascinated both military
    researchers and terrorist groups, both of which are eager to get their hands on
    the speck.
