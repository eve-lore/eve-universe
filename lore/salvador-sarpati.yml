- body: "The evil genius, as some would say, at the top of the Serpentis organization,
    Virge Salvador Sarpati founded the corporation and built it into the drugs empire
    of today with absolute devotion. Preferring to be known as \u2018V. Salvador Sarpati\u2019,
    the leader of Serpentis is sometimes referred to as \u2018The Snake\u2019, though
    never in his hearing and only by enemies and the most daring of his servants.
    Truth be told, while he keeps up an appearance of disliking the nickname, Sarpati
    takes a rather perverse pleasure in it. A near-obsessional preoccupation with
    long-term schemes, mysterious research projects and his ever-present hatred of
    the Gallente Federation are key to understanding Sarpati. Nevertheless, the health
    and prosperity of the Serpentis Corporation remains his chief concern, all else
    being a means to an end for Salvador Sarpati.\n"
