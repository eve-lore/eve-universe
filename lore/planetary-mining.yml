    important in [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) for any

    manufacturing station that wants to compete on equal footing with

    [stations](Space-stations) orbiting inhabited planets.


    Although such stations do occasionally exist without the support of a

    mineral rich stellar body, they must then rely on minerals being

    transported to them, which is always more cumbersome and expensive. This

    has made uninhabited but mineral-rich planets gold mines - often in the

    literal sense - for anyone aspiring to large-scale manufacturing.
