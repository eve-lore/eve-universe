    Sabotage

    --------


    The popularity of the show at one point led [the Bleeding Hearts of Matar](6dnrAA9AjQYVqCIiXoHfr)
    to attempt to sabotage it by kidnapping first Samne and then Cherall''s daughter,
    in an attempt to force Cherall to renounce his faith live on the air and subsequently
    cancel the show. The attempt failed, to Cherall''s great personal cost.
