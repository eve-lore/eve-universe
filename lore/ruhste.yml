- body: 'The **Ruhste** is a tribal [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) dance. It is

    a violent art, characterized by constant spins in the air, and has been

    described as art imitating violence imitating art. It was previously

    banned by the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) during the occupation, as the

    Amarr feared it could be used to secretly teach martial arts. The

    practice was resumed following the [Minmatar Rebellion](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N),
    but it received no official

    funding or approval from the government.
