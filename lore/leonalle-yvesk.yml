- body: '**Leonalle Yvesk** is the Planetary Administrator of [Chesiette Prime](5jcyTOxG707UXLRMAB9eC3).
    It took him 50 years to climb to his position, though because Federation politics
    are so efficient, he is viewed more as a middle manager than a frontier diplomat.
    His assistant, [Colasa](4ZuFb1qjanyJMZz04wXBsy), is a younger [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK)
    woman.


    ### Capsuleer dealings


    Leonalle normally finds Colasa''s meek attitude pleasing, but it tends to annoy
    him on the days he is to meet with [capsuleers](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ).


    On one occasion that capsuleer turned out to be [Omvistus](14Seg6wEOEpNHopnuUbUtZ),
    whose corporation had plans to develop the planet for their own use. Though Leonalle
    noted the planet could not

    adequately perform all the tasks Omvistus demanded, Omvistus deployed

    his own industrial sectors and spaceports, giving Leonalle little time

    to evacuate populated areas the new facilities will arrive at. When he

    attempted to refuse the capsuleer, Omvistus targeted his office from

    space and threatened to destroy a two kilometer radius around it.

    Leonalle backed down following the threat and listened passively to

    Omvistus'' demands.
