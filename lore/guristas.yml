    and technically-minded [Rabbit](3Mb6UfjhKf0MdSbbR4a2EU), the **Guristas** pirates
    are a fearless, professional and highly-organized outfit operating out of their
    home region of Venal. Unlike other rogue factions, their activities are based
    not around any twisted ideology or creed, but rather a good old-fashioned lust
    for wealth and power. \n\nThe Guristas focus primarily on interstellar piracy
    in the outer regions and low-security space. The Guristas maintain hundreds of
    deadspace listening posts and staging points on the Caldari border, and are known
    for being unafraid to stage strikes deep within the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy).\n\nTypically
    their business revolves around black-market trading, including human trafficking,
    illegal weapons manufacture, and smuggling of illicit goods. In addition to this,
    the Guristas control a large share of the gray market within the Caldari State,
    smuggling unregulated products into megacorporation enclaves within state borders.\n\nPossibly
    the most lucrative of their operations, however, are their counterfeiting circles.
    Unafraid to knock off anything from designer goods to hard currency, the Guristas
    will bluff any market that can cut them a clean and sizable profit. Just one example
    is their illegal currency exchange of Caldari corporate scrip, the largest network
    of its type in New Eden."

- body: "## History\n\nIn less than a decade, thanks largely to a series of risky
    high-profile raids, the Guristas established themselves as a major player in the
    underworld of New Eden. Founded in YC 94 by two deserters from the Caldari Navy,
    Jirai \u201CFatal\u201D Laitanen and Korako \u201CThe Rabbit\u201D Kosakami, the
    Guristas organization quickly gained a reputation as a haven for those exiled
    from the Caldari State. It was not until YC 101, however, that the pair cemented
    the legendary status they hold today by kidnapping and ransoming the then ambassador
    of the Gallente Federation to the Caldari State, a man by the name of Luecin Rileau.
    From that point onwards, the Guristas Pirates were a prominent and increasingly
    powerful thorn in the side of the Caldari State.\n\n### Founding\n\nIn YC 86,
    Jirai \"Fatal\" Laitanen found himself passed over for promotion, a blow felt
    keenly to his ego. His friend Korako \"the Rabbit\" Kosakami was held responsible
    for a fatal crash landing. Deciding they had enough, the pair from the 37th (Octopus)
    squadron stole a Condor-class frigate and disappeared into the lawless void between
    Caldari and Gallente space.\n\nIn YC 94, they re-emerged with the founding of
    the Guristas, which means 'naughty people' in the Caldari tongue. Their criminal
    organization quickly rose to fame and power within the New Eden underworld. Profiling
    themselves as a haven for Caldari exiles, they managed to grow their ranks at
    a steady pace.\n\n### Kidnapping of Ambassador Rileau\n\nYC 101 was the year of
    their biggest heist to date. The pair hatched a plan to kidnap Federation Ambassador
    Lucin Rileau from the famous Grand Tiegjon Casino in the Caldari system of Vellaine
    by taking advantage of his biggest vice: gambling. \n\nThe two young pirates docked
    at the casino station in disguise, before Fatal proceeded to deliberately lose
    a high-stakes game to the ambassador, wagering his ship, a *Caracal*-class cruiser,
    as payment. Meanwhile, the Rabbit had rigged the vessel\u2019s forward boarding
    ramp with canisters of nitrous oxide. When the ambassador and his bodyguards entered
    the ship to inspect his winnings, the Rabbit sealed the area and filled it with
    the powerful sleeping gas, incapacitating both Rileau and his entire protection
    detail.\n\nIt was only when another vessel elected to use the same docking collar
    an hour later and happened upon a boarding ramp filled with unconscious bodyguards
    that the alarm was raised. By this time the Guristas duo were long gone with their
    captive, leading to a manhunt that created a media sensation in the Gallente Federation.\n\nWith
    the operation a resounding success, the federation\u2019s inability to apprehend
    Fatal and the Rabbit led to an enormous ransom being paid to the Guristas in uncut
    diamonds by the ambassador\u2019s father, Daroun \u201CDiamond King\u201D Rileau,
    for his safe return.\n\nEver since, the Guristas have maintained a reputation
    as one of the most ubiquitous pirate organizations in the cluster, their numbers
    swelling rapidly in size. Soon after the successful ransom on Ambassador Rileau,
    the organization relocated from the Caldari State borderlands to the region of
    Venal, where they stage operations from their heavily fortified strongholds.\n\n###
    Ishukone and the Raven\n\nThe Guristas are not against working with the Caldari
    when it suits their agenda, and no event is more notable than the story of how
    they obtained access to the Raven battleship blueprint and the start of the career
    of Otro Gariushi as Ishukone's CEO. Most of this however is still unknown to the
    general public.\n\nOtro Garuishi's father, Villamo, started dealing drugs for
    the Guristas after he lost his job as Ishukone for stating the truth rather than
    what his superiors wished to hear. The loss of his wife in an industrial accident,
    and the estrangement of his daughter meant that his hopes were built upon providing
    his son Otro with a better life. This hope however was cut short when an Ishukone
    executive shot Vilamo after purchasing drugs from him. The Guristas, disgusted
    by the actions and knowing of\nVilamo's plight, offered Otro a chance to enter
    their ranks.\n\nWhile Otro was further raised under Guristas influence, he drifted
    apart from them in pursuit of his quest for vengeance. This caused a notable rift
    between himself and the officer named Bane, who was working with the corrupt Ishukone
    CEO Les Akkilen. Akkilen provided the Guristas with information on their competitors
    in exchange for protection, a move that was beneficial to covering up his failures
    as a CEO.\n\nOtro, who managed to recover his long lost sister Mila, struck up
    a partnership with her and his associate Gavriel, benefitting from Mila's years
    of corporate espionage under the guise of an escort service. Together they targeted
    Ralirashi Okimo, the Chief Financial Officer for Ishukone. From him they extracted
    information on the Raven, a secret project that Akkilen was unaware of which Rali
    was funding to ensure his position within the company. One of Mila's madames persuaded
    Rali to work with them through means of blackmail and by playing on his weaknesses.\n\nDuring
    a board meeting, Rali unveiled the Raven. It was sent into unregulated space and
    attacked a Guristas fleet. Otro used this to convince Fatal that he must tell
    Bane to halt the ongoing attack on Gavriel and Mila. Base refused and Fatal agreed
    to give up Bane in exchange to access to the Raven blueprints. Proof of Akikilen's\ncorruption
    was presented to the board and established Otro Gariushi as the new CEO of Ishukone,
    joined by his sister Mila as CFO (known as Kinachi Hepimeki to the public).\n\n###
    Crielere\n\nA dark page from the Guristas' history comes from the events that
    took place at the Crielere research project. Fatal managed to have a Caldari research
    agent named Ariko spy on behalf of her parent corporation Wiyrkomi. She was instructed
    to poison the Senate-enlised Medila, the personal aide to the two head scientists.
    Meanwhile Otro Gariushi (then already CEO of Ishukone) had blueprints and equipment
    stolen to assist in further sabotage. When the Senate caught wind of this debacle
    they pulled their funding, as did the involved mega-corporations. The project
    remained running with only a skeleton crew in place, unprotected now that the
    Empires had pulled back their police forces.\n\nThis opened the way for Fatal
    and the Guristas to arrive. Capsuleers, however, caught wind of the situation
    and attempted to drive back the pirate forces. The Guristas targeted the station
    and caused massive damage before being forced to temporarily retreat. Later on
    they returned and, thanks to past access granted by Ariko, the Rabbit was able
    to enter the station and capture one of the head scientists, Tarimo Umailen. Using
    his life as a ransom, the other head scientist Henric Touvolle was also kidnapped
    and led off station. It was during this escape that Fatal got podded, resulting
    in his ousting from the Guristas and subsequent exile as the use of a low quality
    clone left him with severe memory loss and reduced motor functions.\n\nThe Guristas
    decided to try and wash their hands clean of the failure and sell the scientists
    to Articio Kor-Azor, their highest bidder. While the Federation under president
    Foiritan tried to get the scientists back, they were unfortunately lost due to
    identity theft during supposed return on a slave transport. They eventually expired
    while working within a slave colony.\n\n### Recent Events\n\nDespite the distance
    of their headquarters from the Caldari border, the Guristas have deeply rooted
    history with several Caldari megacorporations and thus keep a close eye on affairs
    within the state through their network of shell corporations and aliases. They
    are rumored to have their fingers deep in the dealings of many of the Caldari\u2019s
    biggest corporate entities, the most notorious of their ties being their oft-rumored
    but never proven connection with the Ishukone Corporation, which was led for a
    decade by former Gurista Otro Gariushi (whose father, Vilamo, had been a long-serving
    member of the Guristas).\n\nDuring the increased Caldari Navy mobilization of
    YC 115, the Guristas joined Mordu's Legion in rescuing victims of the conflict
    and offering them adequate aid. It is thought that their humanitarian efforts
    were in fact simply an attempt to profit from the situation and to draw those
    whom now may scorn the State over to their side by profiling themselves as rescuers.\n\nWith
    the news spreading on 'ghost sites' and CONCORD's subsequent off-limit declaration,
    the Guristas as well as other pirate factions have begun to issue buy orders to
    coerce capuleers into selling the recovered covert research tools to them. This
    seems to hint at a pirate research race, and already there is much discussion
    going about what breakthroughs this might eventually lead to. A recent Guristas
    raid\nthat was halted by capsuleer forces raised some hope of seeing some of these
    new advances, but the Federal Intelligence Office was adamant that there was no
    evidence of prototype or unconventional vessels.\n\nIn recent times, the Guristas
    have stepped up their research efforts, with reports of them having overtaken
    research sites previously belonging to other pirate factions, and adding a glut
    of black-market trading to what appears to be a successful line of research into
    high-speed technologies. Mordu's Legion have reportedly become extremely unhappy
    with this turn of events and have responded with extreme force to any sites they
    uncover, having even gone so far as to enlist the\ncapsuleers in the initial efforts
    of finding these sites. Whatever it is exactly that the Guristas are developing
    in these sites remains unknown."

- body: "## Culture\n\n![Guristas members](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/7DhrCs54noHIuONCKdAJct/265dc07ce53f286b8917bcbc8baee5bd/Guristas.png)\n\nWith
    the vast majority of their recruits initially sourced from the Caldari State,
    the Guristas have found it to their benefit to maintain many aspects of state
    culture. A sense of purpose and duty is instilled in the mind of every Gurista,
    with those born into the fold commanding greater respect from their peers than
    those who come from outside. This has become more evident as the organization
    has come of age and a new generation of leaders has begun to rise.\n\nAs the Guristas
    rose to prominence in the wake of the ambassadorial kidnapping, recruits began
    to flood in from across the cluster, and the result is that today some of the
    organization\u2019s most senior command staff are composed of Brutor, Intaki,
    and ethnic Gallente. Though this creates something of a cultural melting pot inwardly,
    the Guristas nonetheless maintain a highly uniform, regimented, and professional
    forward-facing image to the outside world, relying on their solid reputation to
    forge new allegiances and broker high-profit, illicit deals with their allies.
    Maintaining a shaky truce with Sansha\u2019s Nation and a standing of careful
    mutual respect with the Blood Raider Covenant, the Guristas suffer no shortage
    of trade routes and expansion opportunities.\n\nOver the years, they have continued
    to absorb many elements of Caldari culture, including the state\u2019s deep and
    abiding love for gambling. Thousands of illegal bookmakers are funded by the Guristas,
    managing bets on popular Caldari sports such as Splinterz and Mind Clash. From
    bookmakers to match-rigging and illegal tournaments held in hidden establishments
    within deadspace pockets, if you have money to hazard the Guristas will have something
    that strikes the gambler's fancy.\n\nMilitary fashion and Caldari martial traditions
    are also found within abundance everywhere within the Guristas, even after outsiders
    started to enter their ranks. They consider themselves a professional organization
    and will do the utmost to keep up this image. While they are certainly known for
    their outrageous acts at times, they are nevertheless meticulously calculated
    when it comes to the impact upon their reputation.\n\nCoupled with this, in the
    time-honored tradition of pirates across the cluster, and as a stab in the eye
    to the administration that forced them from their home, Kosakami shamelessly reworked
    the designs for the Merlin-class frigate and the Moa-class cruiser, creating the
    Worm and the Gila respectively, two ships which serve as staples of the Guristas
    fleet.\n\nRumors also surround the origins of the recently introduced Scorpion-class
    battleship, which entered service soon after the turn of the first century YC.
    Many Guristas still claim the Scorpion\u2019s design was lifted from the Gurista
    Rattlesnake class, which shares the same basic subframes and systems. Of course,
    Caldari Navy and Ishukone researchers strongly deny these rumors, claiming that
    the Scorpion was designed by the state, and Kosakami simply, once again, stole
    the design and added his own eccentric flavor."

  layout: default
- body: "## Structure and Leadership\n\nFrom their humble roots as a ragtag group
    of marauders, the Guristas have grown into an enormous organization with a heavily
    militaristic command structure that rivals some of the Caldari State\u2019s largest
    corporate police forces. At the top of the hierarchy is Korako Kosakami, who assumes
    full command of all Guristas operations. Beneath him lies a network of fourteen
    officers, including some of the Guristas Pirates\u2019 most notorious faces, each
    of whom takes responsibility for military oversight of his own constellation in
    the region of Venal.\n\nEach of these officers assumes command over a cell of
    lieutenants, who each take responsibility for a part of his cell\u2019s operations,
    such as funding, defense, scouting, manufacturing, and security. Authority within
    each cell flows downwards in a hierarchy rather similar to that of a classic military
    structure. Beneath the lieutenants lies the meat of the organization, the frontline
    command structure seen in daily combat by those who oppose the Guristas.\n\nMore
    often than not, healthy rivalry will be seen between various cells within the
    Guristas, with individual officers competing against each other to cut the largest
    profits, stage the most daring raids, or otherwise outperform each other in the
    field. Typically this level of internal competition is highly encouraged by the
    Guristas leadership, and it often ends up being the root cause of many of their
    more outlandish and daring ventures."

- body: '## Operations


    ### Territory


    The Guristas have hundreds of staging posts set up alongside the Caldari

    border, from which they launch their raids into Caldari territory. This

    allows them to operate well away from their home region of

    [Venal](venal-region) and maintain a healthy presence in the lower

    security systems, occasionally being so bold as to establish themselves

    in high security. Their forces can also be spotted roaming through [Deklein](deklein-region),
    [Tribute](tribute-region), [Tenal](tenal-region), [Branch](branch-region) and
    [Vale of the Silent](vale-of-the-silent-region).


    Subterfuge is not an activity they shy away from. It is thought that

    within the heart of the empires, many shadow corporations and other such

    shady organizations operate with direct and indirect ties to the

    Guristas. How high up the ranks their control reaches, however, is only

    for them to know.


    The Guristas often overtake existing facilities that either have gone

    into ruin and decay or have insufficient protection. Examples of these

    are the gas cloud harvesting operation in 09-4XW, or the by Lai Dai

    corporation abandoned R55 Colonial Ruins in the Isie system, which

    surrounding toxic gas cloud provides it with a defensive barrier. In

    recent times, the Guristas have taken to overtaking secretive research

    facilities of other pirate empires, where they conduct a mix of black

    market trading and skunkworks research into cryptic high-speed

    technologies.


    ### Business


    The Guristas control a notable share of the "grey market" smuggling of

    competing products into megacorporate enclaves in the Caldari State.

    They also run one of the largest illegal currency exchanges of Caldari

    corporate scrip. In addition to this they also engage in other

    counterfeiting practices, knocking off anything that rakes in ISK.

    Black-market trading, illegal weapons, smuggling and human trafficking

    are not something they shy away from when it comes to funding their

    activities and turning a steady profit.


    Lastly, the Guristas are well-known for their work as mercenaries, their

    fearsome reputation often being enough to win a contract before it is

    even executed. Their ruthless methods and proven track-record make them

    a formidable player in that field, one that strikes fear into the hearts

    of those who happen to find themselves on the wrong side.


    ### Ships


    All Guristas vessels appear based on those of the Caldari Navy, although

    the Guristas themselves claim that it was in fact the Caldari Navy who

    stole the design for their Scorpion from the Guristas Rattlesnake.

    Suffice to say the Guristas equivalents of each vessel are offensively

    superior vessels whom fit perfectly within their aggressive tactics, yet

    are able to withstand quite a bit of punishment.


    First came the [Gila](gila), based on the Moa hull. Kosami

    sacrificed speed and cargo capacity to bulk up the ship''s structure. The

    gunnery platform was done away with in favour of missiles supported by

    superior drone capacities. Sadly this expansion led to a slightly less

    powerful capacitor, but thanks to using missiles this is not noticeable

    during operation. Should pilots mind, the extra midslot could certainly

    be employed to rectify this fact.


    The [Worm](worm) was the first frigate that was converted,

    again changing from a turret to a missile platform with drone capacity,

    something which the base Merlin entirely lacks in. Again unneeded space

    was done away with to beef up its survivability rate. Choosing an

    equally strong but slower-charging capacitor, targeting range was

    shortened to adequately power all electronics systems within the hull.


    Then, the [Rattlesnake](rattlesnake) is again a missile and

    drones platform, whereas the Caldari Scorpion offers a mixed weapon

    platform that is often supported by ECM modules. The sturdier

    Rattlesnake also has a different slot layout, having an extra slot in

    the high and low where the Scorpion had an extra midslot squeezed in.

    The Rattlesnake''s targeting systems too are shorter than those of the

    Scorpion.


    Finally the [Taipan](taipan) is a relatively new vessel and

    was based on the iconic Ibis which many new Caldari pilots take their

    first flight in. While the ''rookie ship'' is often scoffed at, the

    Guristas once more prove themselves capable of building fearsome ships.

    Without sacrifice they were able to strengthen its structure and even

    find space for an additional midslot. While the two turrent hardslots

    were given up, the Taipan can field drones and thus match the Guristas

    fleet doctrine.'

- body: '## Relations


    The Guristas are heavily disliked by the Caldari, their military allies the Amarr,
    and the Ammatar and Khanid Kingdom by extension. The Gallente and Minmatar, however,
    maintain a neutral stance towards the Guristas. This is likely due to the fact
    their territory does not form the target of Guristas raids, and there is speculation
    that the enemy of their enemy status may be a redeeming factor as well, though
    neither will ever publicly admit to this. The Thukker Tribe forms the exception
    to this

    rule, thought to be because before their joining of the Republic they and the
    Guristas were competitors in the grey market.


    The Guristas themselves hold no love for Amarr, and a slight distrust for the
    Ammatar, a stance taken on grounds of slavery. The other empires are regarded
    with neutrality, and (illegal) dealings with them are not out of the question.
    It is only under extreme circumstances, like the aftermath of the Crielere raids,
    that the Guristas will close a deal with the Amarr. The fate of the ransomed scientists
    acted as further salt into the wound and is often cited as an example as to why
    the Amarr

    are not to be trusted or shown any mercy.


    When it comes to the other pirate factions the Guristas are liked by the Nation
    and even more so by the Blood Raider covenant. This is reflected mutually, although
    the Guristas regard the Sansha higher than the Covenant. Why this is has never
    been met with a public answer, and despite the mutual standings the Guristas are
    not known to have ever directly co-operated in any official manner with either
    faction. Unlike

    the Angel Cartel and Serpentis business relationship it seems to be more a matter
    of shared dislikes and forming an opposing ''pirate bloc''.


    CONCORD rates the Guristas as second most hated after Sansha''s Nation, on part
    with the Blood Raiders. When asked about this an official stated that their ratings
    are largely influenced by the aggressiveness and overall threat to peace that
    any given pirate faction forms. Unsurprisingly, the Guristas are no fans of CONCORD
    either and treat them with similar disdain.


    Worthy of note is that there exists a strong and mutual rivalry between Mordu''s
    Legion and the Guristas. The stance of the Legion makes sense, as it is an extension
    of that of the Caldari. Furthermore they idealize the honor code, integrity and
    military ideals whereas the Guristas are in the mercenary business for good old
    greed and lust for power. The feelings however became mutual after a series of
    incidents within the mercenary business. Each side will claim the other started
    it, but what is sure is that an escalation of theft and sabotage of contracts
    caused

    both parties to hate each other''s guts. Even to this day both sides will practice
    caution to keep their business a secret from each other, and when they do find
    themselves on opposing sides of a conflict it is pretty much a guarantee that
    things will get personal.


    The Servant Sisters of EVE, Interbus and the Society all carry a minor dislike
    for the Guristas. The Guristas are neutral towards the former, but mimic the standings
    of the latter. This seems to be grounded in a clash of ideologies, but unfavorable
    affairs may also be to blame. No real public information has ever been given nor
    officially requested.


    Finally, the Jove and ORE are reciprocally neutral with the Guristas, and a fair
    guess here is that none have really interacted or had reasons for interaction.'

- body: "## Notable Characters\n\n### Jirai \u201CFatal\u201D Laitanen\n\nJirai Laitanen
    was born on July 3, YC 65, to a father whose entire career was based around Caldari
    Navy service. Similarly, his mother\u2019s career was spent in loyalty to only
    a single megacorporation: she was a corporate accounts manager for the Kaalakiota
    Corporation.\n\nAfter being raised on New Caldari Prime and educated at one of
    the most renowned boarding schools in the state, Laitanen was drafted into the
    Caldari Navy immediately upon reaching legal age. He was expected to follow in
    his father\u2019s footsteps, commanding a vessel of his own.\n\nProving to be
    a shrewd, silver-tongued, and gifted captain, Laitanen rapidly made a name for
    himself among the pilots of the Caldari Navy\u2019s Thirty-Seventh (Octopus) Squadron,
    establishing himself as an outstanding pilot and tactician. At the same time,
    his charismatic smile could never quite hide the vanity and power hunger that
    lurked beneath, traits that eventually led to his desertion from the Caldari Navy
    at age twenty-nine after he was passed over for promotion. After eleven years
    of military service, he had befriended and become increasingly close to fellow
    deserter Korako Kosakami, and together they founded the Guristas Pirates in YC
    94.\n\nAfter a meteoric rise to infamy as the cofounder and charismatic leader
    of the Guristas, his career was brought to an abrupt end during an assault on
    the Crielere Research Laboratories in early YC 106, whereupon his ship was destroyed
    and he himself pod killed by capsuleer forces intent on defending the facility.\n\nLaitanen\u2019s
    current status is a topic rarely discussed by the Guristas at any level, and due
    to his absence from public life since the Crielere raid, there has been widespread
    speculation surrounding his condition. Rumors range from his immediate death due
    to unsuccessful neural transfer to him living in seclusion as a heavily scarred
    shadow of his former self. Throughout the years, it has even been suggested that
    Fatal has been lying mind locked all this time in a clone reanimation unit on
    6NJ8-V IV\u2014the same planet that he and his partner Korako Kosakami terraformed
    together at the outset of their venture.\n\n### Korako \u201CThe Rabbit\u201D
    Kosakami\n\nBorn into a family in service of Lai Dai on August 26, YC 71, Korako
    Kosakami, also known by his nickname, \u201CThe Rabbit,\u201D began life on the
    planet of Nonni I with a corporate education funded by his parent corporation.
    Most of his early engineering education came from his mother, who served as a
    flight technician for Lai Dai\u2019s advanced research and development program.
    Once of working age, Korako was expected to assume the same role as his father,
    who was an MTAC maintenance engineer from Ikami VII.\n\nDespite crippling introversion
    and a pronounced stutter that plagued Kosakami throughout his adolescent years,
    it rapidly became apparent to Kosakami\u2019s teachers that he was extremely gifted,
    possessing an intellect that far surpassed that of many of his tutors, as well
    as his peers. Upon his graduation, he was immediately moved from his commercial
    contract with Lai Dai to a position with military research and development, and
    assigned to the Caldari Navy\u2019s Thirty-Seventh (Octopus) Squadron, where he
    immediately befriended and became increasingly close to fellow pilot Jirai Laitanen.
    In YC 94, when within the space of a week Laitanen was passed over for promotion
    and Kosakami was blamed for the lethal crash landing of a prototype stealth drop
    ship that killed forty-seven military personnel, the pair deserted together and
    made off into the Caldari Border Zone, founding the Guristas Pirates soon after.\n\nEver
    shying away from the limelight, Kosakami encouraged Laitanen to become both the
    visible leader and the mouthpiece of the Guristas, while he himself worked behind
    the scenes to further their goals and create a fleet worthy of the organization\u2019s
    colors. He was hit hard in early YC 106 when Fatal was taken from his side by
    the action of independent capsuleers during the second Guristas assault on the
    Crielere Project. Choosing to retreat from public life, Kosakami has led the Guristas
    from the organization\u2019s headquarters in Venal, and his rule has seen them
    push from strength to strength in the last decade, remaining a persistent thorn
    in the side of the Caldari State and any other organization that crosses their
    path.\n\nToday, Kosakami resides on 6NJ8-V IV, the same world that he and Laitanen
    terraformed together at enormous personal expense to create a retreat from the
    intensity of leadership. While he still maintains constant contact with even the
    lowest echelons of the Guristas, believing it to be good working practice to have
    a finger on the pulse of his organization, his many years in self-imposed confinement
    have left him bitter and vengeful against all but the few capsuleers who fly under
    his colors.\n\n### Estamel Tharchon\n\nDriven by a hate-filled agenda to bring
    down the Caldari State, Tharchon pulls no punches and wastes no opportunity to
    bring mayhem to the state in any way she possibly can. Bastard child of a prominent
    Caldari businessman and his Intaki mistress, who both ostracized her when she
    started to display the typical rebellious symptoms of a child raised in a broken
    home in her late teens, Estamel joined the Guristas at the age of thirty-one in
    YC 98, after spending a number of years as an independent mercenary, following
    a failed career with Wiyrkomi Peace Corps.\n\nInitially making a name for herself
    as a gun for hire, she was drawn into the ranks of the Guristas Pirates after
    a run of highly successful contracts against military targets in the state, and
    has become a fundamental figurehead among the fleet commanders charged with defending
    Venal.\n\n### Kaikka Peunato\n\nA naturally gifted and highly competent pilot
    and tactician, Kaikka was forced out of the Caldari Navy at the tender age of
    twenty, after just two years of service, when he revealed that he was homosexual.
    Disowned by his hard-line Patriot father, who was also serving with the Caldari
    Navy as a general with the Kimotoro Defense Fleet, Peunato gravitated toward the
    Guristas after hearing stories of their raids across state borders and the close
    companionship of their infamous leaders, Fatal and the Rabbit. Since joining the
    Guristas several months after his defection from the Caldari Navy in YC 101, Kaikka
    has become instrumental in expanding their influence with his ingenious battlefield
    tactics, and can often be found on the frontlines of conflict.\n\n### Thon Eney\n\nBorn
    into a life of crime on TXW-EI IV, Thon Eney operated for many years as an enforcer
    and racketeer for the Intaki Syndicate, providing loans and collecting on bad
    debts owed to the syndicate.\n\nDuring her years before joining the Guristas,
    she also specialized in offering herself for hire as an armed escort before finally
    giving in to sheer greed and joining what was then a young but highly profitable
    venture, into which she was welcomed by Fatal and the Rabbit.\n\nEney joined the
    Guristas when she was thirty-seven, at roughly the same time as Estamel Tharchon,
    in YC 98, and ascended with great speed through their ranks. This comes as no
    surprise to her peers, given her powerful and charismatic presence, outstanding
    leadership ability, and fiercely ambitious temperament.\n\n### Vepas Minimala\n\nMinimala
    is one of the oldest serving officers with the Guristas Pirates, and his skills
    in combat are legendary among the ranks of both the Guristas and their adversaries.
    Born in YC 44, and having served for almost three decades with the Caldari Navy,
    Vepas defected after he was denied the rank of admiral during a review of his
    combat performance. Joining the Guristas in YC 94 at age fifty-one, shortly after
    their formation, he worked alongside Jirai Laitanen to plan some of their most
    dangerous missions behind state lines over their first ten years of operation
    and was instrumental in the development of many of the tactics still used by the
    Guristas to this day.\n\nNow in his seventies, he is still often seen in combat
    due to his lust for glory, and he is regarded to this day to be one of the most
    formidable pilots ever to fly with the Guristas.\n\n### Lucash Helmatt\n\nA former
    combat pilot for the Dominations, Lucash Helmatt came to the Guristas in early
    YC 107 after a long and violent career as a combat scout for the Angel Cartel.\n\nBorn
    on Doril II in YC 74, Helmatt proved himself among the raiding squads of the Archangels
    from a young age before being promoted into the Dominations after half a decade
    of successful raids into the republic for the cartel. Several months after joining
    the Guristas, he gained notoriety when he destroyed a Marshal-class CONCORD battleship
    in November YC 107.\n\nAfter celebrating his fortieth birthday last year, Helmatt
    shows no signs of calming his outrageous antics, which almost always put him at
    odds with Vepas Minimala in a competition to be in the limelight. The main rival
    for Minimala in the competition for title of the most skilled pilot in the Guristas
    Pirates, he can often be found prowling the borders of Venal looking for a target
    on which to test his mettle.\n\n### Achile Abraxas\n\nBranded as a traitor with
    a kill-on-sight order, Achile \u201CIronwall\u201D Abraxas has been considered
    an enemy of the Caldari State since he sold out his squadron to the Guristas and
    orchestrated an ambush in which they were all killed in September YC 108.\n\nRaised
    on Caldari Prime before being shipped off to the State War Academy in Kisogo,
    Abraxas excelled as a frigate and interceptor combat pilot, as well as a covert-ops
    scout, until his defection from the Caldari Navy in YC 108. While the reasoning
    for his sudden switch of loyalty has never been revealed, many speculate that
    his abrasive personality and natural dislike for authority, along with a sizable
    bribe from the Guristas, led him to defect and orchestrate the deaths of his wingmen.\n\nA
    highly competent scout upon joining the Guristas, Abraxas has since powered through
    their ranks, proving himself to be a knowledgeable, fast-acting, and dependable
    fleet commander.\n\n### Ohminen Sin\n\nArriving in Venal in a battered Heron-class
    frigate as a disillusioned young defector from the Peace and Order Unit, Sin was
    taken under the wing of Vepas Minimala on joining the Guristas at the age of twenty-one
    in YC 100.\n\nWith her basic flight training from Sukuuvestaa\u2019s security
    arm and training from one of the most combat-competent Guristas in service, Ohminen
    immediately began to shine as a solid tactician and aggressive combatant from
    her first days leading security patrols on the border with Deklein.\n\nNow charged
    with the responsibility of providing a point of contact with the Guristas for
    independent capsuleer pilots, she has been seen in recent times on the frontlines
    as commander of the Guristas Pirates\u2019 Black Rise Squadron.\n"

    #### YC 107


    Juul Anttus, a CONCORD officer who was supplying the Guristas with insider information,
    was found out by Hyota Vasy, a sub-nanite communication engineer. Despite being
    placed in the witness protection scheme, the Guristas managed to track him down
    and nearly succeeded in taking his life. However, due to the interference of local
    pilots, the Guristas suffered heavy losses, including a pair of then-brand-new
    Rattlesnake battleships. When Hyota led a group of mercenary pilots to a

    meeting of Guristas officials, he made a grave error in employing an illegal clone
    as a decoy. The clone escaped and turned itself in, and the original man was forced
    to disappear again.


    #### YC 108


    The capture of a large convoy of Taladigi Transport & Trading Corporation vessels
    carrying a classified Caldari Navy shipment was turned into trap when the emptied
    vessels were set up to lure a group of investigators. Kilroy Eckheart, head of
    security for TT&T was joined by a large enough capsuleer force that they were
    able to destroy the guarding Guristas fleet. While TT&T continued to try and fulfil
    the

    contract with smaller and faster shipments, their transports continued to get
    destroyed. Seeking vengeance against the Guristas by baiting them with leaked
    information on the convoys, Eckheart nonetheless failed in his attempts, despite
    having capsuleer backup. The entire debacle resulted in TT&T losing their contract
    with the Caldari Navy.


    #### YC 109


    The kidnapping of Innovaatio scientists went south when the sole surviving scientist
    was able to send out a distress signal to Internal Security. The scientist, involved
    in prototype cloaking technology, would have made a valuable resource. Unfortunately
    a rescue fleet was able to extract the gravely wounded person.


    #### YC 110


    A raid upon two storage and warehousing facilities owned by FedMart caught media
    attention when it turned out that Wiyrkomi facilities in the same system were
    left alone, and that Wiyrkomi Peace Corp forces did not respond to the distress
    calls of the FedMart personal. Speculation was raised that the State chose to
    turn a blind eye in order to protect their infrastructure.


    Also this year, The Guristas unsuccessfully applied for participation in the 5th
    Alliance tournament. The official reason given was that the Guristas are not technically
    an alliance, nor are they a pod-pilot-only organization, and that furthermore
    they applied too late. The Guristas however simply concluded that the Mercantile
    Club excluded them because of their reputation.


    #### YC 111


    A series of raids by Ishukone Watch to crack down on aiding piracy and corporate
    corruption led to a loss of infiltrants and insider sources within Ishukone. This
    followed an already increased support of anti-piracy and corruption operations
    which had in the past led to the exchange of gunfire. The raids appear to have
    been a sudden decision, causing the Watch to move in on targets that were already
    under

    surveillance in an attempt to capture as many as possible.'

description: Guristas Pirates Founded by the charismatic Fatal and technically-minded
  Rabbit, the Guristas pirates are a fearless, professional and highly-organized outfit
  operating out of their home region of Venal. Unlike other rogue factions, their
  activities are based not around any twisted ideology or creed, but rather a good
  old-fashioned lust for wealth and power. The Guristas focus primarily on interstellar
  piracy in the outer regions and low-security space. The Guristas maintain hundreds
  of deadspace [...]
