    Assembly, or CONCORD Assembly as it has become known, was founded over a century
    ago, after the five empires initially established contact with each other.\n\nFrom
    the outset interstellar relations were strained. That being the case, the main
    purpose of an agency like CONCORD was to ease the tension and create a foundation
    for peaceful cooperation between the empires. This endeavor is widely regarded
    as a success, given that while several flare-ups have occurred, and indeed the
    empires have come to blows since CONCORD\u2019s formation, a situation of all-out
    war has been avoided through careful mediation and negotiation."

- body: "## History\n\nCONCORD wielded very little power for the first few decades
    of its existence and was used essentially as a form of mediation between the administrations
    of the empires. Initially, the fledgling organization had little diplomatic sway,
    and regulation enforcement would time and time again prove difficult for its agents,
    as they were overruled by local law enforcement and legal representatives from
    the sovereign authorities.\n\nIt was not until eighteen years after its founding
    that CONCORD gained the respect of the international community. After the battle
    of Iyen-Oursta\u2014the bloodiest and most costly engagement the Gallente-Caldari
    War had seen in decades\u2014 both sides were tired of fighting, though long-entrenched
    hatred and pride prevented either side from asking for a cease-fire. CONCORD took
    the initiative, and in just under six months managed to negotiate a peace accord
    between the federation and the state that ended the war and endured for almost
    a century.\n\nIn the last three decades, CONCORD\u2019s authority and influence
    have expanded even further, particularly as interstellar trade has grown into
    the cornerstone of New Eden\u2019s economy and the age of the capsuleer has dawned.
    The growing power of CONCORD has, however, often raised concern within the empires
    that the organization could begin to exercise leverage in areas which have until
    now been regarded as the respective nations\u2019 internal affairs. CONCORD is
    now no longer regarded as a neutral ground for the empires to hammer out diplomatic
    agreements.\n\nIt has become an independent institution that sets its own rules
    and regulations, which it is both willing and able to uphold. The organization\u2019s
    ever-expanding bureaucracy over time subtly smothered its allegiances, so that
    it neither swears fealty to nor answers to any nation. The only hold the empires
    had historically possessed over the organization\u2014that of financial support\u2014has
    in addition been almost completely erased, as revenues from customs, confiscation
    of illegal goods, license sales, and infrastructure management are more than enough
    to keep the organization in the black.\n\nThe organization does, however, continue
    to serve its original purpose: to maintain peace between the core empires, even
    if at times conflict may occur under strictly regulated conditions. A perfect
    example of this was during late YC 110, when a fleet belonging to the Minmatar
    Elders and the Thukker tribe conducted a strike against the organization\u2019s
    core communications hub, crippling its rapid-response teams and enabling the Elders
    to mount a large-scale offensive against the Amarr Empire. This marked the beginning
    of what would become known as the Elder War.\n\nCONCORD returned to a semblance
    of functionality in short order, but the damage was already done: tensions had
    boiled over into conflict. While CONCORD imposed peace enough to maintain the
    status quo and keep New Eden from slipping into anarchy, the hostilities already
    invoked would not be quelled. Using auxiliary forces composed of capsuleer paramilitaries
    as defined under the CONCORD Emergency Militia War Powers Act Rev. 2 of YC 110,
    the nations of New Eden today fight a war via proxy under the watchful gaze of
    CONCORD, which still struggles to rebuild and redefine itself after suffering
    that colossal blow to its infrastructure."

- body: "## Structure\n\nThe inner workings of CONCORD are democratic in nature, with
    each of the five empires technically possessing equal say in all matters, although
    typically a nation\u2019s actual pull more often than not will come down to the
    persuasiveness of its delegates on the Inner Circle\u2019s debating floor. In
    reality, while the process is billed as democratic, the ultimate decision lies
    with a majority vote by the five heads of the Inner Circle based on the presentation
    of content delivered by the delegates of the empires.\n\nThe CONCORD Assembly
    itself is divided into three main divisions, each of which handles a certain aspect
    of the organization\u2019s relationship with the empires and independent capsuleers.
    These divisions are all bound by the fourteen articles of the Yulai Convention
    and all associated approved amendments.\n\n### Inner Circle\n\nThe Inner Circle
    is the top-level department of CONCORD. The assembly\u2019s policies are discussed
    and decided on during Inner Circle meetings, which are usually closed to everyone
    other than the five heads of the Inner Circle and the five delegates from the
    core empires. In the early years of CONCORD, the members of the Inner Circle were
    nominated by the empires, whereas today they are employees of CONCORD. This ensures
    that their loyalty is no longer bound to any one empire, but rather to CONCORD
    itself and its policies.\n\nThe Inner Circle is responsible for all high-level
    decision making within CONCORD, as well as the passing of new legislation and
    approval of amendments to existing legal documentation. The Inner Circle\u2019s
    council is made up of the chief executive and the heads of the Inner Circle\u2019s
    four branches: intelligence, administration, advisory, and internal security.
    Each empire selects one delegate to the Inner Circle who is responsible for bringing
    her government\u2019s concerns to CONCORD in weekly status meetings. These delegates,
    with due reason, also have the authority to request that the Inner Circle convene
    in an emergency situation.\n\n### Directive Enforcement Department\n\nThe Directive
    Enforcement Department, also known simply as the DED, is the police force of CONCORD
    and maintains by far the strongest armed forces and fleet in New Eden. The prime
    responsibility of the DED is to track and bring to justice high-profile criminals.
    To this end, it often hires independent contractors, such as bounty hunters and
    private investigators, to assist with its actions. The DED handles the licenses
    and legal issues of all bounty hunters for the empires, although some of the empires
    have bypassed the DED\u2019s approval under extenuating circumstances. Typically
    the most notorious criminals are simply marked as free-for-all targets by the
    DED and are assigned a bounty, allowing them to be brought to justice by any capable
    party.\n\nThe DED also assists in aiding customs officials in patrolling areas
    where smuggling is rife. In addition, the department takes care of all kinds of
    security issues regarding high-profile meetings and conferences between the empires,
    providing venue security, vessel escorts in space, and personal bodyguards. DED
    forces also often support local law enforcement in dealing with large-scale criminal
    activity or similar matters. For this the DED often uses their special forces
    unit, named Special Affairs for Regulations and Order, or SARO.\n\nSARO is widely
    regarded as the most extensively trained, skilled, and hardened law enforcement
    agency in the cluster, and its exploits are a constantly recurring subject in
    popular entertainment across New Eden, though to vastly differing degrees of realism.
    SARO is used mostly in hostage situations, tactical assaults on heavily armed
    pirate havens, and similar high-risk engagements with a low margin for error.\n\n###
    Secure Commerce Commission\n\nThe Secure Commerce Commission, or SCC for short,
    wasf ounded with the realization of the need for a centralized, impartial agency
    to govern and manage interstellar trade and mediate on trade-related disputes
    between the empires.\n\nAs soon as individual regions began to set up trade routes
    and a regional market network of trade hubs emerged where traders were able to
    view everything for sale anywhere in the region and put their own items up for
    sale, there arose the need for a centralized agency responsible for interstellar
    commerce and the regulation and monitoring of trade. As a division within CONCORD,
    the SCC is jointly run by the empires and thus ensures a safe and universally
    regulated trade environment for all merchants, regardless of their nationality
    or creed.\n\nCONCORD oversight ensures that the SCC, although effectively under
    the control of the empires in its jurisdiction, acts under the strictest neutrality
    codes, the same as Interbus and other empire-run institutions. This is to ensure
    that all dealings are not only secure, but are in line with both local and CONCORD
    law, with no chance of governmental interference and no possibility for discrimination
    based on a merchant\u2019s origins.\n\nAlso governed by the Yulai Convention,
    the SCC ensures fair trade for all merchants and independent capsuleers, along
    with monitoring and regulating corporate trading and exchange of currency across
    interstellar borders. The SCC also contains a subdivision known as the Commerce
    Assessment Department, or CAD, which specifically oversees interstellar trade
    agreements and monitors cross-regional trade."

- body: "## Fleet Composition\n\nWhile the actual capability of CONCORD\u2019s fleet
    remains highly classified, the origins of the technology behind it are widely
    known under the assembly\u2019s own freedom of information clause within the Yulai
    Convention. Consisting of only three basic hull types, the fleet benefits from
    a mixture of technology from all four empires that produces what most consider
    to be the ultimate in state-of-the-art combat vessels.\n\nWhile exact technical
    specifics are unknown, it is widely known that the vessels utilize a sensor system
    like no other, possessing sensor subsystems from all four core empires that run
    both ladar and radar arrays, as well as gravimetric and magnometric pulse scanning.
    All CONCORD vessels also utilize a Carthum Conglomerate\u2013sourced antimatter
    reactor unit design, as well as interleaved tungsten carbide armor plating from
    Khanid Innovations.\n\nShield systems are sourced from the laboratories of the
    Ishukone Corporation, along with onboard Quantum computing systems, with oscillator
    capacitor reservoirs provided by Roden Shipyards, and plasma propulsion systems
    from Boundless Creations.\n\nWith a universally recognizable profile, the external
    designs of CONCORD\u2019s fleet have remained the same for almost a century, making
    them unmistakable whenever they are spotted patrolling the space lanes. However,
    beneath the surface, the vessels receive regular and extremely rigorous updates,
    with the DED\u2019s operational policy denoting an inspection and refit requirement
    for every six months of service to ensure that all vessels remain at the cutting
    edge of technology.\n\n### Marshal-Class Battleship\n\nThe Marshal class is probably
    the most iconic of all battleships in the cluster and is instantly recognizable
    as a peacekeeping vessel wherever it may patrol. Based on the subframe and keel
    design of the Amarrian Apocalypse-class battleship, the Marshal is regarded as
    the most solid heavy-weapons platform in existence, with its basic hull design
    having been in service for ninety-five years as of YC 115.\n\nConstantly in a
    state of update, the vessel\u2019s highly advanced subsystems are able to support
    both turret and launcher capability simultaneously, in addition to providing the
    infrastructure for some of the most versatile defensive capabilities in existence.
    This ensures that the Marshal remains a fierce assault platform, always at the
    forefront of the battle, with the staying power to match its offensive ability.\n\n###
    Enforcer-Class Cruiser\n\nBased on a hybrid of the subframes of the Moa-class
    and Vexor-class cruisers, the Enforcer utilizes many of the existing subsystems
    from the two cruisers it shares its origins with. An extremely iconic ship featured
    in most of CONCORD\u2019s anticrime and recruitment media, the Enforcer is designed
    as a fast-attack cruiser for mobile patrol and customs service.\n\nBilled as the
    most versatile cruiser class in the cluster, it features an extremely powerful
    antimatter reactor unit sourced from Carthum Conglomerate. This is rumored to
    encourage most combat-seasoned DED officers to outfit it with oversized propulsion
    modules in order to take advantage of its light, flexible, and fast subframe.\n\n###
    Pacifier-Class Frigate\n\nNotorious in the outer regions, the Pacifier-class frigate
    has made its name as the premier fast-attack frigate in the cluster, laying waste
    even to the Angel Cartel\u2019s legendary Dramiel class. Based on the relatively
    heavy Punisher-class chassis, the Pacifier benefits from a scaled-up and oversized
    Boundless Creations\u2013designed plasma propulsion system based on that of the
    Rifter-class frigate and shares most of its targeting subsystems with the Wolf-class
    assault frigate.\n\nWith an oscillator capacitor reservoir that rivals those of
    most light, fast cruisers, the Pacifier is ideal for extended periods of fast
    pursuit and serves as the primary scouting and interdiction vessel for the Directive
    Enforcement Department. Among smugglers, the Pacifier has the reputation of being
    almost impossible to outrun in pursuit and has led most in this profession to
    resort to all kinds of tactics in an effort to avoid coming into contact with
    the vessel outright."

- body: "## Notable Characters\n\n### Odo Korachi\n\nKorachi is often seen on patrol
    in command of a Marshal-class battleship and leads the DED\u2019s Genesis Fleet,
    which is primarily charged with peacekeeping and ensuring a state of relative
    calm among the independent capsuleer population. Born in YC 33, Korachi served
    with the Caldari Navy for a little over a decade before resigning his commission
    and requesting a transfer to the Directive Enforcement Department. Approaching
    four decades of service as of YC 115, two of those spent as brigadier general
    of the Genesis Fleet, he is well known for his sarcastic wit and no-nonsense,
    direct approach to ensuring that CONCORD law is upheld.\n\n### Irhes Angireh\n\nRegarded
    by her colleagues as a woman who remains impossibly difficult to read, Angireh
    has served as the chief executive of the Inner Circle for eleven years as of YC
    115. Of Amarrian descent, she emigrated to Yulai from the empire at the age of
    eighteen, in YC 55, as the daughter of the former Amarrian ambassador to the Inner
    Circle, Sokra Angireh. After over fifty years serving with the Inner Circle, she
    remains a stoic, logical, and almost cold presence at every Inner Circle meeting
    and a force to be reckoned with in the council\u2019s debating chamber.\n\n###
    Arve Vesren\n\nOne of many capsuleers serving with the Directive Enforcement Department,
    Vesren answers only to Kjersidur Elladall, chief executive and commanding officer
    of the DED. A former Caldari servicewoman of some fifteen years, spent as a wing
    commander with the Lai Dai Protection Service, she has served the Directive Enforcement
    Department for a little over three decades as of YC 115, nine of those years as
    director of operations, with an impeccable service record.\n\nVesren is regarded
    as a driven, ambitious, and direct woman, unafraid to challenge the leadership
    decisions of those above her and swift to dispense justice to the full extent
    of the law. Most criminals see the direct attraction of her attention to their
    business as an immediate swan song, a notification of their imminent removal from
    the criminal underworld, the physical world, or both.\n\n### Eman Autrech\n\nA
    man of Gallente blood born in the Caldari State, Autrech is the unsung hero who
    some believed prevented complete economic collapse in the wake of the One-Day
    War on June 10, YC 110, by preventing the four core empires from ceasing trade
    after the attacks on CONCORD headquarters and demanding that the Interstellar
    Stock Exchange remain open.\n\nEducated at the Caldari State\u2019s Science and
    Trade Institute, Autrech is regarded as one of the most intelligent business and
    trade moguls in the cluster, with his finger firmly on the pulse of interstellar
    markets. He has served as CEO of the SCC for twenty-six years as of YC 115, and
    his devotion to ensuring the fairness and equality of interstellar trade has earned
    him a great deal of respect among his colleagues."
