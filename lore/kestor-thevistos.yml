    heritage, is the Chief Gravometrics Engineer for [Project Skymother](56jHURaqYy9SzmHignb3Wz)
    at [Core Complexion](u4esGMynVEZ2DaTh3uuiY).\n\n## Biography\n\nKestor was born
    on [Matar](5gheCRHTWLbi5jzbo5vvT6) and lived in a [pidouk](uJvGA26HnleWDor1TeFpo)
    until early adulthood with his father [Ziather](rVmEewsC6fvvI0zQtjtBR) and sister
    [Cliemne](ND0owY6yQCOGJGhBhIfNw). His youth was somewhat tumultuous, as Kestor
    had trouble behaving in school and would often argue with his father. Their conflicts
    generally centered on Kestor\u2019s grandfather, who raised Ziather to follow
    the [Amarr](7BDNWe469BCdW0xdEmkWr7) faith even after being freed from slavery.
    Kestor took issue with Ziather comparing him to his grandfather, suggesting they
    were alike, as well as Ziather\u2019s insistence that Kestor was throwing away
    his talents by spending time with \u201Cworthless friends\u201D.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t
    until Kestor met Dr. Chieran Kenitawri that he revised his outlook on life. The
    scientist\u2019s friendship and advice inspired the young man to take his studies
    at the Republic University seriously. Chieran quickly gained sufficient confidence
    in Kestor to bring him into Project Skymother as an intern. This experience allowed
    Kestor to finish his program early and graduate in YC112 with a degree in gravitational
    physics. Chieran immediately had Kestor hired as Chief Gravometrics Engineer of
    the project.\n\n## Dropheads Assault\n\nIn YC111, while accompanying Cliemne to
    the Shishaan Center for the Performing Arts, Kestor encountered a couple of Dropheads
    who had been giving Cliemne a hard time. They were of the opinion she and Kestor
    were not \u201Clocal enough\u201D because of Ziather\u2019s religious beliefs.
    When Kestor told them to back off, the Dropheads assaulted him before running
    away.\n\nThis incident gained significant media and political attention on Matar
    due to it being a hate crime perpetrated by Minmatar against the son of a former
    slave. As a result, Kestor was taken to a special Core Complexion hospital to
    receive top-level medical treatment to ensure his full recovery. By chance, Dr.
    Chieran Kenitawri was being treated in the room across the hall from Kestor, which
    allowed the two to meet and develop a friendship.\n\n## See Also\n* [Chronicle:
