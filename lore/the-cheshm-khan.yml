- body: 'The __Cheshm Khan__ is a security and intelligence agency of the Khanid Kingdom
    that answers directly to the King. In effect, the Cheshm Khan is the royal secret
    police force and perhaps the organization that the average subject of the Khanid
    Kingdom fears most.


    As a critical element in the power apparatus of the King, the Cheshm Khan has
    almost unlimited call on the resources of the Kingdom. It is notorious for the
    cold brutality of its methods but is respected by competitors as a genuinely effective
    security intelligence service. Its ruthlessness and ability to obtain results
    is such that it has been compared to the Federation''s Black Eagles intelligence
    agency.


    Within the greater Amarr Empire, the Cheshm Khan is ranked for effectiveness alongside
    the Imperial Guard''s Surveillance Brigade and the Amarr Naval Intelligence Service.


    The Cheshm Khan''s habit of securing sources of information and advantageous strategic
    partnerships in foreign states, as well as across the Amarr Empire, has given
    it a keener edge than most other Amarr intelligence agencies, which tend to be
    vast, unwieldy and rather inward-looking institutions.


    Within the Kingdom, the Cheshm Khan has a pointed rivalry with the Royal Intelligence
    and Signals Command, an agency controlled by the Royal Khanid Navy''s Admiralty.
