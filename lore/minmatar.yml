- body: "## Minmatar Republic\n\nOf the four major races of New Eden, none has endured
    more tragedy and suffering than the Minmatar. Once part of a thriving and technologically
    capable tribal civilization, billions of Matari were enslaved by the Amarr Empire
    for more than seven hundred years, until a mass rebellion freed most, but not
    all, of those held in servitude. Initially modeling its recovery after Gallente
    Federation notions of democracy, the Minmatar Republic was born through the cooperation
    of four major tribes.\n\nThe Minmatar are the most numerous of all the races in
    New Eden, but their vast numbers are dispersed widely and divided into many factions.
    While the Minmatar Republic is the official state, only a quarter of all Minmatar
    currently alive are part of it. A very large proportion, almost a third, remains
    enslaved within the huge Amarr Empire, while a fifth resides within the Gallente
    Federation, creating a powerful political bloc that contributes in no small part
    to the constant state of tension between Gallente and Amarr.\n\nThe remainder,
    who are not part of any formal organization, live as freemen throughout the world.
    Many are itinerant laborers, roaming from one system to another in search of work.
    A fair number make their living on the darker side of the law, acting as pirates,
    smugglers, and peddlers in all kinds of illegal goods. It is worth noting that
    many of the larger criminal groups in New Eden are run by people of Minmatar heritage.\n\nThe
    free Minmatar peoples are resilient, ingenious, and hard working. Perhaps most
    of all they are proud, and many of them believe that democracy, though it served
    them well at first, will never restore what was taken from them by the Amarr Empire.
    As all seven tribes of Matar have united again and found a new sense of their
    identity in the Empyrean Age, the development of the Minmatar Republic has swung
    away from Gallente ideas of unadulterated democracy. The Minmatar have created
    a form of government truly reflective of their historical tribal culture. Almost
    invariably they remain deeply attached to their enslaved kindred and will go to
    extraordinary lengths to recover them. The Minmatar will forever resent the Amarr
    and yearn for the days before the empire\u2019s accursed ships ever reached their
    home world."

    Origins\n\nIn AD 8017, the Terran explorers of the CMS-17 system were delighted
    to discover two temperate planets in the circumstellar habitable zone, and even
    more so when they found that one of these worlds, the fourth planet from the sun,
    was blessed with particularly hospitable conditions. News of these discoveries
    made the CMS-17 system a prime target for colonization, and it was soon renamed
    \u201CPator,\u201D with the fourth planet becoming known as \u201CMatar.\u201D\n\nMatar
    was quickly colonized by numerous expeditions attracted by the prospect of settling
    a world that would require no terraforming and very likely support self-sustaining
    colonies. Indeed, when the EVE Gate closed, most of the settlements on Matar survived
    and even prospered once they recovered from the initial crisis. Over the centuries
    these colonies lost their advanced technologies, as a lack of supplies and the
    loss of knowledge led to an inevitable breakdown.\n\n### The Minmatar Empire\n\nOver
    the next ten thousand years, several distinct civilizations developed on Matar
    and gradually became aware of one another, as technological advances allowed for
    regular trade. Certain legends and fragmentary histories indicate that internecine
    warfare between the tribes, and even between clans of the same tribe, was commonplace
    in the early period of the world. In the end, perhaps promoted by a combination
    of trade and the spread of a mystic belief system, the tribes understood that
    cooperation was a far better way than war.\n\nAfter a general peace between the
    tribes was established in AD 20374, a global culture developed, and the Minmatar
    eventually unified in a loose empire. Minmatar technology developed at a respectable
    pace in this period, and a little over a millennium later they made their way
    into space. As well as colonizing much of the Pator system, the Minmatar Empire
    was able to settle colonies on a number of planets and moons in several local
    systems, usually depending on ancient star gates but initially using ships accelerated
    to near light speed.\n\n### The Day of Darkness\n\nDespite having made great strides
    in space technology, the Minmatar Empire did not manage to expand very far or
    develop a large space fleet before its fateful first encounter with another empire:
    the Amarr Empire. A theocratic state driven by its religion to \u201CReclaim\u201D
    the stars and all living around them, the Amarr Empire had managed to reverse
    engineer star gate technology and occupy a great swath of star systems. In AD
    22355, after detecting the Minmatar Empire\u2019s presence and evaluating its
    capabilities, the Amarr sent a large fleet to the Pator system intent on a grim
    purpose. The day the Amarr fleet entered the Pator system, a great storm blew
    up over the largest continent of the planet Matar.\n\nThe storm was incredibly
    destructive and turned the skies dark, an ill omen that would be remembered as
    the herald of the Amarr fleet. The core of the fleet was made up of six giant
    slaver vessels, each escorted by many heavily armed warships. Each of the slaver
    vessels made for a different planet and, once in orbit, proceeded to land troops
    and round up large numbers of people. The escorting warships took pains to destroy
    every Minmatar spaceship, satellite, and station they encountered. Surface installations
    of military or space-industrial value were systematically bombarded. The Minmatar
    armed forces tried bravely to resist but were crushed by the superior arms and
    technology of the Amarr slavers.\n\nOn that day the Amarr took hundreds of millions
    of slaves, depopulating most of the colony worlds they invaded and wreaking havoc
    on Matar. The day itself, by association with the black storm it began with and
    to underline the horror of the deeds the Amarr carried out, became known as the
    Day of Darkness.\n\n### Conquest and Occupation\n\nFor a little over a century
    after their first incursion, the Amarr continued to make slave raids on the Minmatar
    Empire. In this period, for all practical purposes, the Minmatar Empire ceased
    to exist, as the Minmatar colonies were cut off from Matar and eventually left
    empty and ruined. Matar itself entered a period of chaos, as the global infrastructure
    that had been created was wrecked by successive slave raids. Finally, in AD 22480,
    Emperor Damius III ordered the conquest and occupation of Matar. The entire Minmatar
    race was to be subjugated and enslaved. As with each time they had been raided,
    the Minmatar attempted to resist, but no power left to them could stop the Amarr
    from conquering their world. With the exception of a few mountain strongholds
    and secret resistance cells, the Amarr quite easily achieved global domination
    of Matar. Every remaining Minmatar colony world was likewise invaded and placed
    under the rule of Amarr holders.\n\nFor the next seven hundred years or so, the
    Minmatar lived under Amarr occupation and enslavement. Many hundreds of millions
    of Minmatar were shipped across the Amarr Empire as slaves. The Amarr always crushed
    what rebellions occurred with utter ruthlessness and brutality. The uprising of
    the Starkmanir tribe some 450 years after their conquest was deemed so serious\u2014and
    indeed a royal heir of House Ardishapur was killed in this rebellion\u2014that
    the tribe was ordered annihilated by orbital bombardment. Later events showed
    that the genocide, while it killed the vast majority of the once-largest tribe
    of the Minmatar, was not complete.\n\nHowever, so far as anyone at the time was
    concerned, the Starkmanir had been destroyed, and inevitably the story and its
    symbols, notably that of the khumaak, spread among the Minmatar. From that time
    on, if they had not known it before, the Minmatar knew that one day they must
    all fight to be free of their overlords.\n\n### The Great Rebellion\n\nA little
    over 250 years after the annihilation of the Starkmanir, the four great star empires
    of the Amarr, Caldari, Gallente, and Jove had come into contact with one another.
    The Jove had limited their contact with the others and, while it was clear they
    were technologically advanced, their true capabilities and motives were a mystery
    to the other nations. The Gallente Federation and the Caldari State, for their
    part, were still at war, but their conflict had bogged down into a stalemate.
    The Gallente, libertarians by instinct and prone to intervention, had become aware
    of the plight of the Minmatar and were appalled by it. Over the preceding centuries,
    the Minmatar resistance had organized itself and even achieved the capability
    to mount raids on Amarrian installations. The Gallente Federation secretly aided
    this resistance in every way it could.\n\nAgainst this background, the Amarr Empire
    was feeling increasingly uneasy at the presence of several rival powers along
    its borders. As so often before, the Amarr decided that they must act according
    to their doctrine of \u201CReclaiming\u201D and chose the Jove Empire for a demonstration
    of Amarrian might. The Amarr had concluded that the Jovians were hiding weakness
    behind a cloak of mystery and a few minor technological advances. Consequently,
    in AD 23216, the Amarr sent a fleet of two hundred warships to a system they called
    Vak\u2019Atioth, a fringe holding of the Jove Empire, where the Amarr intended
    to crush the Jovian presence and begin a new campaign of conquest. The Amarr had
    not been shy about the matter of their intentions and all their propaganda for
    weeks past had made it clear they intended to act against the Jove. For their
    part, the Jovians had made sure to infiltrate the highest levels of the Amarr
    government and military. When the Amarr fleet entered Vak\u2019Atioth, the Jovians
    were waiting.\n\nThe ensuing Battle of Vak\u2019Atioth was notable in several
    ways: it was the first defeat, and a crushing one at that, of an Amarr war fleet
    by another race; it was the first and last time that the Jovians engaged in battle
    with another race, at least so far as the other races knew; and it was the first
    and last time that a Jovian mother ship was seen in battle. The Amarr reaction
    to their defeat was to prepare a second, larger fleet to attack the Jovians. At
    this time, as news of the first Amarr fleet\u2019s defeat spread throughout the
    empire, the Minmatar resistance sent the signal to their people to rise up against
    the Amarr. Faced by a large, well-equipped rebellion on multiple worlds, the Amarr
    had no choice but to sue for peace with the Jovians and see to the flames spreading
    across their empire.\n\nThe Great Rebellion made fantastic gains in its first
    days, the Amarr occupation of Matar was lifted, and those Amarr unable to flee
    the planet found as little mercy at the hands of the Matari as they had shown
    their erstwhile slaves. The Amarr occupation fleet was driven out of Pator in
    some disarray, the shock of the defeat at Vak\u2019Atioth seemingly deeply demoralizing
    the Amarr military. This pattern was repeated in most of the systems previously
    controlled by the old Minmatar Empire and many others besides in the coming months
    and years. The Amarr only stabilized the situation in the end by establishing
    and massively bolstering the Ammatar Mandate\u2014a puppet state nominally ruled
    by the Nefantar, a Minmatar tribe that had always collaborated with the Amarr
    and fled with them from the wrath of the free tribes during the rebellion. By
    this time the free Matari had consolidated their hold over a considerable number
    of systems, giving them a firm base on which to establish a new nation: the Minmatar
    Republic.\n\n### The Early Republic\n\nWith the aid of the Gallente Federation,
    the free Minmatar rapidly established their new nation-state as a parliamentary
    republic. The Minmatar Republic\u2019s first concern was the security of its new
    borders and its second was to develop a self-sustaining industrial base. The new
    republic willingly participated in the CONCORD Assembly when it was founded in
    AD 23233, even if it meant entering into diplomacy with the hated Amarr. They
    also took part in the Yoiul Conference and adopted the new standard time and calendar
    of New Eden.\n\nThe Minmatar tribes accepted that much of the management of the
    new republic would have to be overseen by the Republic Parliament and its agencies.
    Gallente aid was essential in these early days, and federation notions of democracy
    were accepted without too much scrutiny. To many Minmatar, they were a breath
    of fresh air after the horrors of the Amarr occupation. Even so, some Minmatar
    were not so sure about the republic, and the Thukker tribe decided they wanted
    no part of it, choosing to take their spacefaring caravans to the Great Wildlands
    region. Others could not adjust to civil society and democratic politics, variously
    carrying on the fight against the Amarr as terrorists, joining criminal cartels,
    or taking themselves into space as wanderers.\n\nMany Minmatar, on the other hand,
    were very taken with Gallente ideals and chose to migrate to the federation rather
    than help build a new Minmatar society. Over time more and more Minmatar took
    this path, with the effect that Gallente influence over the republic as a whole
    waned. Resentment of those who had left the Minmatar Republic became common, and
    those most enamored of Gallente ways tended to be among those emigrating to the
    federation. By YC 110, the Minmatar Republic had started to undergo a \u201Ctribal
    renaissance,\u201D as the tribal heritage and culture of the Minmatar increasingly
    influenced the society and politics of the republic.\n"

- body: "## Tribes\n\nThe Minmatar Republic is very much based on tribal society.
    The Republic's justice system is handled on a tribal level. Tribes have their
    own courts and judgment halls.\n\nThe Minmatar people are divided into seven major
    tribes: Sebiestor, Krusual, Brutor, Vherokior, Nefantar, Thukker, and Starkmanir.
    Most of these tribes are composed of a number of different clans, in some cases
    many hundreds. The history of the Minmatar has resulted in very different situations
    for several of these tribes. The Minmatar Republic was founded by the Brutor,
    Krusual, Sebiestor, and Vherokior tribes. These have sometimes been called the
    \u201CRepublic Tribes.\u201D \n\nThe Thukker, Starkmanir, and Nefantar have each
    gone their own way in the past, either by choice or by tragic fate, and their
    place in the new Tribal Republic remains very much in flux. Many Nefantar, Starkmanir
    and Thukker have returned to join with the others, reuniting the Seven Tribes
    of Matar.\n\n### Sebiestor\n\nThe [Sebiestor Tribe](7kXWkELR06UO0a2sXUqSMT) are
    technically and mechanically inclined, much Minmatar technology comes from them.
    The Sebiestors have always been a leading tribe in the Minmatar Republic, though
    their authority has many times been under attack from the crafty Krusual tribe,
    their main rivals in Republic politics.\n\nWith a culture emphasizing the virtues
    of patience, contemplation, and practical skill, the Sebiestor are known far and
    wide as engineers and inventors. The Sebiestor reputation for tinkering with any
    kind of technology is well deserved, and this excellence in engineering naturally
    propelled the Sebiestor to the fore during the period when the old Minmatar Empire
    pushed into space. \n\nDuring the Amarr occupation, the Sebiestor did much to
    hold what remained of Minmatar society together with their skill at maintaining
    or adapting technology. The Sebiestor Tribe was one of the four founding tribes
    of the Minmatar Republic following the success of the Great Rebellion.\n\n###
    Brutor\n\nThe [Brutor Tribe](qhqrxJmGVttqE7XCPJOZ2) suffered the worst under the
    Amarr occupation \u2013 aside from the massacre of the Starkmanir \u2013 and many
    are still enslaved within the Amarr Empire. This fuels their hate for the Amarrians
    and they are the only tribe to actively pursue a continuation of the war against
    the Amarrians and their underlings, the Ammatars.\n\nThe Brutor are marked by
    a disciplined stoicism and deeply spiritual cast of mind that combine to project
    a sense of nobility around the people of this tribe. While the Brutor have a traditional
    mindset, they suffered great loss of cultural heritage and knowledge of their
    history during the Amarr occupation. To the occasional annoyance of the other
    tribes, the Brutor consider themselves responsible for the freedom of the entire
    Minmatar people and make no bones about standing on this claim for political purposes
    when it suits them. \n\nIn particular, the Brutor are great supporters and protectors
    of the Starkmanir Tribe, on account of the former originating as an offshoot of
    the latter. The Brutor Tribe was one of the four founding tribes of the Minmatar
    Republic following the success of the Great Rebellion.\n\n### Krusual\n\nThe [Krusual
    Tribe](2HXfCmJBZuro24mXLkYYuM) is cautious and cunning, shrouding its ways in
    subterfuge and secrecy. It is isolationist by nature, but lately it's been becoming
    more and more involved with the power politics of the Republic, staking a claim
    for its mastery.\n\nPride is a common Minmatar trait, but the Krusual are wont
    to take it to extraordinary lengths. They rarely lose an opportunity to remind
    the other tribes that they alone managed to maintain strongholds in the mountainous
    Tronhadar region of Matar during the Amarr occupation. It is certainly remarkable
    that in all the long years of the occupation, the Amarr were unable to once and
    for all crush Krusual resistance. \n\nTheir ability to hold onto a certain amount
    of independence during the occupation resulted in the Krusual retaining more of
    their pre-conquest culture than any other tribe, and their underground bases played
    an important role in sheltering some Vherokior mystics. The Krusual Tribe was
    one of the four founding tribes of the Minmatar Republic following the success
    of the Great Rebellion.\n\n### Vherokior\n\nThe [Vherokior Tribe](0KnQG5EbV25faEyIwmbgf)
    is perhaps the least troubled of the Minmatar tribes, with little aspiration for
    dominance, content to live on the fringe. Most Vherokiors are shop-keepers or
    small scale businessmen, seldom venturing into the interstellar corporate leagues.\n\nVherokior
    are disinclined to engage in great collective efforts, and their various clans
    are rather loosely grouped under the tribal chief\u2019s authority. Indeed, the
    clans themselves hold nominal authority in many cases, with the family being by
    far the most important social unit to the individual Vherokior. These families
    are traditionally matriarchal in structure, though the aftermath of the Amarrian
    occupation has disrupted this pattern somewhat, as with so many other aspects
    of Minmatar tribal culture. \n\nMost Vherokior have long-abandoned the ancient
    nomadism of their tribe but the Vherokior mystics are the guardians of the Voluval
    Ritual and travel immense distances in this role. The Vherokior Tribe was one
    of the four founding tribes of Minmatar Republic following the success of the
    Great Rebellion.\n\n### Nefantar\n\nThe [Nefantar Tribe](1lfEcB4SdrV3EJIrmYWOK2)
    played a notorious role during the Amarr Empire's occupation of the Minmatar home
    worlds as collaborators who actively assisted in the enslavement of other tribes
    by the Amarr. The Nefantar were so faithful to the Amarr that Emperor Damius III
    bestowed the name \"Ammatar\" upon them. When the Great Rebellion succeeded in
    driving the Amarr from the Minmatar Regions they were also driven out.The Amarr
    subsequently set up the Nefantar in a puppet state called the [Ammatar Mandate](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz).
    Unbeknownst to anyone else, certain Ammatar elites had hidden a large number of
    Starkmanir Tribe survivors from the Amarr within the Mandate.\n\nAfter the discovery
    of the Starkmanir led to a Minmatar invasion in YC110, the Nefantar conspirators
    and their families led a mass defection of many Ammatar back to the Minmatar Republic,
    assisting in the recovery of the Starkmanir. Today, the Nefantar tribe has been
    restored as one of the Seven Tribes of Matar, even while many of their tribe remain
    loyal to the Amarr Empire back in the Mandate.\n\n### Thukker\n\nThe [Thukker](w6xVrBTtdfBpOXVh5V2m7),
    a nomadic tribe, are scattered throughout the world of New Eden, surviving through
    self-sufficiency and skill as much as possible in the wastelands of space. Their
    tribal bindings are very loose and many of them don't even consider themselves
    to be a part of a tribe any longer, having rejected many of the strongest traditions
    of the Minmatar. They are trained to handle unforeseen circumstances and encouraged
    to rely on their judgement and intuition.\n\nThe closest thing the Thukker have
    got to home is the Great Wildlands region, where they are very numerous, but the
    Thukkers like to be on the move, constantly going from one solar system to another
    in their huge caravans, trading and scavenging. Many frown upon the Thukkers,
    considering them to be nothing but scoundrels and thieves. Indeed, the Thukkers
    often operate on the shadier side of the law, but their resourcefulness and diligence
    count a lot more for their success than their criminal activities.\n\nAccording
    to what remains of the historical records of the Minmatar, the Thukker tribe had
    always been a nomadic people, journeying back and forth across Matar in large
    caravans. The development of the old Minmatar Empire appears to have done little
    to inhibit the wandering of the Thukker. Indeed, the Great Caravanserai itself
    was constructed by the Thukker long ago to serve as a major junction in their
    network of routes and caravanserais. The Amarr found the Thukker intractable and
    many escaped to remote areas of space, forming the nucleus of the later culture
    of Great Caravans.\n\nThe Thukker were notable fighters in the Great Rebellion
    but declined to join in the founding of the Republic. The wanderering Thukker
    Tribe officially joined the Republic in YC111, maintaining full autonomy of their
    Great Wildlands region but once more uniting the Minmatar as seven tribes.\n\n###
    Starkmanir\n\nSubjected to an Amarr campaign of annihilation after a rebellion
    four centuries ago, with barely a handful remaining as slaves within the Amarr
    Empire, the [Starkmanir Tribe](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw) was considered lost for
    centuries until the discovery in YC110 of a viable surviving population hidden
    by Nefantar elites on Halturzhan, the sixth planet of Jarizza in the Ammatar Mandate.
    \n\nThe discovery spurred a Minmatar fleet into an invasion of Amarr territories
    with a view to recovering the Starkmanir and as many other enslaved Minmatar as
    possible. The vast majority of surviving Starkmanir were successfully recovered,
    evacuated to the Minmatar Republic, and settled on lands set aside for them by
    the larger tribes.\n\nThough few in number, the Starkmanir have full status as
    one of the Seven Tribes of Matar and govern their affairs through a council of
    clan chiefs headed by the overall chief of the Starkmanir Tribe."

- body: "## Political Structure\n\nThe Minmatar Republic of today is a tribal republic
    with some democratic aspects. \n\nIn the republic\u2019s first phase, which for
    practical purposes lasted until shortly after the start of the Empyrean War in
    YC110, the tribes had no official say in government matters, and the Republic
    Parliament was a very powerful body. This Gallente-inspired political system placed
    the prime minister at the apex of the power structure as head of government and
    de facto head of state. In fact, given the importance of the tribes and their
    sense of sovereignty, the \u201CFirst Republic\u201D did not codify several important
    concepts, such as head of state or supreme judicial authority.\n\nFollowing the
    unopposed election of [Maleatu Shakor](3H5EVyO9kiyIUOEELIqOlV) as prime minister
    and his acclamation as the first [Sanmatar](180IYq6xQy0PzfGH6hLEuO) since the
    Great Rebellion, the political order of the republic was radically altered to
    hand effective power back to the tribes.\n\nSanmatar Shakor ruled by edict, with
    the support of the tribes, and effectively bypassed the parliament. He called
    for a Tribal Assembly, the first gathering of the seven tribes since the Amarrian
    occupation of Matar, and this event resulted in a formal redrafting of the Minmatar
    Republic\u2019s political structure. Today the Tribal Council effectively governs
    all aspects of the republic, foreign and domestic, economic and military. A shift
    back to the old ways has begun, and many would say the era of the democratic experiment
    is over for the Minmatar.\n\n### Tribes of the Republic\n\nThe new republic embodies
    all seven tribes of the Minmatar people, joined together in the union of the republic,
    with each tribe enjoying considerable autonomy. All tribes hold jurisdiction over
    their own members and territory and have their own laws and internal forms of
    government. While individual tribes can differ greatly in these aspects, each
    tribe is ruled by a tribal chief who, in theory, wields supreme authority over
    the tribe.\n\nThe territories of each tribe are extremely scattered, and the relationships
    between them can appear convoluted to the outsider, while seeming entirely natural
    and straightforward to the Minmatar. In a Minmatar star system, it is entirely
    possible to have a planet owned by the Sebiestor, with an orbital station owned
    by the Vherokior tribe, but rented by a Krusual clan, who then employ a circle
    from the Brutor tribe to run security and a Sebiestor circle to administer it.\n\nThe
    tribal chiefs are the heads of their respective tribes, each chosen according
    to the tribe\u2019s laws, for a term dictated by those laws. This results in the
    Tribal Council never being renewed entirely at the same time, which provides longerterm
    continuity than comparable ruling bodies.\n\n### Sanmatar\n\nWhile not the official
    head of state within the republic, the Sanmatar carries out several functions
    that normally apply in states where an individual is head of state. In addition,
    in situations where the whole council cannot or will not attend in its entirety,
    the Sanmatar acts as the recognized head of state. As the council rarely meets
    outside of council meetings this, in effect, means for much of the time the Sanmatar
    is the visible and de facto head of state for the Minmatar Republic.\n\nOnce every
    two years a Tribal Assembly is held to choose a Sanmatar (an old Minmatar title
    of leadership literally translated as \u201Ctrue Matar\u201D). The Sanmatar presides
    over all Tribal Council meetings, acting as a mediator, but carrying no vote in
    council decisions. The Sanmatar\u2019s sole official power is the ability to declare
    an emergency, during which period he is granted complete executive control. However,
    the Tribal Council can vote by simple majority to end the emergency at any time,
    and when they do so, the Sanmatar is removed from office, unless the council votes
    by two-thirds majority to retain the current Sanmatar.\n\n### The Tribal Council\n\nThe
    council meets weekly at the Great Caravanserai on Matar, by ancient tradition
    a neutral ground for the tribes. While most meetings are conducted in person,
    it is sometimes necessary for members to join a meeting remotely via holography.
    In addition, while it is expected that each tribal chief attend all council meetings,
    she is entitled to appoint a second to take her place.\n\nAll meetings are held
    in conclave\u2014that is, in private with public attendance not permitted. The
    prime minister of the republic has a standing invitation to attend but may take
    no part in proceedings. The remit for council meetings is to make final decisions
    on matter presented to them and discuss republic-wide issues formally. The majority
    of the actual political and detail work occurs between formal council meetings.\n\nFor
    some decisions, commissions will be formed to investigate and report back; for
    others, experts will be summoned to be questioned and ministers can be brought
    in to explain their actions. The council has the power to deal with any issues
    as it sees fit, while bearing in mind the internal sovereignty of the tribes.\n\nThe
    Tribal Council sits as the supreme authority over republic matters. While each
    tribe has full autonomy, the council is made up of the tribal chiefs, who in turn
    govern their respective tribes. In essence, all power is held by the council.
    To the majority of Minmatar, this seems only right and proper: the chiefs chosen
    by each tribe are meant to lead.\n\nMost of the actual work is done by lower bodies,
    such as the parliament, and much of the final approval by the council is decided
    beforehand, in any case. The council rarely bothers itself with any issues it
    considers minor, and many items are passed on to respective bodies to handle.
    There is very little bureaucracy in the council; decisions are made or they are
    delegated. There is almost no binding procedure to hinder the workings of the
    Tribal Council.\n\n### The Republic Parliament\n\nThe Republic Parliament is a
    thirty-five-seat house that embodies the legislative and administrative functions
    of the Minmatar Republic. It also takes on any issues passed down to it from the
    Tribal Council. The parliament is directly accountable to the Tribal Council and
    subservient to it in all matters. This, in addition to the fact that each tribe
    functions as an autonomous and internally sovereign body, means that the parliament,
    in contrast to its earlier incarnation, now wields little real power.\n\nMembers
    of Parliament are chosen by the seven individual tribes. The manner and time of
    choosing is left up to the tribes themselves; the only requirement is that each
    tribe fills all five seats in Parliament allocated to them. The term each member
    of Parliament serves is determined by the tribe he represents.\n\n#### Prime Minister\n\nThe
    prime minister is a member of Parliament directly appointed by the Tribal Council
    who serves as the chairperson of the parliament. It is the prime minister\u2019s
    responsibility to guide and direct the parliament. The prime minister also distributes
    issues to be resolved that are handed down by the Tribal Council. The office carries
    with it a standing invitation to attend the Tribal Council as an observer.\n\n####
    Responsibility and Powers\n\nThe parliament is responsible for creating and maintaining
    all legislation relating to the republic as a whole. The parliament has no powers
    over legislation for individual tribes; this is handled by the tribes themselves.\n\nLegislation
    created by the parliament must be ratified by the Tribal Council for it to become
    law. The Tribal Council can repeal or arbitrarily modify any legislation as it
    sees fit. In practice, most laws are simply signed off by the Tribal Council,
    as agreement is usually reached far in advance of it appearing before the council.
    In practice, the amount of legislation needed for the republic is fairly minimal.
    The tribes govern themselves, and any intertribal matters are almost always handled
    between the tribes themselves or arranged between the appropriate parties.\n\nThe
    parliament also deals with issues handed to it by the Tribal Council. The prime
    minister decides how these should be dealt with; usually a small action group
    is formed to assess and deal with the issue at hand. The resolution is then passed
    back up to the council for ratification. The heads of the various administrative
    departments of the republic are chosen by the parliament. Such appointments must
    be ratified by the Tribal Council.\n\n## Republic Justice Department\n\nThe Republic
    Justice Department (RJD) is one of the most powerful and visible of the Minmatar
    Republic\u2019s government bodies. It is responsible for the republic\u2019s courts,
    prisons, and law enforcement. The RJD operates multiple levels of law enforcement.
    There are relatively few police on the ground, mostly at republic institutions
    and areas ungoverned by tribal law. The majority of law enforcement consists of
    large task forces dedicated to rooting out slavery or targeting organized crime
    elements. These two task force functions often overlap.\n\nAs relatively few cases
    fall under republic law\u2014as opposed to tribal law\u2014the RJD has evolved
    to take a leading role in the fight against slavery, prosecuting an aggressive
    campaign against slavers within the republic\u2019s borders, and sometimes beyond.
    The antislavery role has resulted in the Justice Department being held in exceptionally
    high regard within the republic, a fact which the department takes every opportunity
    to capitalize upon, as it makes its work that much more effective.\n\n## Republic
    Security Services\n\nThe Republic Security Services (RSS) are just as dedicated
    as the Justice Department to the freedom of the Minmatar people but have a rather
    more controversial reputation. The RSS are utterly ruthless in their pursuit of
    security for the republic and the Minmatar as a whole. To that end, the RSS operate
    many clandestine cells and do not balk at maintaining links with organized crime
    and other underworld elements. \n\nThe constant rumors of such off-book contacts
    and activities are only given fuel by the strong showing the Krusual make among
    the numbers of the RSS agencies. That tribe\u2019s reputation for guile and deception
    gives many cause for concern when it comes to their apparent influence over the
    RSS, and the impression of Krusual dominance is a significant factor in the controversial
    standing of the security services. Nevertheless, the RSS are seen as a necessary
    evil by most Minmatar and accorded the grudging respect of many across New Eden
    as highly effective operators."

    Tribes and Clans\n\nTo the Minmatar mindset, the most important thing in life
    is to be able to take care of one\u2019s self, and although kin and family are
    important, most Minmatar prefer to identify themselves in terms of clan or tribe
    rather than along family lines. The Vherokior are a notable exception to this,
    having considerable identification with the family, while the Thukker are more
    oriented around their caravans. While the seven great tribes and their different
    ways are the clearest indication of the unique culture of the Minmatar, the fine
    grain of their heritage is given its texture by the clans.\n\nA clan can have
    any number of families of a given tribe in it, and its size is dictated largely
    by the traditional activities of its member families. Most clans have a tendency
    to concentrate on a particular area of industry or related professions. Minmatar
    clans that live mainly on planets might focus on agricultural or heavy industrial
    activities; others who travel around New Eden may concentrate on mercantilism
    or the like\u2014or perhaps pirating. Clans also maintain their special identities
    through artistic and literary pursuits and styles unique to them.\n\nIn the distant
    past, the clans constantly warred against each other. In the larger scheme of
    things, however, the Matari have learned that cooperation is important, and although
    the clans still try to maintain their regional and ideological identities, they
    usually put themselves forward as a unified whole when dealing with other races.
    Clans are distinct from circles in having a much more general social and political
    function, together with having a particular approach to several areas of life,
    such as work, art, and sport. For example, a circle that specializes in electronic
    engineering would not at the same time formally specialize in rhetorical poetry.
    Traditional clans, which most nonrenegade clans are, do not admit members from
    other tribes and usually limit themselves to certain families of the tribe.\n\n###
    Circles\n\nA circle can crudely be thought of as a hybrid of an adoptive clan
    and a workers\u2019 guild. It is important to note that a member of a circle still
    remains a member of her familial clan but will usually join a circle to engage
    in a particular line of work or carry out some specific project. Each circle is
    a form of tribal syndicate brought together for various specific purposes. Some
    circles have a long-term, permanent existence; others are more temporary and operate
    in the short or medium term. In the Thukker tribe, the Great Caravans are, broadly
    speaking, equivalent to the familial clans of the Minmatar tribes, while the smaller,
    usually specialized caravans and subcaravans are analogous to the circles.\n\nThe
    relationships between familial clans and circles are a tremendously complex social
    area. Practices differ from circle to circle, but when an individual joins a circle,
    there is usually some kind of buy-in\u2014a common analogy is to a wedding dowry\u2014whereby
    the new member brings a certain amount of resources to the circle\u2019s common
    treasury. This can affect the complex area of reputation, both the individual\u2019s
    and their familial clan\u2019s, with regard to the circle. Many circles are quite
    naturally internal to a given tribe, but inevitably\u2014particularly during the
    Amarr occupation and later in the republic period\u2014 some cross-tribe circles
    came into being. Almost all circles cross family and clan lines, on the other
    hand, one of the original purposes of circles being to share knowledge within
    the tribe.\n\nCircles were occasionally a source of controversy in the early Minmatar
    Republic, with accusations that some circles were secret societies wielding enormous
    power or, perhaps more likely, little more than organized crime groups. The Minmatar
    military, while formally organized in a typical military hierarchy, is also known
    to be crisscrossed by various circles, only adding to the complexities of running
    armed forces where clan and tribal ties play a significant role. Additionally,
    numerous Minmatar corporations were founded and continue to be run by the largest
    circles. The web of relationships and reputation surrounding these often quite
    powerful groupings is simply beyond the understanding of any outsider, given how
    much of it is informal and mediated by convention. \nReligion\n\n### The First
    Elders\n\nFrom the time of their first empire, the Minmatar traditionally followed
    a set of religious philosophies that varied by tribe, but shared the same pantheon
    of seven spirits. The spirits are known as the \u201CFirst Elders\u201D and are
    considered individually to be tutelary spirits of each of the seven tribes of
    Matar. In Minmatar philosophy, each spirit is seen as embodying a particular aspect
    of the human condition. Interpretations of these aspects vary from tribe to tribe,
    and it is perhaps no surprise that each tribe has a pronounced tendency to regard
    its own tutelary First Elder in the most positive light. Attitudes to the tutelaries
    of other tribes vary but are in the main reverent. Even the Krusual give a grudging
    acknowledgement of the importance of the Nefantar First Elder, though they are
    inclined to present that spirit in such terms as a tragic chief overcome with
    grief at the betrayal of his sons. This may very well not be the traditional view
    of that spirit, but the Krusual claim otherwise.\n\nWhat is notable about the
    traditional religious philosophy of the Minmatar is that the First Elders are
    not simply traditional spirits worshiped or contemplated according to ancient
    practice. As the First Elders are the mythological incarnations of the seven Minmatar
    tribes, the traditional practice has been for each tribe to select a man or woman
    from every generation dating back to antiquity and name her as that tribe\u2019s
    elder. These living elders were charged with the responsibility of absorbing the
    accumulated knowledge of the Minmatar tribes and using it to guide the nation
    toward the future. Although human, the elders were and are treated with a form
    of reverence so extreme that its parallel doesn\u2019t exist anywhere else in
    Minmatar society.\n\nUpon an elder\u2019s death, she is said to merge with the
    archetypal First Elder spirit of her tribe. Her name will be recorded for posterity,
    but for philosophical purposes she is always considered first and foremost a torchbearer
    for the deeply fundamental human trait the tribe\u2019s First Elder is taken to
    embody. The members of each tribe are well versed from a young age in the teachings
    of their First Elder, from which their philosophies and outlook on life broadly
    derive. Since the Minmatar are a highly individualistic people, the interpretation
    and application of elder teachings varies greatly, but it has been noted time
    and time again how remarkably pronounced these traits are for each respective
    tribe.\n\nIt has often been said that the corresponding tribal division along
    spiritual lines is a major reason why the Minmatar nation has had such historical
    trouble uniting its people. That the Minmatar people were able to unite in a global
    civilization centuries before the Amarr invasion of their worlds is for many evidence
    that any notion that their spirituality necessarily divides them is false. If
    you ask the Minmatar they are likely to tell you that the bond they feel for their
    tribe is no barrier to community within the larger nation; instead, they lay the
    blame squarely at the feet of the Amarr.\n\n### The Amarr Faith\n\nCertainly the
    Amarr have had a strong influence on the Minmatar, and not just through simple
    slavery and subjugation. Many are the Minmatar slaves who have been indoctrinated
    into the Amarr religion or even adopted it willingly. The surviving Starkmanir
    and defector Nefantar have among them many who continue to follow the Amarr faith
    despite their escape from the empire. To the dismay, and in many cases anger,
    of many Minmatar there are many who refuse to put aside their beliefs even when
    told of all that the Amarr Empire has done to the Matari people. The presence
    of Minmatar adherents of the Amarr religion is a major source of social tension
    within the Minmatar Republic.\n\nAdditionally, over the period of their enslavement,
    some Minmatar living as slaves on Amarr worlds have taken the faith of their oppressors
    and morphed it with the tribal mysticism of ages past to create a hybrid religion.
    It is a pantheistic version of the Amarr faith, heavily focused on communal meditation,
    as well as ritual sacrifice. For the Amarr this kind of perversion of the faith
    is far too close to the Sani Sabik heresy for their liking. In the centuries since
    the Minmatar were first enslaved, practice of this hybrid religion within Amarr
    territories has ranged from being cause for disciplinary purification to a capital
    offense.\n\nIn recent times, all across the empire\u2014first under the relatively
    liberal reigns of Heideran VII and Doriam II, and then under the lax religious
    policies of Chamberlain Karsoth, who was himself perhaps the greatest Amarr heretic
    of recent times\u2014some Amarr have been adopting elements of this hybrid religion.
    Furthermore, many of the vast numbers of freed Minmatar who have returned home
    to the republic since the Elder War have brought the pantheistic heresy back to
    their tribes alongside the orthodox Amarr faith.\n\n### Minmatar Tattoos\n\n####
    Tattoo Culture\n\nWhen the Minmatar Empire was at its height, before a single
    Amarr ship ever darkened its skies, the Minmatar had truly made the tattoo into
    a form of high art. It was said the best artists could breathe life into the skin
    of an individual with their work. Today\u2019s works, although still beyond what
    other races can achieve, are mere scribbling compared to the greatness of their
    predecessors. The Minmatar tattoo artists of today are forever seeking to regain
    the knowledge and skill that was lost to them when the Amarr issued an edict banning
    the practice.\n\nThis ban was a savage blow to the Minmatar, for a Minmatar\u2019s
    tattoos proclaim who he is, where he comes from, what he does, where he has been,
    and what he has experienced. They represent a Minmatar\u2019s identity, as well
    as his story. During the occupation, the Amarr all but eradicated the tattoo culture.
    Nevertheless, it managed to survive in an inevitably degraded form until the Great
    Rebellion. In the long, hard struggle for the Minmatar to regain all that was
    lost to them, the culture of tattoos was given primacy. The Minmatar Republic
    of today is enjoying a renewed ascendancy of this ancient art form, with the tattoo
    once again representing an integral part of Minmatar culture and being.\n\nWhile
    the forms and styles of tattoo vary across tribes, the structure and culture behind
    the art are surprisingly uniform, making it a strong source of unity between the
    tribes. A notable exception to this is found in the Thukker tribe, where tattoo
    culture is not observed with anything like the universal adoption it has among
    the republic tribes. While many Thukker wear tattoos and even take part in the
    Voluval ceremony, it is not considered a detriment within Thukker society to go
    without tattoos or a Voluval mark. While this is considered to be one of the more
    unfortunate aspects of Thukker culture by the other tribes, it is accepted, given
    the power of the Thukker. The tattoo culture is also only sporadically observed
    within the recently returned Starkmanir and Nefantar tribes, though there are
    great social pressures on members of those tribes to adopt it.\n\n#### The Voluval\n\nThe
    Voluval is the sacred coming-of-age ceremony for the Minmatar. It is here that
    the individual transforms from a child into a fully recognized member of his tribe.
    At the height of the ceremony, the presiding shaman will finalize the ritual by
    invoking the Voluval mark, where the soul and destiny of a person are said to
    be revealed through the emergence of a tattoo, the secrets of which are closely
    guarded by the Vherokior mystics who kept it alive during the long centuries of
    subjugation. The Voluval is considered the most sacred mark a Minmatar can carry,
    and in some rare cases can change his life irrevocably. Although the significance
    attached to the Voluval mark has waned considerably in today\u2019s republic,
    certain marks can still see the recipient cast out from his clan and tribe, and
    conversely certain marks can lend the bearer much acclaim. In nearly all cases,
    the mark falls somewhere between these two extremes, and the bearer moves on with
    little effect.\n\nA Minmatar cannot bestow upon herself any tattoo, and no Minmatar
    tattoo is without social significance. Usually she may be able to influence styling
    and shape, but she cannot add a specific tattoo without having first earned the
    right. Inking a tattoo upon yourself without permission is considered a grave
    crime and offenders are subject to severe judicial punishment. Because of this
    arrangement, a Minmatar who is heavily tattooed is more respected by her peers,
    which will allow her greater opportunities to advance. Her experience is there
    for all to see."

- body: "## Growing Up Minmatar\n\nWhile it is true for most people that the circumstances
    of one\u2019s birth profoundly affect one\u2019s future, it is for the Minmatar
    a matter of critical importance. Fully a third of the Matari people remain enslaved
    by the Amarr Empire. To be born to slavery means at best indoctrination by the
    Amarr in their religion, a life of unpaid toil, and possibly freedom in later
    life, if it suits the purposes of the Amarr. At worst it can mean being worked
    to death in the fields of a remote plantation or the depths of an asteroid mine.
    Nothing of the rich heritage and culture of the Minmatar will be taught to slaves
    by their masters, and any sharing of such fragments of knowledge that slave communities
    have preserved will be punished severely by the Amarr if discovered.\n\nFor those
    born as slaves but later freed and returned to the republic, unlearning Amarr
    indoctrination is a process that will take and shape the rest of their lives;
    often, they will never learn fully what it is to be a free Minmatar. Rescued or
    repatriated Minmatar are assisted by their tribes as a matter of course, but the
    powerful indoctrination of the Amarr faith is commonly found to be unshakable.
    Many free Minmatar choose to continue following the Amarr religion and bring up
    their children in that faith. Such choices are incomprehensible to the Minmatar
    who inherited the legacy of the Great Rebellion, and it is usual and wise for
    Minmatar adherents of the Amarr religion to practice their faith in private.\n\nMany
    other Minmatar are brought up in the cosmopolitan world of the Gallente Federation,
    where perhaps a fifth of the total Matari population of New Eden have chosen to
    make their home. While many of these Minmatar celebrate and observe their tribal
    affiliations as a matter of cultural heritage, it is not usual for them to follow
    the implications of tribal culture to their logical conclusion. The Minmatar of
    the federation, indeed, are more loyal to the ideals of the Gallente democracy
    than the tribal politics of the Minmatar Republic. Even so, as a relatively recent
    and immigrant addition to the Gallente Federation, the Minmatar who live and grow
    up there are often confronted with their share of prejudice.\n\nEven in the case
    of birth in the Minmatar Republic or aboard the caravans of the Thukker tribe,
    discovering one\u2019s place among the Minmatar is a path and not a destination.
    The son of a clan chief may have certain advantages over other children, but only
    for so long as he can justify and earn them. Rites of passage, contests, and other
    traditional rituals help young Minmatar discover what is best for them and their
    people. Failing or succeeding in these tests determines a Minmatar\u2019s initial
    place in the community. These challenges are not only physical, but mental and
    social. As the Minmatar grow and develop, they continue to devise tests for themselves.
    Many young Minmatar join a circle, a group of like-minded Minmatar that have joined
    together in pursuit of a specific goal or to work on a given project. Membership
    in a circle is not necessarily for life\u2014or determined by ties of family,
    clan, and tribe\u2014and it is usual for young Minmatar to leave their first circle
    and go on to other things. Progression, advancement, and self-reliance are key
    concepts in the Minmatar mindset.\n\nBy the time a Minmatar reaches adolescence,
    she will have a good idea of where her natural talents lie, and so will her family,
    clan, and tribe at large. At adolescence, Minmatar undergo the Voluval, a coming-of-age
    ceremony common across all clans and tribes. The Voluval ends with the youth receiving
    a special form of tattoo marking her emergence into adulthood, along with all
    her responsibility toward family, clan, and tribe. Afterward, the newly recognized
    adult usually begins serious study and practice in those areas where she shows
    promise. The exact form of this study varies greatly. Some Minmatar are apprenticed
    to a lone tradesman, while others join circles dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge.
    Many simply enroll in academies with thousands of similarly talented youths. Upon
    completing her education, a Minmatar enters society fully, with all the choices
    and responsibilities that entails."

- body: "## Notable Characters\n\n### Maleatu Shakor\n\nSanmatar Maleatu Shakor is
    the current leader of the Minmatar Republic, occupying a unique role in Matari
    society as a mediator and spokesperson for the Minmatar tribes. As chair of the
    Tribal Council, Maleatu Shakor acts on its behalf on the public stage and is seen
    by many as the republic\u2019s head of state, even though in law that role is
    collectively held by the entire Tribal Council. \n\nShakor\u2019s reputation outside
    the Minmatar Republic is as a militarist who favors confrontation above negotiation.
    In fact, despite his record as a commander of Minmatar fighters against the Amarr
    Empire, Shakor is known within the republic for his canny handling of tribal politics
    and his careful approach to rebuilding a society still coming to terms with the
    return of the Nefantar and Starkmanir tribes.\n\n### Karin Midular\n\nKarin Midular
    was the prime minister of the Minmatar Republic during the first years of the
    Empyrean Age and is viewed as pursuing a foreign policy of compromise and reconciliation,
    particularly with the Amarr Empire. This strategy is widely considered a failure
    tantamount to appeasement within Minmatar society, but Karin Midular remained
    the respected chief of the Sebiestor tribe up until her assassination in YC 115.
    \n\nThe powerful influence of Midular\u2019s role as a Ray of Matar\u2014a traditional
    status of leadership conferred on those bearing the Voluval mark of that name\u2014meant
    that she would continue to be held in high regard. Her assassination by a federation
    citizen, in a mass shooting at a Minmatar festival in the Gallente city of Caille,
    led to confrontation and deeply strained relations between the Minmatar Republic
    and the Gallente Federation.\n\n### Ana Utulf\n\nAs the first Nefantar governor
    of the Ammatar Mandate, Ana Utulf was in a unique position to act when the surviving
    members of the Starkmanir tribe were discovered on the Ammatar world of Halturzhan.
    A member of one of the Nefantar conspirator families that had long sheltered the
    remaining Starkmanir from the wrath of the Amarr, Utulf first obstructed the Amarr
    authorities and then, when the Elder Fleet invaded, openly defected and aided
    in the rescue of the Starkmanir. \n\nUtulf led the calls for the Nefantar to abandon
    the Mandate and return to the Minmatar Republic. The conspirator families and
    many others heeded that call, and a large portion of the Nefantar tribe subsequently
    traveled to the republic as refugees. While many believed Utulf would try for
    the Nefantar chiefdom in the republic, she evidently recognized the deep controversy
    that would generate and retired from public life.\n\n### Abel Jarek\n\nAbel Jarek
    was a charismatic cleric in the Salvation Church of Blessed Servitude, a movement
    of former slaves preaching the Amarr faith. He became well known as leader of
    the \"Salvation Crusade,\" an attempt to spread the word of the Amarr faith inside
    the Minmatar Republic. Jarek and 214 other former slaves began their efforts at
    converting Minmatar within the republic in early YC 111. \n\nMeeting with considerable
    opposition, not least due to the rather ill-chosen name of the \"Crusade\", they
    first worked in the refugee camps of Matar. Jarek later tried to establish a permanent
    religious community in Matar\u2019s Tronhadar valley region\u2014once again showing
    his lack of sensitivity, given the area\u2019s status as a stronghold of the Krusual
    tribe. He died in an attack on the Salvation township by masked vigilantes. His
    life and death highlighted the problems and tensions arising from the presence
    of increasingly large numbers of former slaves in the Minmatar Republic."
