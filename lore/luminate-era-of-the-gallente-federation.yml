- body: "The **Luminate Era of the Gallente Federation** (or the Early Federate Era)
    covers the time from the creation of the interstellar union in 23121AD to just
    before first contact with the Jin-Mei in 23168AD. It is noted by the initial tensions
    within the [Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK), the secession of the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy)
    and the outbreak of the [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV), and the
    subsequent reforms in response. Though the Luminate Era lasted less than a century,
    its landmark events would shape the history of the Gallente and Caldari civilizations
    for the future.\n\n### Birth of the Federation\n#### The Founding\nThe Federated
    Union of Gallente Prime, or simply the Federation, was founded in 1702AR (23121AD),
    signed by all nations of the Gallente, Caldari, [Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn)
    and [Mannar](4BaMCkOwYaPpd4ZMtEfEY) homeworlds, and several other entities. It
    replaced all the previous interstellar organizations that came prior, uniting
    all of humanity and known space under a treaty known as the Federal Charter. The
    treaty outlined the rights of each member state, as well as the powers and limitations
    of the Federation as a central body. The founding of the Federation took place
    in the city of [Caille](73TXaac6RTgSJaqJHkTxCz) on the Gallente homeworld, which
    became the union's ''de facto'' capital.\n\nOfficially, the primacy of [Gallente
    Prime](41JbD6M3Keq024T44ULv7a) in the union\u2019s founding was deemed symbolic
    of the fact that it was widely considered the first cosmopolitan planet in known
    space, and an undeniable \u2018center of civilization\u2019. This was on top of
    the idea that the term \u2018Gallente\u2019 was fluid in its definition, with
    no cultural restrictions as to who may identify as such. To many others, Gallente
    Prime was chosen as the homeworld simply because it had been the most dominant
    player since the start of space exploration. Of note, this was the first official
    use of the name \u2018Gallente Prime\u2019, over the more traditional Gallentia.
    The new Federal Calendar was introduced; the year was dated as FC1.\n\nThe first
    Federation authority was composed of a [Senate](x8brOPuT22Bcly2Sikkt5) overlooking
    a variety of smaller administrative bodies to regulate and control interstellar
    affairs. The Senate was composed of representatives appointed to the position
    by the various subject nations. In turn, the Senate would vote amongst themselves
    to appoint a [President](UW2GqozmvYnsm1kRPpp1E). At the Federation\u2019s founding,
    there was no [Supreme Court](6gOOivEzFVq2cUAKDvKZEQ). International disputes were
    settled by a special Senate committee. Though Senators represented their home
    nations, they had no power within them. A [Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1) was also
    created, which acted primarily as a watchful peacekeeping armada, protecting independent
    space development from piracy or other threats.\n\nOne of the most important elements
    of this new Federation was considering itself as the sole representative of the
    human race, standing as a meeting place to discuss all matters of mankind. Indeed,
    there was no comparable body in known space that could equal it. Unlike the modern
    day Federation, it was not considered a nation. Instead, the Federation was envisioned
    as the ideal and final development of human civilization, transcending nations,
    races, or cultures. The Federation was designed to replace the concepts of dividing
    individuals based on artificial constructs such as ethnicity or world of birth.
    Its ultimate goal would be to unite humanity under a peaceful, post-nationalist
    and post-racialist flag where all could flourish at an individual level. However,
    as communications technology was not as advanced as it would become, these ideals
    were seldom exported outside of Luminaire. For now, it would remain the primary
    arbitrator of interstellar exploration and trade.\n\nWhile the founding of the
    Federation successfully and democratically united most of known space over the
    following years (with the Verge states joining when they found themselves encircled),
    criticism was levied against this union early on. One of the core requirements
    of membership of the Federation was to be a democratic state with universal suffrage.
    This was not a problem for mostly all the members except for the Caldari, who
    had still not fully embraced democracy despite the centuries of attempts to encourage
    it upon them. Nonetheless, as founding members of the Federation, the Caldari
    were faced with no choice; all nations on their homeworld switched to a democratic
    system. This was viewed by many Caldari as yet another abuse of their people and
    culture by the Gallente. Though little issue was made of it initially, it was
    clear that this Caldari faction was being pushed close to the edge.\n\nAnother
    problem with the initial Federation was the dominance of Gallente representatives
    in the Senate, due to their superior population and national membership. This
    meant that laws could be passed in favor of the Gallente, with other races not
    hoping to outvote them by numbers alone. In addition, many smaller states were
    disaffected, as the Charter specifically identified the Gallente, Caldari, Intaki
    and Mannar states as the major signatories. Those without a large enough population
    (certain homeworlds included) were classed as minor members, and thus could not
    wield as much influence.\n\n#### Every Shore Endeavor\nAs a newly unified entity,
    the Federation\u2019s first major endeavor was to colonize the area of space that
    bordered the Gallente and Mannar home systems, after having successfully overseen
    the full settlement of the region around Luminaire (which later became known as
    Essence). With a centralized organization and bureaucracy, this could be done
    with far greater ease than ever before. The Federation acted as a facilitator
    for all parties in colonization, whether these parties be individuals or corporations.
    \n\nFor the colonization of the region, the Federation Navy was charged with most
    security and defense concerns. Colonists of all backgrounds and ethnicities migrated
    to the region, which is where it acquired its modern name of [Everyshore](239UsWf0eflceZoW5SLYvE).
    Mannar states were aggressive in quickly expanding and laying claim to areas of
    their own, disgruntled by the claiming of systems they felt they were entitled
    to from the beginning. Several clashes emerged and had to be arbitrated by the
    Federation when Mannar colonists settled on worlds already claimed by others.\n\nIt
    was clear communication was becoming a problem, where delays ranging from hours
    to days meant that the Federation was too slow to respond to colonial flashpoints.
    The asteroid belts in Everyshore were found to hold significant amounts of minerals,
    which were mined with a vigor never before seen to fuel the construction projects
    that the quickly expanding borders required. It was not long before greedy eyes
    turned towards the planets when it became clear that large-scale asteroid mining
    operations became uneconomical. \n\nIn the system of Aclan, the Astral Mining
    corporation, filling a contract for the Federation Navy, introduced a herbicide
    into the atmosphere of a lush planet to clear its vast jungle and enable mining
    to begin. Because of the limitations of communications technology, it took a whole
    week for central Federal authorities to become aware of what had occurred.\n\nOutraged
    at the senseless destruction, where many species of flora and fauna were lost
    that had not even been studied, prominent ecologists managed to force a bill through
    the Federal Senate; no planet that supported any life-form was to have its ecosystem
    tampered with in any way without a license being granted from the Federation.
    This law, the only one of its kind amongst the modern four empires, became known
    as [the Aclan Agreement](239UsWf0eflceZoW5SLYvE) and it remains in place to this
    day. However, the problem with communications remained, and it was clear that
    the new law would be nothing but an empty gesture unless there was a surefire
    method to enforce it.\n\nThe answer came in FC25 (23146AD) with the discovery
    of [Faster Than Light Communication](7Eqc0yOgUoUswOop0Q2uMQ) from young Gallente
    scientist Li Azbel. Since the discovery of the Sotiyo-Urbaata warp drive, the
    Gallente and Caldari nations had promised huge rewards for the discovery of a
    FTL communications method, which was previously deemed impossible due to the nature
    of the starship FTL drive. The famous Azbel-Wuthrich experiment demonstrated that
    FTL communications were indeed possible. Within the year, the Federation had begun
    erecting FTL relays across colonized space, from lunar satellites to communication
    towers on remote planetary continents. Thanks to instantaneous communications,
    space was smaller than ever before, and enabled easier colonization and expansion.\n\n####
    Democracy goes Faster-than-Light\nOn top of an increased ease of space colonization,
    there were two additional consequences of the establishment of a widespread FTL
    network. The first was enabling popular democracy to take part at the interstellar
    level. Following much pressure from popular Gallente and Intaki interests, the
    Charter was amended so that voting by universal suffrage would elect one-third
    of the members of the Federation Senate, rising to half within the following years.
    \n\nThis had the side-effect of giving the Gallente further penetration within
    the Senate. For example, Gallente living in the nations of other races were significantly
    more inclined than the natives to participate in these Federation-wide elections
    (with the exception of the Intaki). This meant that those nations who would otherwise
    appoint Senators with local interests at heart were suddenly represented by those
    more concerned in the greater Gallente ideology.\n\nThe second consequence of
    the invention of an FTL communications network was the formation of a Gallente-dominated
    interstellar media, which ultimately led to the creation of a constitution. Gallente
    Prime was the first planet to create a global media network, and thus it pioneered
    the exporting of these concepts to the interstellar level. The various member
    cultures of the Federation would eventually be warped slightly to abide by a libertarian
    standard, beyond just their governments being democratic. Gallente and Intaki
    citizens would learn of the plights of individuals on other worlds, ranging from
    local government censorship to [slavery](slavery) and corporate exploitation.\n\nThe
    Gallente concept of \u2018human rights\u2019 and ensuring that all members of
    the Federation abode by it suddenly became an interstellar issue. However, the
    Federation had no legal basis to intervene in domestic affairs, with Intaki and
    Caldari Senators being at the forefront of enforcing restraint. The Gallente nations,
    however, would bypass the Federation and sanction, penalize, or otherwise threaten
    \u2018unsavory\u2019 states directly.\n\nResponding to large public pressure,
    Senators from mostly Gallente and some Intaki nations quickly pushed through the
    idea of a Federal Constitution and corresponding amendments to the Federal Charter
    that would not only recognize such a document as binding, but require the member
    governments to abide by the constitution\u2019s principles. The Constitution outlined
    individual rights for every single citizen within the Federation, protecting them
    from government heavy-handedness with a plethora of rights, ranging from freedom
    of expression to freedom of preference. \n\nOf note, the new Federal Constitution
    used the term \u201CFederation citizen\u201D for the first time. Beforehand, all
    government documents would refer to citizens of the individual member states instead.
    This was popularly considered as the Federation\u2019s first step to the concept
    of full nationhood, rather than just being an interstellar authority, much to
    the chagrin of the Caldari nations and even some Gallente states. The Federation\u2019s
    newly-found power to intervene in planetary and sub-planetary affairs was a notable
    contribution to the tensions that characterized the early Federation.\n\n####
    Jove Conspiracies\nThe Jove Empire made themselves known to the Federation in
    FC28 (23149AD). The two empires engaged in limited diplomacy, though the Jove
    warned that they would cut off contact if the Federal government revealed their
    existence to the public. In return for some sparse details about the internal
    workings of the Jove, the Federation permitted them transport within their borders.
    Newly-appointed President Arlette Villers was all too happy to comply with this
    unofficial agreement, wary that the revelation of the Jove to the Federal public
    may have a destabilizing consequence. \n\nThe advanced ship technology of the
    Jove meant there were almost never discovered by the public nor Navy, but there
    were some sightings by civilians and independent astronomers. This spawned an
    array of conspiracy theories regarding interstellar aliens and the like, though
    all claims were denied by the Federal government.\n\n### Early Civil War Period\n####
    Sobaseki's Sedition\nTensions hit fever pitch between the Caldari states and the
    Federation in FC33 (23154AD). By this point, the Caldari megacorporations had
    become immensely influential on the [Caldari homeworld](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i)
    and other territories within the Federation, thanks to the wealth and power they
    had generated by their secret colonies. It was often the case that CEOs would
    be seen to speak with more authority on Caldari matters than state or colony leaders
    would (who were no more than corporate puppets), something certain Gallente were
    wary about, but nothing that Federation law had any sort of mechanisms against.
    \n\nIn a national address to the New Oryioni Collective on the Caldari homeworld,
    [Kaalakiota](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK) CEO Matias Sobaseki inflamed tensions by accusing
    the Federation of subsuming the Caldari, and calling for all to take a stand to
    preserve their identity. In turn, Gallente Senators accused Sobaseki of sedition
    and encouraging insurrection, but current President Arlette Villers was not known
    for her confrontational nature. As an Intaki, she was averse to conflict, and
    did what was necessary to cool down tensions.\n\nSuch efforts were in vain, however,
    as an independent exploratory vessel stumbled across the hidden Caldari colonies
    later that year. The Federation Senate came to session and immediately began debating
    how to deal with this situation. According to Charter law, it was perfectly legal
    for colonies to be established independently, as had been done for centuries.
    However, questions emerged from the fact that these colonies were being administered
    by Federation-based corporations without any democratically-elected authorities.
    Gallente Senators demanded that the corporations relinquish control of the colonies,
    and hold elections for a new leadership based on universal suffrage.\n\nThe Caldari
    Senators, however, refused to bow down to the pressure of what they saw as yet
    another Gallente demand. They stated that the corporations, and not any democratic
    government, were now the primary representatives of the will of the Caldari people
    (though whether or not this was an actual reality remains debated to this day).
    Intaki Senators, encouraging restraint and wishing to defuse the situation, stated
    that the secret colonies were not technically Federation territory, and thus the
    laws of the Charter and Constitution did not apply. However, they did recognize
    the need to peacefully reel in the rogue territories into the Federation, believing
    that two separately administered areas of space would prove disharmonious in the
    long-term.\n\nThe Federal Senate was in danger of hitting deadlock, but it took
    no time at all for the corporate elites in Gallente society to intervene. They
    feared that even if the Caldari colonies were reeled into the Federation peacefully,
    the power and wealth of their corporations would be a threat to the influence
    of their own interests. \n\nTo these elites, the sovereignty of those territories
    must be uncompromisingly placed in the hands of the people, which would result
    in the Caldari corporations losing their huge industrial base, and thus ensure
    the hegemony of the Gallente corporations. Indeed, if those territories remained
    under Caldari corporate control in some form or another while being integrated
    into the Federation, these corporations would have the industrial base to supersede
    their Gallente counterparts as the primary economic player in space. This was
    seen as intolerable by these forces.\n\n#### Rise of the Ultra-Nationalists\nThe
    elites noted the growing, but still marginal, influence of the Guardians of Gallentia
    (better known as the Ultra-Nationalists, or U-Nats for short), a political party
    in the Senate who had originated from conservative nation-states on Gallentia
    and isolationist colonies. These conservative nations found the mass immigration
    to the homeworld that had taken place to be an abomination, as much of their ancient
    cultures and traditions had been lost due to the sociocultural effects of cosmopolitanism.
    Though the smallest of the spacebound political parties, they nonetheless represented
    a diverse range of political opinions. \n\nSome U-Nats felt that the Federation
    should never have been formed, and that the other races should never have been
    uplifted, left to fend for themselves. Others felt that, in order to best protect
    the cultures and identities of the Gallente homeworld, the Federation and all
    its precursor organizations should simply have uncompromisingly converted all
    foreign races to Gallente culture. To the Ultra-Nationalists, the culturally and
    politically sensitive politics that had taken place hundreds of years prior had
    come at the cost of several minor states amongst the Gallente. They resented the
    larger states who were the historical champions of the Federation, much in the
    same way certain Caldari resented the Gallente, though the U-Nats nonetheless
    implicated the former and other foreign races as another part of the problem.\n\nSeveral
    Gallente corporations poured countless millions into backing the Ultra-Nationalists
    within the Federal Senate. Their influence and popularity grew within days, with
    Mannar Senators aligning themselves with their Gallente counterparts. It didn\u2019t
    take long for the majority opinion in the Senate to demand that the once-hidden
    Caldari colonies be classed as Federation territory, which included the relinquishment
    of corporate sovereignty and the immediate establishment of democratic authorities.
    Voices within the Senate that said otherwise were simply drowned out by the Ultra-Nationalists,
    led by the charismatic Senator Luc Duvailer. President Arlette Villers was now
    rapidly becoming a puppet of the Senate despite her attempts to the contrary.\n\n####
    The Two Month Crisis\n##### Caldari Secession\nThe response of the Caldari corporations
    to the Senate demands came in the form of the Proclamation of Secession in November
    FC33 (23154AD) a day after the Senate\u2019s demand, with mostly all Caldari representatives
    walking out of the chamber following the declaration. The [Chief Executive Panel](5CmaMqj1ZsFw2j4C12JpmV),
    the governing body of the Caldari megacorporations within the secret colonies,
    usurped immediate control of the homeworld. Authority of the Caldari Army was
    turned over to them by compliant planetary leaders, expelling or imprisoning all
    openly Gallente-sympathetic soldiers. Using the Army, the CEP was able to assert
    itself over the few states that refused to go ahead with the proclamation, violently
    or otherwise.\n\nThe CEP declared the founding of the Caldari State, which included
    the homeworld (defiantly called Caldari Prime) and the once-hidden colonies. While
    this new State technically included the other Caldari territories within the Federation,
    the lack of any military presence in those areas meant the proclamation was not
    enforceable there. The newly-formed [Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN), composed
    of mostly single-man fighters and hastily-assembled carriers from industrial ships,
    moved to secure the stargates to their colonies (which also contained the bulk
    of their military infrastructure). \n\nThe Senate demanded that President Villers
    move to act at once, to treat this secession as an open rebellion. In response,
    the Federation Navy established a blockade of Caldari Prime. The economies of
    various worlds (including Caldari Prime) had been influenced over the recent decades
    to rely on off-world trade, and it was hoped that a planetary economic collapse
    may be enough to convince the Caldari to talk.\n\nDespite the sway of the Ultra-Nationalists,
    restraint within the Senate found its voice once again, championed by Intaki representatives.
    Combined with the Caldari\u2019s reluctance to actually wage open war against
    the more powerful Federation, nothing much happened for the next few days. Even
    with warships in orbit, the Federation was hesitant to take further action out
    of concern for both the Caldari civilians and the considerable Gallente community
    who resided on the planet. The Federal government began to debate amongst themselves
    how to best negotiate a peace agreement or otherwise put a handle on the situation.\n\nThere
    was no cohesive strategy. On one side, it was believed that the situation must
    be accepted, citing centuries worth of irreconcilable differences. The blockade
    of Caldari Prime should be lifted, and the two nations should go on their separate
    ways. However, the presence of a planet owned by a foreign nation within their
    capital system made the elements of the Gallente leadership very nervous. Many
    felt that Caldari Prime should be conquered militarily, and the situation should
    be left at that. However, the CEP were not open to negotiations, and thus a non-hostile
    reaction from the Caldari State in response to conquering their homeworld was
    not guaranteed.\n\nFor this reason, the Ultra-Nationalists felt that it would
    not be enough to guarantee the security of Luminaire by words alone, and that
    a full-on military campaign against the Caldari would be necessary. In support
    of war, the Mannar saw the Caldari as overly prideful and stubborn rebels, incapable
    of seeing the greater good that their culture has long stood for. However, all
    sides were equally vocal, and thus the Senate was overall indecisive in how to
    proceed. \n\n##### Kassigainen Standoff\nEventually, the Caldari on Caldari Prime
    became restless, finding the blockade intolerable. Beginning in December, small-scale
    guerrilla activities were carried out by particularly nationalistic Caldari against
    the native Gallente, many of whom had been living there for generations, and even
    had some Caldari blood themselves. In major cities, Gallente residents were victim
    to all manner of sectarian violence, while predominantly Gallente towns and villages
    found themselves at the brunt of the worst abuse. For centuries before, the distinction
    between both ethnicities on the Caldari homeworld was seldom an issue amongst
    the general public. Off-worlders found themselves absorbed into the local planetary
    culture, as the harsh environment necessitated adapting to the Caldari way of
    life there. Only the sudden government tensions occurring in space would bring
    the racial lines to the political foreground.\n\nIn response to the violence,
    disenfranchised Gallente members of the Caldari Army banded together to form the
    rebelliously-titled Free Caldari Army, to defend the local Gallente from their
    hostile neighbors. The situation escalated into all-out hostilities, with atrocities
    being committed by both sides. Entire towns and villages inhabited by the Gallente
    were leveled by the Caldari Army, while Gallente guerrillas made gruesome examples
    of captured Caldari soldiers. The speed at which the situation deteriorated, all
    in the space of less than a month, was alarming to both the Federation and the
    Caldari State. There were thousands of casualties, particularly those of Gallente
    ethnicity.\n\nThe Federation was quick to condemn the violence, all of which was
    doing nothing but polarizing the issue further, both to the public and Senate.
    On one side, the Ultra-Nationalists and their allies still believed that a full-scale
    military campaign against the Caldari must be undertaken, in order to protect
    the Gallente minority on Caldari Prime, who had begun fleeing to the seven underwater
    cities on the planet. On the other side, advocates of a diplomatic solution blamed
    the militarization of the situation as the reason the violence on Caldari Prime
    had erupted to begin with. If peaceful negotiations could take place, then the
    clashes could easily be quelled. \n\nPresident Arlette Villers once again found
    herself caught in between the two sides, but the severe complexities of the issue
    kept her from acting decisively. It was so early on in the Federation\u2019s existence
    that many of the first Presidents simply did not have enough experience in running
    an interstellar empire to know how to deal with these sorts of crises, especially
    one so severe that it risked fragmenting the union after only three decades of
    being.\n\nIn January FC34 (23155AD), action finally came in response as a result
    of the worst atrocity of the early sectarian clashes. Overnight, Caldari partisans
    known as the Templis Dragonaurs infiltrated the Gallente [underwater city](iPOJ3rI5MCUlvDiZDb65V)
    of [Nouvelle Rouvenor](7aF13uW1tkTLI8stM52xK) on Caldari Prime. They were able
    to sneak past the military defenses and sabotage the polyglas dome and containment
    fields using high-grade explosives they had stolen from the Caldari Army. From
    the crushing depressurization, over half a million died almost instantly, including
    the perpetrators themselves. The victims were primarily of Gallente ethnicity,
    including refugees that had fled to the city to flee the fighting on the surface.
    There were no survivors.\n\n##### New Year Coup\nThough the Chief Executive Panel
    denounced the Nouvelle Rouvenor attack, it did little to quell the events that
    followed. Federation or Caldari alike, the reactions of citizens ranged from appalled
    to traumatized. Up until that point, there had been no singular disaster in known
    history that had taken so many lives so quickly. The strongest feelings of anguish
    came from within Luminaire itself, and those furthest out from ground zero felt
    that only the worst could come from what had occurred. The Caldari were particularly
    fearful of the Federation\u2019s response to the attack, knowing that their vengeance
    would be a strong one.\n\nPresident Arlette Villers resigned the following morning,
    taking responsibility in stating that her indecision had ultimately allowed the
    Nouvelle Rouvenor disaster to occur. The turmoil in the Federation over the next
    twenty-four hours was unprecedented. Violence against Caldari citizens on Gallente
    Prime, Mannar and other areas escalated tenfold. Many states were forced to declare
    martial law, with protests calling for war erupting into rioting in response to
    the counter-protests that called for calculated restraint. \n\nSeveral nations
    on the Gallente homeworld and in associated territories threatened outright secession
    and denouncement of the Federation if a response to the attack did not come within
    the next forty-eight hours. To the opportunists amongst the corporate elite and
    military-industrial complex, the prospect of war would prove immensely profitable.
    All played a role in influencing the Federation\u2019s response to the Nouvelle
    Rouvenor attack and the atrocities that had occurred prior.\n\nThe Senate voted
    to temporarily suspend the Constitution and Charter, the only time in Federation
    history. The loudest, but far from the only, voice stated that a swift response
    must not be hampered by indecisiveness that had dominated the Federal government
    prior. The Ultra-Nationalists were able to seize control of the situation, having
    the public support of state leaders and massive corporate backing. After hours
    of venomous debate, the Senate finally decided to appoint U-Nat chairman, Luc
    Duvailer, as the new President. Many felt this was an affront to democracy, considering
    the Federation had blindly transitioned between chief executives in less than
    twenty-four hours without deeper rationale, but very few dared to speak up. As
    the Ultra-Nationalists consolidated control of the Federation, an authoritarian
    regime was unquestionably established.\n\nThe first action of President Duvailer
    was the declaration of martial law across the Federation on the same day of his
    appointment, during his inauguration speech. The leaders and citizenry who had
    called for decisive action from the central government suddenly found themselves
    with more than they had bargained for. At first, the declaration was considered
    bizarre. As an interstellar union of planets with no consistency in political
    systems, it was believed that the term \u2018martial law\u2019 simply could not
    apply, reserved for sub-planetary authorities instead. \n\nHowever, the sudden
    deployment of Federation troops on multiple worlds quickly answered such confusions.
    Rioters and protesters were imprisoned without trial, or shot on sight in extreme
    cases. Curfews, and even entire blockades of particularly rebellious planets,
    were established. Order and compliance was enforced at gunpoint. Sub-Federal leaders
    were faced with no choice but to accept the authority of the Ultra-Nationalists,
    less they see their constituents punished. Within twenty-four hours, stability
    had been imposed on the Federation by the U-Nats.\n\n#### First Battle of Luminaire\n#####
    Operation Heaven's Justice\nTwo days after President Duvailer\u2019s appointment,
    the Federation Navy was ordered to commence a strategic orbital bombardment of
    Caldari Prime for a period of a whole day. The objective was to inflict such a
    loss on the Caldari that they would surrender without question. Hundreds of thousands
    of casualties were inflicted, indiscriminate of ethnicity (although many Gallente
    had fled to the underwater cities that were spared from the bombardment, long
    before the campaign had begun). The natives of Caldari Prime were driven to the
    countryside, many cities having been reduced to nothing.\n\nThe Federation public
    and sub-leaders found the actions atrocious and appalling, considering the bombardment
    a disproportionate response to Nouvelle Rouvenor. On Gallente Prime, which had
    a low Federal military presence, many minor nations announced their intentions
    to secede and denounce the Federation. However, such intentions were short-lived.
    The major planetary powers, along with the Federation itself, launched a quick
    and decisive campaign to subdue these states. Outlying territories beyond Luminaire,
    fearful of what was taking place on both the Gallente and Caldari homeworlds,
    remained silent. It became clear that those who spoke up would be branded cowards
    or, worse, traitors to the cause.\n\nAfter a whole day of orbital bombardment,
    the Federation demanded the unconditional surrender of the Caldari forces. Despite
    the massive loss of life and the unshakable dominance of the Federation, the Chief
    Executive Panel refused. In response, the Federation resumed their bombardment,
    while troops were sent in to assume control of the planet. The Caldari Army\u2019s
    superior knowledge of the local terrain meant that this campaign was drawn out
    considerably. \n\nEarly on, the Federation Navy found themselves wasting resources
    on bombarding locations that were believed to be hideouts of Caldari forces, pummeling
    empty tundra or deserted settlements after having been tricked by the enemy. The
    morale and spirit of the Caldari Army meant that they were able to lure Federal
    ground forces into ruined cities or forests only to find themselves surrounded
    by hostile forces. The Caldari assumed victory in these situations, believing
    that the hostile navy in orbit would not bombard their own soldiers. They assumed
    wrong, however, as both Gallente and Caldari soldiers were bombarded indiscriminately.\n\nA
    ground war was drawn out; though the Federation had numerically and logistically
    superior forces with orbital dominance, the Caldari had unrivaled knowledge of
    their world, as well as having their morale boosted considerably by the fact they
    were fighting for their homes and families. Federal ground forces, meanwhile,
    were hampered by a low morale caused by a disillusionment with what was occurring.
    Unlike the Navy in orbit, Federation Army and Marine forces saw the atrocities
    that were taking place first hand, from the cities that were destroyed by orbital
    bombardment, to the orders of driving Caldari fighters and civilians from their
    homes.\n\nThe fighting continued for almost a month. The Chief Executive Panel
    was far from being in full agreement as to what the correct course of action was.
    They knew that many in the Federation were not sympathetic to the actions of President
    Duvailer and his Ultra-Nationalists. At the same time, they did not find the actions
    forgivable or permissible, stating that atrocities were still being committed
    despite the Federation public\u2019s sentiment. They also knew that simply surrendering
    would put them in a far worse state than they had ever been under the Gallente\u2019s
    influence so far.\n\nOn the other hand, other Caldari CEOs felt that this was
    preferential to the mounting casualties the fighting had resulted in. If they
    did not surrender, they risked being exterminated wholesale, assuming the Gallente
    masses did not rebel against the Federation before then. Thus, the Caldari leadership
    was hampered from acting decisively through these continuing disagreements. Despite
    the disillusioned morale of Gallente troops, their sheer numbers meant that it
    would only be a matter of time before Caldari Prime would be firmly in the control
    of the Federation.\n\n##### The Caldari Breakout\nFederal victory on Caldari Prime
    seemed at hand until the Caldari\u2019s Morning of Reasoning, almost a month into
    the Gallente campaign. The heads of the most militant corporations on the Chief
    Executive Panel jointly ousted the remaining CEOs from the board through the [Tea
    Maker Ceremony](4hZCOgeIQ4zuF3Gx8eFeCY). Rather than remaining on the planet and
    attempting to fight the Federation off, the CEP command devised an evacuation
    plan, to take the Caldari populace off the planet and ship them to new homes within
    the once-secret colonies.\n\nThe extremist-governed Federation reviewed this intention
    curiously. Their objective was a swift and brutal conquest, but at the same time,
    if the Caldari evacuated their homeworld, an economic collapse within Luminaire
    once order had been restored would be inevitable. The sizable Gallente population
    on Caldari Prime would not be enough to fill in the sudden economic and industrial
    gap that would emerge. Given Gallente Prime\u2019s dependency on the Caldari homeworld,
    the Federation had to act to prevent a mass evacuation. They either turned the
    Caldari ships around, imprisoned the evacuees for later repatriation or, in extreme
    cases, destroyed the vessels. It was clear that the evacuation program would not
    work without a full month of Caldari orbital control, something they had yet to
    achieve.\n\nDuring this time, the sheer level of authoritarianism that had taken
    place within a short amount of time across the historically liberal and democratic
    Federation and precursor entities was beginning to show signs of straining. The
    Ultra-Nationalists had launched a pervasive propaganda campaign that attempted
    to justify their actions as protecting the Federation from destabilizing forces.
    Extended pieces of state-controlled media romanticized the pre-history of the
    Federation and the values it espoused, showing the nation to be the future of
    a united humanity that would take all of mankind into a new golden age, and that
    the Caldari and other dissidents were enemies of such principles. However, the
    style of such propaganda was slanted in its Gallente Prime origins. Luminaire
    natives were hardly buying the propaganda to begin with, and those outside the
    capital system were even less inclined to do so themselves.\n\nThe Ultra-Nationalist
    regime started to get paranoid of conspirators against them. The population was
    getting restless over the continued martial law and suspension of the Federal
    Charter and Constitution. The Federation military was forced to withdraw from
    occupied worlds and redeploy to Caldari Prime, meaning that the authoritarian
    grip on those planets was loosened. Anti-war protests began to erupt in locales
    where the Federation had withdrawn, or places that it had little presence to begin
    with, such as Intaki. Instability was looking to return as quickly as its gunpoint
    opposite had been established.\n\nPresident Duvailer and his ministers started
    firing prominent figures in the administration who started to show doubts, replacing
    them with eager yes-men with little experience and even less initiative. State
    and other sub-planetary leaders were stripped of their positions and replaced
    with puppets that had absolutely no connection or history with their constituents,
    making them ineffective executives that did nothing to quell anti-Federation sentiment.
    U-Nats attempted to counteract the large amount of defections or desertions within
    the military by replacing the senior leadership with freshly-promoted admirals,
    although this simply worsened the situation. On the Gallente homeworld, the legacy
    nation-states were becoming incensed at the loss of their Charter-guaranteed sovereignty,
    angered at the sight of Federation troops policing their ancient streets.\n\n####
    Intaki Protests\nOne particular flashpoint emerged on Intaki. The sympathy for
    the Caldari was strongest here, amongst other places. When the Federation was
    founded, the Intaki and Mannar governments dictated for a minimal central presence.
    Given the lack of FTL communications at the time and the physical distance of
    the two systems from Luminaire, this was easy to stipulate initially. However,
    when the Federation-wide FTL network was established, the bureaucracy had started
    to gain a reputation over the years for meddling in Intaki affairs, laying heavily
    upon them. \n\nWhen the Ultra-Nationalists consolidated power, they quelled a
    few minor uprisings on the Intaki homeworld, but once the regime\u2019s powerbase
    started to look shifty, matters started to spiral downwards again. Several movements
    emerged, ranging from anti-war or pro-secession, to even anti-Gallente. However,
    the leaders of Gallente Prime were watching the U-Nats carefully. If they responded
    to the Intaki situation harshly, they would have the vindication needed to attempt
    an uprising in the Senate. President Duvalier was aware of this, knowing that
    acting against the strong Gallente-Intaki relationship may spell his downfall.\n\nInstead,
    Duvalier ordered the immediate arrest and detention of some five thousand Intaki
    individuals who were deemed the biggest threat to the stability of the regime.
    The majority of these Intaki were from the homeworld, though many were from across
    the wider Federation. The Intaki Five Thousand (as they become known) ranged from
    rebel leaders to perpetrators of hate crimes against ethnic Gallente, but there
    were many peaceful activists amongst them as well. \n\nRather than imprisoning
    them in Ultra-Nationalist detention facilities (which had quickly become infamous
    for their draconian nature), or even executing them, the U-Nats ordered their
    immediate exile to the outskirts of the Federation. The exiles were barred from
    colonizing any planets or moons, and instead built themselves a collection of
    space stations that would later become the Intaki Syndicate. Conspirators against
    Duvailer begrudgingly found little disagreement with what was perceived as a reasonable
    action, especially considering the questionable backgrounds and activities of
    most of the exiles. As a result, the President\u2019s grip on power was maintained.\n\n####
    Second Battle of Luminaire\n##### Federation Retreat\nThe military command shake-up
    by the Ultra-Nationalists began to have a detriment on the Federal war effort.
    Soon enough, the Caldari fleet were able to gain control of the orbital zones
    of their homeworld with relative ease, sending the Federation Navy in a gradual
    retreat back to Gallente Prime. This tactical defeat at the hands of the Caldari
    shook support for the Ultra-Nationalists, with dissenting opinions ranging from
    their failure to pacify the situation, to others noting that violence possibly
    coming to another homeworld was a reason why the war was a poor idea to begin
    with. Indeed, the U-Nats were counting on the less moderate Caldari to launch
    a strike on Gallente Prime, in order to gain the justification and vindication
    they needed to commit to an all-out retaliation.\n\nBut the Caldari command knew
    that it would be impossible to decisively defeat the Luminaire fleet, and difficult
    to defend against once it had regrouped to reclaim the space around Caldari Prime.
    Instead, the evacuation program was hastened, and millions of Caldari were leaving
    the planet. The Ultra-Nationalists grew uneasy; the longer they held back, the
    greater the chance they would be left to conquering an empty planet. Even the
    few moderates left in the Federal government, such as choice Intaki Senators,
    knew that the economic collapse this would bring about in Luminaire would have
    far-reaching implications for the rest of the union. Faced with a premature end
    to the young Federation, all agreed this situation had to be rectified, but the
    U-Nat hegemony meant that it would be uncompromisingly corrected through violence.\n\nAfter
    two weeks, more than half of the Caldari population still remained on their homeworld.
    Federal ground forces, cut off from orbital support, were forced to retreat to
    the remaining Gallente underwater cities on Caldari Prime. The Federation Navy
    began planning a final offensive, with the objective to drive out all remaining
    Caldari space forces and land hundreds of thousands of soldiers onto the surface
    to prevent the evacuation and end the conflict once and for all. The Caldari leadership
    were aware of this, however, growing increasingly uneasy. Attacking the fleets
    amassing around Gallente Prime was seen as a suicidal act. Instead, one Caldari
    admiral took matter into his own hands.\n\n##### Operation Last Wind\nDefying
    Caldari command, Admiral [Yakiya Tovil-Toba](RsUoECrk1bkV0t35D4sDE) of the Caldari
    Navy assembled the few dozen ships under his command and warped to Gallente Prime
    orbit, catching the Federal forces completely off-guard. Several picket fleets
    were destroyed by the Caldari, while superficial strikes on orbital defense satellites
    sent the Federal naval command into a sudden panic, fearing this was a preliminary
    to a full-on Caldari counteroffensive against the Gallente homeworld. \n\nThe
    Federal admiralty, nothing but puppets for the U-Nats, decided that Admiral Tovil-Toba
    was the real threat, mistaking him to be the military executive over all Caldari
    forces. The paranoia that dominated the Federal regime at the time allowed this
    tactical mistake to take place, what would later be an unsound decision to focus
    all efforts against this admiral and his fleet. The Federation had abandoned Caldari
    Prime and off-handedly permitted the mass evacuations to take place.\n\nThe Federation
    Navy quickly reassembled and struck at Admiral Tovil-Toba during a Caldari siege
    of a civilian space station in orbit around Gallente Prime. The agile ships of
    the Caldari, which was mostly composed of single-man fighters, light cruisers
    and hastily-reassembled industrial ships, were able to prove troublesome towards
    the Federation vessels, which were slow multi-role vessels designed for ship-to-ship
    combat, planetary invasion and logistics all in one. The point defenses of the
    Federal warships meant that inflicting losses on the Caldari proved tricky, losing
    a handful of battleships and cruisers to these fighter craft.\n\n##### Floreau
    Skirmish\nAgility won out in these battles, and Admiral Tovil-Toba was able to
    fight off the advancing Federation forces and tactically withdraw at every encounter.
    Retreating to the moon of Floreau, Admiral Tovil-Toba started a systematic bombardment
    of the colonies there, hoping to draw the attention of the Federal fleet and lead
    them right into a trap. The Federation was delayed, however, having to regroup
    before they were able to strike once more at Tovil-Toba\u2019s forces. The next
    day, the two fleets clashed yet again, with Admiral Tovil-Toba proving his tactical
    command superiority in being able to inflict losses against the Federation forces,
    and then withdraw relatively unscathed. This game of cat-and-mouse continued for
    a whole week, except it was the Caldari who were in the role of the mouse.\n\nThe
    administration and military command was becoming uneasy. Very few forces remained
    in Caldari Prime orbit to prevent the evacuation. It became clear that unless
    Tovil-Toba\u2019s forces were destroyed and/or removed from Gallente Prime orbit,
    the Caldari would be able to leave their homeworld wholesale, effectively depleting
    Luminaire of an entire world and precipitating economic collapse. \n\nTheir operations
    against Caldari Admiral Yakiya Tovil-Toba stepped up, until only one ship remained,
    a badly damaged fighter-carrier called the Kairiola, a retrofitted water freighter.
    Less than a quarter of the Caldari remained on their homeworld, just a week short
    of the one month of uncontested orbital control required for the full evacuation.
    Knowing there was not enough time left, Tovil-Toba directed the huge vessel down
    towards the Gallente homeworld in a last ditch attempt to distract the Federation.\n\n####
    Hueromont Incident\nOn entering the atmosphere, the ship broke into several burning
    pieces, killing all aboard. While most pieces fell into the ocean, the largest
    segment struck the city of [Hueromont](1PzpjLA0ZHtQRZu2f8x4gO), killing roughly
    two million people instantly and thousands more in the resulting fallout, which
    blackened the sky for miles in every direction. Luminaire was thrown into disarray,
    utter turmoil enveloping Gallente Prime. The Ultra-Nationalists feared that a
    Caldari counterstrike against the Gallente homeworld was imminent, and immediately
    recalled all vessels in the system to garrison the orbital zones, assist in humanitarian
    relief, and guard against the enemy attack. This attack never took place, however,
    and millions more Caldari were able to leave their homeworld for good.\n\nThe
    cosmopolitan makeup of Hueromont meant that it was more than just the local Gallente
    that were amongst the casualties; a good many ethnic Intaki and Mannar citizens
    were amongst the dead as well. As a result, the entire Federation felt the aftershocks
    of what came to be known as the Hueromont Incident. There was a great sense of
    anger against the Ultra-Nationalist regime, blaming them to be the root cause
    of all the turmoil. \n\nSome felt their failings to adequately defend Gallente
    Prime had led to this catastrophe, while many others believed that this was an
    inevitable consequence of war, and thus such a circumstance should have never
    came about to begin with. Mayor Jen Yiona was at the forefront of channeling the
    anger of the population, which was not directed against the Caldari, but against
    the U-Nats in power. She was able to rally other states on Gallente Prime against
    the Federal government, and soon other planets followed, including the Intaki
    and Mannar homeworlds.\n\nWith the marginal victory of the Caldari, the Battle
    of Luminaire was finally over, after three bloody months of the fiercest fighting
    of the war. A ceasefire was called, as both sides consolidated themselves in the
    aftermath. The ceasefire would last for slightly over a year, as the Caldari did
    not complete the evacuation of their homeworld until FC35 (23156AD)."

- body: "### The Reform Years\n#### Yiona's Revolution\n##### Garoun Conflict\nAfter
    the Hueromont Incident, President Luc Duvailer and his Ultra-Nationalists found
    their powerbase severely weakened, but nonetheless they attempted to maintain
    their grip on power. Civil conflicts erupted; on worlds with weak central presence,
    states rallied their local militias or defense forces against the Federal garrisons
    there, while other provinces attempted to side with the ailing U-Nats. The situation
    was most problematic on Mannar, while Intaki saw more peaceful protests than anything.
    Desertions across the military took place, while the nations on Gallente Prime
    who originally attempted to secede from the Federation found themselves vindicated.\n\nUnder
    the influence of Hueromont Mayor Jen Yiona, many nations on Gallente Prime mobilized
    their planetside armies to prepare for an invasion of Central Garoun, home to
    the Federal capital of Caille. A stand-off ensued; the Gallente Prime armies knew
    that the Federation Navy would not be so daring enough to bombard them orbit,
    given the fact that this was the Gallente homeworld, but they were equally aware
    that Duvailer and his Ultra-Nationalists may just be megalomaniacal enough to
    do so. Other than some border clashes, this invasion never reached fruition.\n\nProtests
    outside the presidential palace in Caille took place, some incidents brutally
    repressed by local police. It was clear that Duvailer and the Ultra-Nationalists
    had to go, but with the Constitution and Charter suspended, there would be few
    avenues for a peaceful transition of power. Factions within the Federation military
    aligned with anti-Duvailer politicians began to plan a coup d'\xE9tat, but the
    Intaki within the Senate were key in invoking diplomatic restraint and preventing
    a violent collapse of the Federation. \n\n##### Fall of the Ultra-Nationalists\nMany
    were thankful, then, that President Duvailer signed the metaphorical end of his
    career by retracting the state of martial law over the Federation, hoping this
    would please the angry masses. Instead, almost the entire Senate passed a vote
    of no confidence on the President, with representatives previously aligned to
    the U-Nats renouncing their support. With a near-unanimous vote, President Duvailer
    was forced to step down.\n\nAs a complete surprise, Duvalier called elections
    to vote the President in directly by universal suffrage, with all Federal citizens
    eligible for candidacy by default. This had never been done before, as all Presidents
    were appointed from the Senate by chamber vote. It effectively set up Hueromont
    mayor Jen Yiona to become the next President, who was seen as a champion of the
    people against the tyrannical Ultra-Nationalists. Why former President Luc Duvalier
    decreed this remains a mystery within the history books to this day. Some believe
    it was simply a result of closed door agreements, while others see Duvalier as
    trying to redeem himself after falling from grace.\n\n####Yiona's Restoration\n#####Consolidation\nNewly-elected
    President Jen Yiona oversaw the formation of a new government towards the end
    of FC34 (23155AD), one that was significantly more moderate than the previous
    administration, and perhaps more open to peace. Unfortunately, this would not
    be so. The atrocities of the early days of the war were still fresh in the memory
    of the Federal citizenry; with the Ultra-Nationalists out of power, bitterness
    was levied against the Caldari instead. \n\nAfter the initial months of fighting,
    casualties on both sides were high. On the Caldari side, the orbital bombardment
    had killed millions without remorse. On the Federal side, the ethnic violence
    and armed conflict on Caldari Prime running up to the attack on Nouvelle Rouvenor
    had killed just as many, with the Hueromont Incident adding to these woes further.
    Though the death toll was slightly higher on the Federation side, the Caldari
    had suffered a much greater dent in their population overall. As a result, neither
    side was willing to forgive or forget what had taken place, meaning the war would
    continue for some time yet, despite moderating calls for diplomacy from both President
    Yiona and many Intaki Senators.\n\n##### Repopulation of Caldari Prime\nThe Hueromont
    Government, as it became known, was faced with several issues that required the
    Federation\u2019s immediate attention. First, the economy in Luminaire was tanking,
    with an entire world depleted of the majority of its population. There were a
    few million Gallente residing in the underwater cities on Caldari Prime, as well
    as a handful of ethnic Caldari who refused to leave their ancestral homes, including
    tribal groups within the [Kaalakiota Peaks](tSXx52ZNNlyu2MYXtOiMT). The Federation
    did not dare order any relocations, especially with the authoritarianism of the
    Ultra-Nationalists fresh in everyone\u2019s minds. In addition, order had completely
    broken down. The governments and nation-states on Caldari Prime had become virtually
    non-existent, while a relatively small guerilla force left by the Chief Executive
    Panel contributing to the small-scale anarchy.\n\nA peacekeeping force was sent
    to Caldari Prime to either eradicate or capture the guerillas, and oversee the
    reconstruction of the homeworld. The Federation redrew the borders of Caldari
    Prime, restoring the most prominent historic nations in some areas (primarily
    on the Tikiona continent), or creating new ones where it was deemed convenient
    or beneficial. Elections were called in a few regions, though in others, the Federation
    was forced to appoint new leaders, as there were simply not enough citizens for
    a vote. \n\nA massive repopulation effort was undertaken by the Federation, offering
    massive incentives for anyone who would choose to make the somewhat deserted Caldari
    Prime their new home. Private corporations were contracted en masse in the reconstruction
    of areas that suffered from orbital bombardment. The proximity of the Gallente
    homeworld meant that the majority of new inhabitants of Caldari Prime were ethnic
    Gallente in origin, though there were plenty of Intaki and Mannar that moved to
    the wartorn world, even a small amount of ethnic Caldari from other areas in the
    Federation. Within a decade, Caldari Prime had been restored to its pre-war state.\n\n####
    Yiona's Renewal\n##### Resumption\nThe second immediate problem facing the Federation
    was the fact that there was still a war ongoing, the ceasefire having been broken
    by border clashes. During the political transition within the Federation, the
    Caldari were able to settle into their new homes within the State and start building
    an infrastructure to restore their military. They were quicker to recover than
    the Federation was. Before long, the State was able to secure previously Caldari
    colonies within Essence and Verge Vendor. \n\nThe region of [Sinq Laison](3GIruDG2rn9qF2j8uXlR5r),
    meanwhile, was a hodgepodge of Gallente and Caldari states and colonies that the
    latter had started to resecure, then proceeded one step further by conquering
    the Gallente territories as well, placing them under harsh military rule as a
    punishment for the Ultra-Nationalist treatment of the Caldari. Even with the moderate
    government in power, this was deemed unacceptable, and thus campaigns were launched
    to liberate captured areas in Essence and Verge Vendor, conceding Sinq Laison
    to the State for the time being.\n\n##### Intaki and Mannar pressures\nThe influential
    role the Intaki and Mannar had played within the Federation and all the crises
    up until this point meant that they were stronger members of the union than ever
    before, their political and economic muscles metaphorically prominent. The Intaki
    and Mannar within the Senate had started to apply significant pressure to the
    Federation to deal with the immediate problems facing the nation, though both
    were at two extremes. The Intaki believed the young Federation must not be shaken
    by this crisis so early on in its existence, and that stability should be restored
    peacefully and through defensive military action.\n\nThe Mannar felt the same
    way as the Intaki, though they believed that the Caldari secession was abhorrent.
    They saw the Caldari as prideful and arrogant, criticizing them for championing
    the greater good in their culture yet abandoning the Federation, who the Mannar
    felt represented the true collective good. The Mannar wanted stability to return,
    but saw the Caldari as enemies and traitors to the Federation and humanity itself,
    desiring more extreme methods in dealing with them compared to the Intaki.\n\n#####
    Hueromont Doctrine\nIn response to the above pressures, the Gallente Senators,
    who were still in majority within the Federal Senate, were forced to treat the
    Caldari as rebels and renegades. It was believed that they must be brought back
    into the Federal fold either peacefully or militarily, lest the Intaki and Mannar
    interpret the failure to do so as either weakness or incompetence. Should the
    Federation fail in dealing with the Caldari situation, the Intaki, Mannar and
    others may be tempted to secede as well, thus throwing the whole union into turmoil.
    This approach became known as the Hueromont Doctrine.\n\n#### Yiona's Reconciliation\nA
    third and less immediate issue within the Federation was the nature of the union
    itself. A popular conspiracy had emerged against the corporate elites that had
    influence at the highest levels of government, as well as the individual nation-states
    that wielded significant control. They were seen as irrevocably tied to the Ultra-Nationalists
    and/or being able to exert control over the union with no democratic mandate.
    Some even associated them with the Caldari, who were now governed exclusively
    by megacorporations. More pressing, however, was the matter of the Ultra-Nationalists,
    and what should be done with them.\n\n##### Tovil Trials\nWith the heavy weight
    of authoritarianism lifted, voices began to emerge that would have been labelled
    dissident or traitorous under the previous government. While they still saw the
    Caldari as selfish and prideful, they nonetheless saw the Ultra-Nationalists as
    far more criminal than the Caldari could ever be. They vehemently disagreed with
    the bombardment of Caldari Prime, even going as far as to call it an attempt at
    genocide, and saw Duvailer and his irk as tyrants that must be punished for their
    actions in ruling the Federation. President Yiona was in sympathy with these individuals.
    The Ultra-Nationalists were outlawed and, within the military establishment, senior
    officers who were associated with the party were stripped off their command. This
    was not enough to please the masses, however. Duvailer and all his associates,
    both military and civilian, were arrested, to be put on trial by a special tribunal.\n\nThe
    tribunal was to be held in the partially-reconstructed city of Tovil, mostly as
    a symbolic gesture. On the tribunal\u2019s staff included the President herself
    and various other high-ranking Federal politicians. The Ultra-Nationalist leadership
    included Luc Duvailer, former members of his cabinet, advisors, and ex-officers
    from the Federation military command at the time. They were charged with gross
    incompetence, failures of leadership, corruption, violations of Federal Law, and
    crimes against humanity. Critics derided the trials as nothing but a populist
    maneuver to please the masses, drawing attention away from the fact that some
    associates of the Ultra-Nationalists were completely ignored by the authorities.\n\nDespite
    mild criticism, the trials took place. While historians have debated the validity
    of evidence for genocide, the majority of the U-Nats were charged with lesser
    crimes against humanity. Luc Duvailer, however, did not escape these accusations.
    He was found guilty of all charges levied against him, although execution was
    ruled out, President Yiona believing that this sentence would make the Federation
    no better than the Ultra-Nationalists. Instead, Luc Duvailer was exiled to the
    Intaki Syndicate, and was never heard from again.\n\n##### Elite Purges\nWith
    the Ultra-Nationalists dealt with, scrutiny passed through the backlog of the
    Federation\u2019s actions under the previous regime, seeking to make amends. Reconciliation
    with the Intaki Syndicate was brought up but dismissed quickly, noting that the
    damage had been done and was beyond repair. In addition, few disagreed with the
    fact that many of the original Intaki Five Thousand were of a questionable background,
    even under the moderate government. The Syndicate was showing signs of becoming
    a haven for illegal activities that would thrive under a wartime environment,
    something that the Federation wanted nothing to do with.\n\nVarious laws that
    regulated the activities of corporations as well as their executives were passed,
    in an attempt to curb the influence of wealthy elites within the Federation. Politicians
    with illegal corporate sponsorships were rooted out and torn apart by the media,
    and even relatively trivial missteps were the target of a popular frenzy. They
    were effective at first, but as the years passed, these corporations were able
    to entrench themselves amongst the various legal loopholes that they eventually
    discovered and exploited. Individual member-states were also looked at with scrutiny,
    particularly ones that proved influential within the Federation, for better or
    for worse.\n\n#### Yiona's Reform\nIn order to prevent future divisions, many
    policymakers and citizens felt that unity and allegiance to the Federation as
    the sole nation of humanity should be emphasized over all else. Identifying by
    one\u2019s home country was seen as fragmenting and contributing to the problems
    that saw the Caldari depart. A standardized system of democracy implemented at
    the interstellar level would be see as one of the means to this ideal of galactic
    unity and nationhood, based on the individual citizen, rather than focusing on
    nations using the Federation as a forum to compete against one another.\n\n#####
    Three pillars of power\nThis all fell under a series of laws known as the Hueromont
    Reforms. The social and political shocks of the Caldari secession and the brief
    but brutal rule of the Ultra-Nationalists rapidly raised many questions as to
    the nature of the Federation, and how it could be changed to prevent any such
    calamities from happening again. Many ideas were brought forward in the popular,
    academic, and political arenas, that manifested together into a sweeping law called
    the Further Federation Act. The first notable point of this bill was implementing
    a system of checks and balances to prevent another totalitarian government from
    wrestling control undemocratically, especially a single individual.\n\nTo this
    end, a Supreme Court was introduced as a judicial branch of the government to
    protect and uphold the Charter and Constitution. The President became its own
    executive branch, while the Senate would occupy the legislative branch. All three
    would have a clear separation of powers. Both the President and Senate would now
    be fully elected by popular vote every five years. \n\nNo branch would be superior
    in power to the other; the President can veto laws passed by the Senate, the Senate
    could impeach the President, while the Supreme Court could deem the actions of
    both to be illegal, but has no active or participating role in the governing or
    lawmaking of the Federation. The [Federal Administration](3FvIDT7Y2mQEOOCLVpy3kz)
    was reformed to become the bureaucracy to bind the union together, falling under
    the executive branch.\n\n##### Creation of districts and opt-out powers\nIn addition,
    many of the colonies of the Federal nations were not represented in the Senate
    before the Hueromont Reforms. They began to demand equal standing in the union
    with threats of declaring independence and going their own way as the Caldari
    did. To this end, as a part of the Further Federation Act, districts replaced
    the administrative division of sectors, which were previously used to economically
    and militarily group systems. \n\nMost districts would take up a single constellation,
    while particularly populous constellations were split into two districts. Senators
    would no longer have their constituencies as the individual member countries,
    but would represent the districts instead. This meant that all citizens within
    a district would receive equal representation in the Senate. By their very nature,
    districts granted colonies under the administration of home nations full independence.
    They would also be granted their own parliaments and courts, giving the nations
    there the ability to control constellation politics. Unlike before, nations could
    no longer influence Federation-level politics.\n\nBefore the laws were implemented,
    however, the countries of the four major homeworlds (especially the reformed Caldari
    Prime states) offered resistance. They were not willing to sacrifice their representation
    to be put on equal footing with their former colonies. Extremely resentful, the
    appointed representatives of these nations offered stiff resistance to the elected
    half of the Senate, who became the champions of the people during this popular
    reform.\n\nA compromise was reached; the Further Federation Act would create the
    power of 'opt-out', which allowed a member state to refuse to take part in certain
    elements of the Federation's laws. The majority of opt-out states would be Luminaire
    or Intaki in origin. Special ruling could override opt-out power in theory, but
    this ultimately never took place in Federation history. \n\nOne notable consequence
    of the creation of districts was that it disallowed member states to operate colonies
    outside of their constellation. The biggest loser was the Intaki Assembly, who
    previously controlled much of the Placid region. Their influence was reduced massively
    as a result, but many other signatories also lost territory as well.\n\n#####
    Implementation\nIn FC41 (23162AD), the Further Federation Act was put into force
    after a couple of years of open debate and discussion, stalled by the fierce early
    battles of the Gallente-Caldari War. One major stipulation of the Act was moving
    the Federal capital from the city of Caille on Gallente Prime, to the culturally
    neutral Villore solar system, as a matter of political sensitivity towards the
    other members. The fourth planet of Villore, called Libertopolis, became the new
    capital planet. It took even more time for the Further Federation Act to even
    be implemented in many places across the union, especially in the territories
    that became Sinq Laison, which were either occupied or wartorn due to Caldari
    marauders.\n\nEventually, the Federation was finally able to shift the frontlines
    to Sinq Laison and begin a systematic liberation of the conquered territories
    there, allowing the political transition. Many of the smaller settlements that
    the Caldari abandoned were ruthlessly destroyed through a scorched earth doctrine,
    inflicting heavy civilian casualties. This only fueled the Federation\u2019s resolve,
    and drew the war out for several more decades to come. However, the Further Federation
    Act was subsequently implemented wholesale across all Federal territories. \n\nThe
    end of President Jen Yiona's administration and the continuation of war into Sinq
    Laison marked the end of the Luminate Era, a short but violent period that would
    remain a landmark age for all [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk).\n"

description: The Luminate Era of the Gallente Federation (or the Early Federate Era)
  covers the time from the creation of the interstellar union in 23121AD to just before
  first contact with the Jin-Mei in 23168AD. It is noted by the initial tensions within
  the Federation, the secession of the Caldari and the outbreak of the Gallente-Caldari
  War, and the subsequent reforms in response. Though the Luminate Era lasted less
  than a century, its landmark events would shape the history of the Gallente and
