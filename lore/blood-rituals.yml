    staple of [Sani Sabik](TDJbDXVg3cRp4b6FEkkFS) rituals.


    At one point, the blood was only used in initiation rituals, but over the centuries
    the Sani Sabik began involving it in all rituals in an effort to find eternal
    life. Some of their sects use rather inoffensive rituals, while in others they
    are quite gruesome.


    Certain sects supposedly keep blood farms of people to be repeatedly drained.
    There are even rumors that some sects have cannibalistic and necrophiliac rites.


    The most notorious sect of all, the [Blood Raiders](7obiU8rOyJkPZ3S0Faxc5W), once
    drained children, but recently began to drain cloned people after being taken
    over by [Omir Sarikusa](6UYaNpBPqY1ls1ps78PPPt).
