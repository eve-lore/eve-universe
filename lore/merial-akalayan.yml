- body: 'Dr. **Merial Akalayan** is senior assistant to Dr. Chieran Kenitawri and

    a scientist in her own right. After Chieran assigns her to a weeks-long

    research project reviewing virtually abandoned archives, Merial comes

    across a startling discovery: an artifact recently retrieved from

    wormhole space near [Akora](5W5xBtHU03t8vQzhgMujc1) in the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy)
    bears a striking resemblance to one excavated

    sometime during the previous century on [Matar](5gheCRHTWLbi5jzbo5vvT6), which

    is nearly five light-years away from Akora. Both objects are around

    fifteen thousand years of age. Merial postulates they are a kind of

    ancient fractal acceleration shell equalizer due to their similar design

    regarding a series of nodes present on each. This discovery excites both

    her and Chieran because the size of the artifacts suggests the

    corresponding ship engines would have been enormous, larger even than a

    modern dreadnought.
