    a thriving world with over a billion inhabitants.


    Political status

    ----------------


    As it lies on the border between [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) and [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
    space, it is theoretically an important world, but in reality has served little
    function. It was once under [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) protection, but
    apparently this is no longer the case, or at least is no longer a deterrent to
    capsuleer

    assault. Its administrator is [Leonalle Yvesk](5qnge8y8YaWVmIoatjJv5E).


    [Capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) interest

    ------------------------------------------


    The planet contains carbon compounds under its southern continents. Interested
    in exploring these, the capsuleer [Omvistus''s](14Seg6wEOEpNHopnuUbUtZ) corporation
    deployed several mining facilities and 72 new spaceports on the planet. Despite
    opposition from planetside forces - the facilities were placed in populated areas
    -

    Omvistus was able to threaten Yvesk with orbital bombardment in order to get his
    way.
