- body: 'Archaea are single-celled organisms found in all manners of habitats.


    One notable example was found inside an asteroid that landed near [Outpost 4972](7lJLYLN8srQsuRHZJsCfVR).
    The archaea lived in sealed pockets inside the asteroid and interacted in unusual
    ways with the metals inside. Information on the archaea was apparently valuable,
    as [Szekel](2KLlyAO4njOMOllcdmqgtv) stole it, causing the launch of an intense
    investigation.
