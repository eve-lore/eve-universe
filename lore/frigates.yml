    operation without the support of a larger ship. The basic concept of the frigate
    has its roots in the earliest space flight, but the modern frigate was first employed
    by the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) as a counter to [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK)
    [drones](3o5QhCbx71nILKNnW9S7v1) in the [Caldari-Gallente War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV).
    Today, frigates constitute the majority of standard fleets and are utilized in
    a variety of roles, particularly their more advanced counterparts. \n\n\n### History\nThe
    earliest ships to be called frigates were developed by the Caldari in 23216 AD,
    but the concept predates their design by centuries. The [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
    utilized small, armed two-person ships called Scouts for generations, while the
    Gallente favored heavier, slower ships that were nonetheless too small to be properly
    termed cruisers. These early designs were not intended for true combat, however,
    being mainly utilized for reconnaissance and transport.\n\nThe Caldari were the
    first to exploit the strengths of the ships for combat. For decades, the Caldari
    had deployed single-man fighter craft which were highly maneuverable against the
    Federation. However, once the Gallente developed the drone, the fighters proved
    far too fragile to stand toe-to-toe with the automated drones. The Caldari response
    was relatively simple; they improved the shielding on their fighters and added
    extra weapons. These new ships required more crew, but retained the agility of
    the fighters while adding in superior survivability. Once the Caldari acquired
    the [capsule](2klMsyfd5quK05XnGL9wNB) from the [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G)
    several years later, they were able to reduce the crew compliment to just the
    pilot, further strengthening the ship class.\n\nThe frigate displayed its strengths
    spectacularly in the [Battle of Vak'Atioth](1Cq1o1feVsJi6HuaVZs1L4). The heavier
    Amarr ships were unable to pin down the nimble Jove frigates, while their larger
    weapons were unable to score direct hits. The Jove utilized their smaller vessels
    to devastate the Amarr vessels, inflicting the largest single defeat in the history
    of the Empire.\n\nSince then, frigates have become mainstays in every traditional
    navy, filling a variety of roles from scout, to tackler, to fast transport. The
    frigate hull has proven to be one of the most versatile in New Eden, giving rise
    to no less than five high-tech variant; the [Interceptor](5tDUsKRPyntVMgukOtqMaY),
    Assault Ship, Electronic Attack Ship, Stealth Bomber, and Covert Ops Ship.\n\n\n###
    Design\nFrigates are primarily defined by their small size and superior agility.
    Most are little bigger than shuttles or fighters, and thus retain much of the
    agility of their weaker cousins, but are reinforced with extra armor and shielding
    and additional weapons. The basic frigate is capable of inflicting a fair amount
    of damage for a ship its size, while being able to avoid the direct fire of larger
    ships while still being capable of absorbing a few shots before being destroyed.\n\nFrigates
    tend to be fairly simplistic in basic design, featuring a cockpit, a single living
    space, a combined engineering and gunnery sections, plus a small cargo bay. Some
    individual frigates can vary this layout slightly, such as sacrificing cargo space
    for additional living quarters or a more extensive scientific section, depending
    on their intended usage. \n\nBecause frigates are designed for few crew, they
    tend to have fairly advanced automation processes in comparison to larger ships.
    Capsuleer ships may possess only the pilot, meaning any problems need to be solved
    by automation rather than relying on crew to fix.\n\n\n### Crew\nBecause of their
    small size, frigates do not require very large [crew](3XUeMME0mskbriwkDeYNHs)
    compliments. In fact, many smaller frigates are designed to be flown by a solo
    capsuleer, with no crew support whatsoever. At most, a single assistant will aide
    in the event of emergencies. \n\nOn non-capsuleer and larger frigates, the crews
    tend to number no more than a dozen at maximum, though more people can fit on
    board for transport. The smallest, most lightly-armed frigates usually have a
    crew compliment of five; a pilot, an engineer, a gunner, and two generalists who
    can replace the others in emergencies. Larger frigates tend to utilize more engineers
    and gunners, with specialists in other areas as determined for the ship's mission.\n\nIt's
    commonly assumed that most frigate crew members are raw recruits. In truth, because
    they are required to act without backup and frequently cover for others, they
    are usually veterans who have proven their skills in a variety of areas.\n\n\n###
