- body: '**Bix Arramida** is an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) pilot and scavenger.


    Murderous salvage

    -----------------


    He was hired by [Norid](d0TCigr19wOAZ4XCKGXG1) to salvage 15 people in [cryo-sleep](27h0INK6WG8rbVJJAKSPkN)
    off a derelict [luxury yacht](5T1KWZHynGdVhmduNdnYl0) in the system of Rethan.
    He lacked the equipment to board the ship, so he cut it open with lasers, killing
    the people - who he wasn''t required to bring back alive, and about whose health
    he was entirely unconcerned. Afterwards he delivered the biomass to a [cloning](5y5CUyA9h4xXY40dInhn3o)
    facility on [Rethan V](luH9ECzVOhtEPTddq96PV), and collected his payment.


    Bix was unsure of the true nature of his work or the man who hired him. Though
    he did not know it, one of the bodies was the son of Norid''s rival.
