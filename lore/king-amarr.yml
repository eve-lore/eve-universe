- body: '**The King** is an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) prisoner who lives in
    the

    dark swamps near on a [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) prison colony.

    Some time ago he escaped the prison and went into hiding in a nearby

    jungle, where he currently ekes out a spooky sort of living.


    There is palpable fear and awe of him in the prison camp. He has come to

    an unspoken understanding with the guards at the camp, so that prisoners

    who find favor with him are spared the harshest treatment in the camp.


    The catch on the prisoners'' end, though, is that anyone who seeks his

    favor must first realize the King exists at all - a challenge to many -

    after which they must accept the chaos of the camp, and finally enter

    the jungle to seek out the King out. The King himself views this as him

    giving faith to the prisoners. [Prisoner 47](291ttffsRj3Ab0ZJnVmjs1) is

    a typical example of someone who was lost and then realized he was

    found, in the fold of the King.
