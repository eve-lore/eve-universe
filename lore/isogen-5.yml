    isogen found only in blue bright star (Type O1) systems. Its rarity is

    at a point that until recently it was half-believed to be only

    Isogen-5 may have been used to fuel [Jamyl Sarum](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L)''s superweapon.


    This mineral variant has been deliberately placed throughout every

    system in [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) and beyond in

    numerous stockpiles for a very specific, unknown purpose by an ancient

    race with a vision beyond the grasp of modern science, and the

    technological advancement to execute that vision.
