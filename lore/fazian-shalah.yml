    who is a member of the [Kor-Azor Family](1S0FEGgzJiwc4yXaG5AzjD) court.


    His accounts were frozen, his property confiscated, and his business brought to
    a halt after, in a moment of drunken revelry, he made an impolite comment about
    the forehead decoration of then-[Imperial Chancellor](7GOV3morIu47J3BmidrhU8)
    [Serude Sakekoo](61qEuUN1TYXfSo6PzwHtgR). He and his famiy were left destitute
    afterward, so in desperation Fazian turned to [Aritcio Kor-Azor](2puF18pxR6b7AVuy3HE9IV)
    to intervene.


    After some deliberation, Aritcio agreed that Sakekoo''s actions had been unjust
    and ordered Shalah''s accounts unfrozen, his property either returned or compensated
    for, and his position restored. However, to ensure that he had learned his lesson
    about insulting others, Kor-Azor ordered that Shalah''s tongue be cut out.


    Dumbstruck, Shalah was dragged out by guards. Shortly after, a [Speaker of Truths](3GdUiafeRMQKdpzDb8CWnJ)
    arrived to address the grievances of Holders against Aritcio, so it is unknown
    if Kor-Azor''s sentence was carried out.
