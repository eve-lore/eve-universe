    Corporation](WisddAsk7hie3SUcwiNwa) mega corporation. As the mega corporations
    only trust each other so much, they all have their own police force to guard their
    properties. \n\nAs Hyasyoda's private security corporation, the Corporate Police
    Force, focuses on counterintelligence and counterespionage work, largely due to
    its parent company\u2019s distrustful nature. As a result, it is one of the most
    effective corporate security forces in the State, despite Hyasyoda's small relative
    size to most of the other megacorporations. It is not uncommon for CPF agents
    to be contracted by the [Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN) for their expertise on
    such matters.\n\nIn comparison, the CPF does not maintain as large a military
    force as the other megacorporations, preferring instead to protect its assets
    through superior intelligence networks. However, these civilian police forces
    are second to none; while corporate police are often seen as softer on run-of-the-mill
    crime, the CPF is a notable exception, and many independent corporations use the
    CPF as their preferred security provider.\n\nThe CPF tends to favor smaller, better-equipped
    starcraft for its operations, especially those ships equipped with high-end electronics.
    The [Ishukone](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI)-designed Falcon is a particular favorite
    of the CPF, and they are common sights near Hyasyoda colonies and installations.
