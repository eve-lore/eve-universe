- body: '**Laser weapons** are high powered lasers that emit coherent beams of light
    to damage their target. However, they require enormous amounts of energy, so a
    personal-based application is a little tricky. They are favored by the [Amarr
    Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) and, apparently, the [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G)
    as well.


    Variants

    --------


    Some laser weapons have an integral power supply but are not very powerful and
    thus largely insufficient for engaging targets in heavy body armor. Other types,
    especially military rifles, use an external miniature reactor strapped to the
    users back and can provide excellent firepower with extraordinary accuracy.


    Advantages

    ----------


    On a side note, lasers do not require ammunition, only energy, and thus ease the
    logistic burden of ground forces. Handheld laser weapons are predominantly used
    by the Amarr and in the [Khanid Kingdom](5VtgxEr1vnxuazt8lvQLoj).
