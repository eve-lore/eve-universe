- body: '**Heart-of-the-Forest** is one of the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy)

    spirits.


    Heart-of-the-Forest is the spirit of the mighty kresh trees, of things

    that are green and growing. The Winds protect her, but often they bring

    a temporary pain to her to spare a greater suffering. She is the great

    provider for the Caldari, her wood builds and heats their homes, her

    game fills their bellies and clothes their skin, and her leaves and

    branches hide them from their enemies. She also uses her resources

    wisely; everything in the forest serves a purpose, however small.

    Heart-of-the-Forest is perhaps the best known teacher among the spirits,

    aside from Cold Wind, although she rarely tells anyone anything

    directly, preferring to teach by example. She is prominent in Caldari

    beliefs about the home and hearth, and part of the reason Caldari tend

    to prefer wood in their buildings, especially homes.


    Other divine entities include

    [Wind-of-the-West](3FsbhfAVn48VZcWAXiTReI), [Cold Wind](16iSgSK58hOq8DIlx2oqKS),
    [Mountain Wind](NEtuLo38zgFK9ZA0sGYCk),

    and [Storm Wind](vAU7b4dGGPGQNp6QRw6mX).
