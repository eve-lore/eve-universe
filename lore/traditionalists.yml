- body: 'The **Traditionalists**, a group composed mostly of historians and

    archeologists, were involved with the standardization of timekeeping in

    [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk).


    When the need for a standardized time throughout New Eden was

    identified, they said the only way to go was to base the new calendar as

    much as possible on the 24-hour, 365-day calendar favored by early

    post-collapse settlers. All the races, especially the

    [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G) and the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo), had some
    data

    on the old calendar and by combining the data it could be remade more or

    less in its original form.


    The Traditionalists focused their lobbying on the politicians of each

    faction, which turned out to be a wise choice once it came to light that

    the decision would be political in nature. They were opposed by the

    [Arithmetics](6EZHhVXjVATis74MVHrO1B), who believed a new calendar

    should be founded on a scientific basis. When the final decision was

    made aboard the Jovian cruiser Yoiul, the Traditionalists won

    comfortably. A day would be divided into 24 hours and the year 365 days

    with an additional day every 4 years, the same as the calendar of the

    early settlers.
