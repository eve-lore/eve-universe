- body: '**Mining colonies** use equipment which creates sounds which can be

    heard throughout the colony and may be described as a "buzzing, grinding

    sound, like flies in a jar."


    They often have their own local police force. Justice meted out by the

    same is sometimes specialized and often brutal.


    Residences located in mining colonies have private water showers, but

    laundry facilities are communal and designed to conserve water.
