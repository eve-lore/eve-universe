    in the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) behind the [Nugoeihuvi Corporation](4Ykng1Buej1uH3Sy5ln3jW).
    A subsidiary of [Kaalakiota](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK), Echelon has become increasingly
    popular since its founding in YC89 primarily due to its focus on cultivating an
    outward Caldari cultural identity and preserving heritage via visual and musical
    productions; today its programs are regularly broadcasted on Caldari channels.
    The Caldari-focused content means it has a very small foreign market. Kaalakiota
    has shown little to no interest in actively expanding Echelon beyond State borders.\n\n\n###History\n####Origins\nIn
    the years running up to the capsuleer era, [Sukuuvestaa](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB)
    and the rest of the Practical bloc dominated the Caldari State\u2019s politics
    and economy. Kaalakiota and the other Patriot megacorporations felt the ancient
    Caldari culture was being undermined by what they saw as unrestricted and unabashed
    corporatism on the part of the Practicals. KK felt these corporations showed no
    respect for traditional practices, instead focusing on pure profiteering.\n\nIn
    addition, those who had lived through the [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV)
    were beginning to die out, leaving a generation free from war, who Kaalakiota
    felt were apathetic to the sacrifices that came before. Changing the enculturation
    process of children was not enough, as many adults were considered by KK as unappreciative
    of history. Kaalakiota thus took it upon themselves to adapt to the changing social
    and political environment, in order to preserve the ancient culture.\n\n\n####Initial
    attempts and failures\nIn YC89, Kaalakiota formed Raata Productions. Its first
    programs were ancient Raata stage plays updated for a modern audience. However,
    as the commercial arts are typically looked down upon by the Caldari populace
    (due to the perceived habits of such practices defying the social order), Raata
    Productions did not have access to high-level experienced actors or actresses,
    selecting low- to mid-level ones almost at random. At first, the majority of the
    audiences did not particularly seem to notice the quality of acting, used to watching
    combat tournaments instead.\n\nAfter the initial novelty period, KK found that
    viewers were primarily composed of either the Caldari arts niche (an extremely
    negligible segment of the State population) or the executive class. The viewership
    of these demographics was dwindling by the week, as both groups were educated
    enough to identify the poor quality of the productions. This was on top of the
    general Caldari populace moving back to the more typical preferences of engaging
    with gambling and combat sports. What only provoked a response from KK was after
    they caught wind of prolific [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) and [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
    critics writing up extremely poor reviews of the productions, the corporation
    seeing it as a point of national pride that Caldari culture should not be insulted
    by foreigners.\n\n\n####Rebranding and success\nInstead, Kaalakiota decided to
    capitalize on primarily having an audience amongst the well-off executives, believing
    that a sense of cultural pride would 'trickle down' to the lower classes. They
    rebranded Raata Productions as Echelon Entertainment, named after the fact they
    were aiming at a particular echelon of Caldari society. KK opened up so-called
    Echelon Academies, screening children from a young age to be trained and educated
    as entertainers loyal to the corporation's goal in this area. However, the academies
    required adults for the short-term. Kaalakiota were extremely selective in who
    they brought onboard, as they perceived Caldari who simply desired a platform
    for self-expression as dangerous to the established order.\n\nThe new Echelon
    Entertainment was a massive success amongst the executive class, and soon the
    entertainment company was able to branch out to other genres, such as dramatized
    poetry recitals based on the Caldari Breakout, and realistic recreations of the
    Gallente-Caldari War and ancient Cathura Rebellion. The Echelon Academies began
    teaching classical Raata music and unique compositions based off of the orchestral
    styles inherited from the Gallente. Holovision and television dramas based off
    of proverbs and unique cultural struggles followed, though these serials evolved
    to act as a commentary for everyday problems experienced by the individual Caldari
    citizen (though never the State itself).\n\n\n####Current day\nAlthough Echelon
    Entertainment's goal of cultivating the ancient Caldari culture amongst the general
    populace via a 'trickle down' theory was not a success, the vast revenue brought
    in by the productions kept the subsidiary as a successful long-term investment.
    Echelon was pushed to the interstellar fore after Kaalakiota negotiated broadcast
    rights within the territories of other State megacorporations. Despite this, the
    majority of Caldari would continue to engage in the popular pastime of gambling,
    something provided for by NOH, while the massive Gallente entertainment and media
    industry would fill in all other niches.\n\nSeeking to cater to areas in the Federation
    with a significant Caldari population, Gallente broadcasters negotiated for the
    syndication of Echelon productions in their own territories, but were refused
    wholesale by Kaalakiota. The megacorporation felt that State citizens who choose
    to migrate elsewhere are no longer worth of being called Caldari, and KK still
    saw a threat to their culture and heritage (as well as their security) by broadcasting
    to a foreign audience. The only exception came with exporting significantly dated
    productions, as well as Echelon News. Freedom of the media in the Federation meant
    that KK had significant license to broadcast whatever they desired through Echelon
    News (within reason).\n\nAfter Tibus Heth's successful reclamation of [Caldari
    Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i), members of the worker class began to take an interest
    in Echelon Entertainment, though it has since standardized back to historical
    metrics.\n\n\n###Products and Activities\nAlthough modern Caldari entertainment
    is defined by gambling on gladiatorial sports and other such competitions, Echelon
    Entertainment has decided to focus primarily on \u2018culturally Caldari\u2019
    visual and musical productions, from ancient Raata stage plays to drama serials
    focusing on stories relevant to State citizens. Echelon still runs some casinos
    and sports tournaments for the general market, but the vast majority of their
    content is consumed by the Patriot executive class. Echelon News is the media
    service for the Kaalakiota corporation, with talk show This Is The State being
    a somewhat notable production from the channel.\n\n\n####Gambling and Sports\nEchelon
    casinos can be found in Kaalakiota, [Lai Dai](5k5GiWRlFceyTjLSz71XT) and [Wiyrkomi](66psXtrftjRzA7MyKHtb7K)
    holdings, offering some competition to rival NOH establishments. The design of
    these casinos harken back to similar establishments before and during the industrial
    era on Caldari Prime. Gambling takes place over updated Raata games and sports,
    rather than MindClash or Splinterz, due to NOH market dominance in this sector.\n\n\n####Pleasure
    Resorts and Other Establishments\nEchelon Entertainment is noteworthy for operating
    traditional Caldari teahouses across the State, and not just in Kaalakiota holdings.
    These are perfect replicas of the same establishments that existed during the
    Raata Empire in the cities of Tovil and Arcurio, offering [tea](4BOy8Po101CMftW5kQdp8y)
    made from the leaves of kresh trees on New Caldari Prime or from astro-farms.
    Echelon has also purchased ownership of Caldari teahouses in the Federation to
    ensure these establishments are true to Caldari standards. State teahouses are
    commonly visited by mid- and top-level employees, and the establishments became
    very popular after being introduced during Echelon\u2019s rise.\n\nEchelon also
    operates many vacation resorts that seek to cultivate the Caldari heritage. Typical
    Caldari sand gardens are common, places of tranquility aimed at executives higher
    up in the corporate ladder. Tourists from other empires have a particular interest
    in these venues, but as Kaalakiota is highly protective of their resorts, they
    often double or treble prices for all foreigners who wish to visit an Echelon
    vacation site.\n\n\n####News and information networks\n''Echelon News'' was founded
    a few years after the rebranding of Raata Productions. As NOH's ''Caldari Today''
    was too well-entrenched in the State media network, ''Echelon News'' instead focused
    on simply informing Kaalakiota, Lai Dai, and Wiyrkomi citizens of what they needed
    to know (and what they didn't), ignoring foreign stories completely. The news
    service became popular in the Federation, as it was considered by Gallente viewers
    as a fascinating insight into how a State citizen is informed of events. When
    Kaalakiota began catering ''Echelon News'' specifically to a Gallente audience
    in the Federation, it became as equally popular as ''Caldari Today'' for its anti-establishment
    nature.\n\nTo rival the NOH production Games of State, Echelon Entertainment created
    ''This is the State''. The show is currently hosted by Iesa Murikomo, a former
    Echelon News anchor, and follows a format of in-depth interviews with political
    leaders, panel discussions, and political reporting from around the cluster courtesy
    of Echelon's news bureaus. While not quite as highly regarded among the political
    and intellectual elite as Games of State, ''This is the State'' has comparable
    market share. It is generally considered to be more representative of the Caldari
    political mainstream since Executor Tibus Heth\u2019s rise to power in YC110 and
    the resultant resurgence of Kaalakiota and her Patriot allies.\n\nSince the Provist
    rise to power, Echelon News and ''This is the State'' have seen noticeable change.
    Both are now indistinguishable from ''Caldari Today'' in being considered little
    more than pro-State propaganda, although Echelon News does not report on foreign
    events unlike its NOH counterpart. The same now occurs with talk show ''This is
    the State''. ''Games of State'' has become the only major program which goes against
    the established line in Caldari space.\n\n\n####Holoreels\nEchelon Entertainment
    is a notable producer of holoreels for broadcast and consumption primarily in
    the State, though it is possible to purchase Echelon reels from Kaalakiota retailers
    in other empires, or even from [FedMart](2Aa82GwowUlH7gWR8uItZU). These holoreels
    are mostly drama serials or feature films that are orientated towards a State
    audience, and are regarded as high quality despite the general Caldari disinclination
    towards such forms of entertainment. They appeal strongly to Gallente viewers
    appreciative of the Caldari-oriented content and the opportunity to further develop
    their interpretation of Echelon's productions.\n\nEchelon also produces holoreels
    that are live recordings of its various Raata-era stage plays. These are typically
    consumed by the [executive class](6IlywJfj3QI7SgzWoK5Z2g), as the bulk of the
    Caldari prefer the enhanced realities of gambling and sports over the alternate
    ones presented in visual media. The theater productions are recreated by both
    Caldari and non-Caldari living in the Federation, and are popular amongst high
    art circles.\n\n\n####Music\nEchelon Entertainment ignores producing popular music
    altogether, seeing the industry as too Gallente-oriented. Instead, they focus
    on classical and traditional Caldari music, either using orchestras in the styles
    inherited from the Gallente or much smaller folk assemblies of the Raata style.
    Employing corporate artists trained through Echelon Academies, orchestral performances
    are conducted before a live audience (typically wealthy executives), or via broadcast
    for other viewers. Echelon has a near-monopoly on all classical productions in
    the State.\n\n### See Also\n- [Kaalakiota Corporation](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK)\n-
