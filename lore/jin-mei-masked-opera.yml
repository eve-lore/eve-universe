    three primary castes, and many sub-castes within them, the culture has several
    means of easing tensions between the different groups. Traditionally, one of the
    most popular means by which caste divisions were prevented from boiling over into
    conflict was the Jin-Mei masked opera called "Lan-Bei." This form of opera remains
    highly popular at every level of Jin-Mei society.


    Stock characters within the Lan-Bei operas include the benevolent Sang Do overlord,
    the faithful Saan Go retainer, and the cheerful Jing Ko adventurer seeking his
    or her fortune. There are many variations on the basic caste themes, including
    the corrupt Saan Go-Si tax collector, a buffoonish Sang Do-Qi minor lord and a
    mercenary Kang Lo soldier. All of the standard characters and caste archetypes
    are represented by colorful and highly stylized masks that are always worn by
    performers in the Lan-Bei operas.


    Certain operas are written with a view to pleasing an audience of a particular
    caste, say a high status gathering of Sang Do lords, or a large theater full of
    Jing Ko workers. Others are more universal and in fact are the most popular and
    highly regarded operas, for these do not try to elevate one caste above another.
    Rather, they show both the good and bad sides of each group through well-developed
    characters and stories.'
