    military life to found [Mordu's Legion](5csCeDqUe1exvVyfPdL75Q)\nafter the First
    Gallente-Caldari war.\n\n### Early Life\n\nMuryia was a Deteis born on Hakonen
    III. It was clear that he was to have a\nsignificantly augmented path to greatness.
    The son of a Chief Risk\nOfficer for [Ishukone](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI) and a
    Senior Tech Officer initially under her\ncharge in the Caldari Navy, his parents'
    contribution to the State in\nthe ongoing Gallente-Caldari War meant they were
    able to afford quality\nmedical assistance during his mother's pregnancy and for
    months after\ndelivery.\n\nMuryia's education befitted a child that demonstrated
    an aptitude as\nboth an academic and a leader. Regularly identified in school
    reports as\nfocused, strategic, hungry for knowledge, loyal, liberal and meticulous,\nMordu
    also managed to earn the respect of his peers despite his\ndominance over many
    of them in the competitive environment of Caldari\nschooling.\n\nOne significant
    blot on his record came in his thirteenth year, when he\nmanaged to put another
    boy in hospital with significant spinal injuries\nduring a high tackle incident
    in a high profile contact sport\npreliminary final. The injured boys parents made
    an official complaint\nand intended to take the matter to the courts, saying that
    Muryia's\nactions had been entirely deliberate, and that there had been incidents\nbetween
    the boys before. Mordu faced expulsion, and while a subsequent\ncampus investigation
    was inconclusive, his reputation as a ruthless\nenforcer reportedly haunted him
    throughout his youth and reputedly led\nto his insistence that he act with honor
    (albeit often without mercy) in\nhis subsequent dealings with his enemies.\n\nMuryia's
    parents were approached before his mandatory military service\nto confirm what
    they already suspected - his military service would\nextend far beyond common
    conscription. Mordu was officer material, much\nlike his parents, and as the war
    with the Gallente continued, adepts\nsuch as he were invaluable to the Caldari
    war machine's longer term\nefforts.\n\n### The First Gallente-Caldari War\n\nMuryia's
    first active duty also resulted in his first service medal.\nDispatched as part
    of a reinforcement to a besieged fleet trying to\nextricate themselves from a
    protracted engagement in Iyen-Oursta in the\nGallente Border Zone. As a crippled
    Caldari presence attempted to remove\nthemselves to Perimeter. Several wings were
    sent in to protect their\nextraction, with Mordu being on one of the first ships
    to come to their\naide. His ship was the last to leave the system, itself severely\ndamaged.
    The only target for several moments, the vessel bore the full\nbrunt of the Gallente
    forces as it approached the gate. Only an ensign,\nMordu had raced to the side
    of ship's captain after a hit wounded and\nkilled members of the bridge crew.
    He immediately applied compress to a\nlife-threatening wound to the throat of
    his superior officer and\nproceeded to relay orders as the ship fled. It's said
    that at some point\nthe ship's captain had lost consciousness, though the orders
    still kept\ncoming.\n\nAs Mordu gained promotions and found increasing numbers
    of crew under\nhis command his missions typically involved assignment to fleets\nproviding
    orbital support or extracting ground forces during planetary\nengagements throughout
    Verge Vendor and Placid. Shortly after becoming a\ncaptain, it was his efforts
    in Intaki in YC8 that he was to earn the\nmost renown.\n\n### Extraction from
    Intaki V\n\nAfter several exchanges in the Woenckee and Viriette constellations,
    the\nCondor under his command was attacked over Intaki V. Mordu and the other\ncrew
    that had managed to survive the ship's destruction and their own\nsubsequent descent
    to the planet were marooned on the surface. To\nMordu's apparent displeasure,
    he was informed that due to increased\nenemy presence following the exchange,
    rescue was going to be denied\nuntil orbit could be secured. Preparing themselves
    for an extended stay,\nthey managed to rendezvous with the soldiers they had been
    sent to\nextract. They had then set about trying to dig in, blend in and secure\npassage
    off the planet themselves. After a deal soured with a local\ncriminal contact,
    the men were sheltered by sympathetic Intaki for a\nshort time before the Caldari
    Navy came for them. It was likely this\nexperience that not only ensured Mordu's
    future career path but in many\nways changed his perspective on his own dispensability,
    the darker side\nto his own character, particularly when in mortal combat, as
    well as his\ncapacity to engage with others on a blunter and more human level
    rather\nthan a structured and authoritative one.\n\nWhile his continuing command
    in the field earned him recognition as a\nbrilliant young Caldari officer, Muryia
    also gained the reputation of\nengaging in what those under his charge came to
    refer to as a \"whiskey\nsession.\" This tradition was a legacy of his time on
    Intaki V. Sometimes\nan honor, but on some occasions the death knell of someone's
    career, to\nbe invited into Muryia's quarters as he sat reviewing reports of an\nevening
    to find whiskey and two glasses meant that you had gained\nparticular attention.
    What usually started with a review of recent\nperformance would become a less
    formal as the hours wore on. If you\nlasted till morning, you could end up being
    promoted or entrusted with a\nparticular duty. If you left within minutes, you'd
    likely be facing a\ntransfer soon after. Reports held that Mordu did this in order
    to test\nhis troops' ability to function while under duress from exhaustion and\ndrugs,
    though several people who've participated in this kind of session\nhave later
    been quoted as saying that Mordu simply likes his drink.\n\nMuryia was also said
    to be more open-minded than other Caldari officers,\nwho generally tended to xenophobia
    towards non-Caldari races. A boon of\nhis upbringing amongst the more liberal
    ideals inculcated by those loyal\nto Ishukone, coupled with his experiences on
    Intaki V, Mordu\ndemonstrated that he was increasingly of the opinion that class
    or rank\ndid not determine the character of the person, nor the level of\nexpertise
    they possessed.\n\nHe would be later given command of Intaki officers who had
    chosen to\ndefect from the Gallente Federation to join the Caldari cause for\nindependence.
    Made up of a mix of navy and ground forces, Mordu was\ngiven the rank of Brigadier
    General with the formation of this brigade\nand charged with the continuation
    of a combination of fleet movements\nand ground skirmishes in enemy territory.\n\nHe
    immediately took a liking to the Intaki under his charge, and\nvice-versa. Together,
    they formed one of the more revered fighting units\nin the Caldari Navy during
    the last years of the war with the\nFederation, and their achievements were hailed
    as modern military\nlegend.\n\nAfter the conflict ended in YC12, Muryia shocked
    many when he retired\nfrom his military life. The Intaki under his command were
    invited to\nstay in Caldari society and granted accommodation in Waschi City on\n[Kamokor
    IV](yOVXgfGWF8UUaMX1vPAlK).\n\n### Waschi Uprising\n\nOver the many years that
    followed a nationalist movement took root on\nthe planet, centered on this city
    specifically due to the proportionally\nlarge presence of the Intaki residents.
    Many were the subject of\nvictimization and xenophobic attacks, incidents which
    went unchecked by\nlocal authorities as well. Eventually a full blown uprising
    against the\nCaldari government began in YC32 when Caldari authorities attempted
    to\nbring the city to order after almost daily violence. Intaki were being\nforcibly
    removed from their homes and brutalized. After several deaths\nthe Intaki war
    veterans called upon the assistance of their old\ncommander to quell the Waschi
    Uprising. Muryia Mordu agreed to help his\nfellow soldiers and formed a mercenary
    group which consisted mainly of\nthese Intaki war veterans. While they had all
    retired from active\nservice, they assisted Caldari authorities to crush the uprising
    with\nthe same efficiency that had defined them during the war, and started\nreferring
    to themselves as Mordu's Legion.\n\nDue to Muryia's leadership the group's performance
    was noticed by\nauthorities. For their assistance in quelling the uprising, the
    Caldari\nNavy offered Mordu and other leaders of the mercenary group\nreinstatement
    and official position within the Navy. Muryia and his men\ndeclined, instead announcing
    that Mordu's Legion were now freelance\nmilitary contractors.\n\n### Recruitment
    and Allegiance\n\nWhile Mordu made it known that the Legion would accept all races,
    he\nalso went to great lengths to make it know that he was not interested in\nwelcoming
    navy rejects, green recruits, disciplinary issues, enemies of\nthe state or people
    of questionable morals. To accept his amnesty was to\nreject your allegiance to
    your past political constraints. Trespassers,\nspies, and would-be vigilantes
    looking to settle old scores were\nexecuted by firing squad and sent back to their
    respective nations in\nflag-draped caskets. Muryia only wanted the best trained,
    most\ndisciplined and most honest. He made it a habit of meeting with every\nrecruit
    personally, if not overseeing their initial interview himself.\n\nFor a time,
    Mordu gained a reputation for poaching members of the\n[Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN)
    who had come to particular attention, such as battle-tested\nTurek Mayon and logistical
    genius and rising star Teston Hrinz. Both men\nencountered Muryia Mordu shortly
    before they were about to receive\nsignificant promotions, Hrinz aboard his shuttle
    while enroute and Mayon\nat a bar in the Caldari Navy Assembly Plant in Perimeter
    while he was\nwaiting to be seen.\n\nDespite it straining relations in some quarters,
    Mordu always maintained\nclose ties with the Caldari State, and long-standing
    members of the Legion who retired where offered Caldari\ncitizenship upon retirement.
    The Legion also gained access to high-end\nCaldari military gear, as well as frequent
    contracts from both military\nand corporate quarters.\n\nWhile Mordu demonstrated
    clear allegiance to his parent corporation, he\nfrequently accepted work from
    all the megacorporations, though with some\npreferential treatment. He was known
    to be accepting a great deal of\ncontracts from [Kaalakiota](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK),
    for example, both before and after the\nousting and exile of once-CEO [Haatakan
    Oiritsuu](4IoWYbA7pgLuUu5fqlCVxs), whom he was known to have a\nparticularly fiery
    love-hate relationship. It has been rumored that his\nson Arian, himself a member
    of the Legion, was the product of a union\nwith her, but this has never been substantiated.
    It's more likely that\nhe is one of the reasons their relationship grew to be
    so bitter.\n\n### Becoming a Capsuleer\n\nMordu was cloned shortly after the creation
    of the transneural burn\nscanner interface after being approached directly by
    [Otro Gariushi](5QydCJCoYvbvbWvFlAlbHg)\nin YC104. Despite concerns about his
    advanced age and the transplantation of his consciousness into a\nyounger clone
    body, through force of will, the application of wealth,\nand the gracious cooperation
    of Ishukone scientists, the procedure was a\nsuccess.\n\nIt has been noted that
    Mordu's cloning resulted in an increase in his\neccentricity and peculiar brand
    of humor. Said to be connected to\ncomplications that arose as a result of his
    advanced age at the time, he\nhas himself dismissed any concerns as to his behaviour
    as a result of a\nnew lease on life he had gained. Always a man who believed in
    integrity\nand speaking one's mind, Muryia notably became even more expressive,\noccasionally
    offensively so. He also started wearing more garish attire,\nincluding a wide
    variety of hats. Allies in the Legion would attest that\nthis was to cover up
    his custom implants, which featured prominently\nalong the sides of his scalp
    and behind the ear. There were suggestions\nthat his costuming was instead the
    clearest symptom of irregularities in\nhis behavior, alongside an increasingly
    blacker, warped sense of humor\nand a tendency to refer to conversations he'd
    had with those that he'd\nmurdered, even long after their deaths.\n\nMordu's cloning
    was ultimately justified as his being an asset to the\nCaldari cause and a chance
    to experiment with the cloning of a\nsignificantly older subject. It became clear,
    however, that a deal had\nbeen made between the CEO of Ishukone, once a member
    of the Guristas,\nand Muryia Mordu. In the years leading up to the death of Otro
    Gariushi\nin YC110 Mordu's Legion performed several key operations against assets\nof
    the hated Guristas. Based on intelligence provided by the Ishukone\nCEO, these
    precision strikes were led by a much more youthful figure who\nthe Legion still
    referred to as 'the old man'. Subsequent recruits to\nthe Legion assumed that
    this title was a reference to Mordu's\npatriarchal concern for his men.\n\n###
    Contract lost with ORE\n\nIn YC 106 Orion Mashel, the reclusive CEO of [Outer
    Ring Excavations](vtyIqELC7ngvFuWla7baP),\nhad a personal and heated meeting with\nMuryia
    Mordu, which resulted in the mercenary commander storming out.\nMashel's reputation
    as a recluse meant that this visit to his\nheadquarters attracted media attention,
    as well as the eyes of New Eden.\n Several days later, Mordu's Legion was seen
    mobilizing on a large\nscale, reportedly under the direct command of Muryia Mordu
    himself.\nThe taskforce then penetrated deep into Serpentis Corporation\nspace,
    avoiding all conflict with Serpentis forces as they orbited an installation in
    the\nheart of their territory and utilized an unknown device against a\nchemical
    storage facility. They then promptly left without any\ndamage to their own assets,
    and were pursued by Guardian Angel\nforces responding to the incursion.\nSeveral
    Legion ships were reported destroyed in skirmishes that followed\ndespite Mordu
    himself and the bulk of his fleet returned to headquarters\nunharmed. In an emergency
    meeting that followed, Mordu organized\ndefensive pickets around ORE facilities
    to safeguard against further\nretaliation by Serpentis and their [Angel Cartel](23YuvVn4HtUfRW2gAAn9mA)
    backed forces. Many other Legion forces\nwere left marauding in the Fountain region,
    proving to be a thorn in the side of the Serpentis. A week later the Serpentis
    and Cartel forces began a campaign to push the Legion forces\nout of Fountain,
    which eventually succeeded as Mordu yielded the field. The Legion's actions unsettled
    many factions including several prominent capsuleer alliances, all of whom publicly
    demanded answers\nfrom the mercenary group. Mordu, not being a man who appreciates
    having\nhis motives questioned, gave none.\n\nFollowing this, tensions clearly
    rose between the Legion and ORE,\nleading to the opinion that the incursion into
    Serpentis space was\nagainst the wishes of Mashel, or that Mordu himself opposed
    the campaign\nand was pressured by ORE. [Serpentis](3igWGHqQJXyJoUnM2XgGJC) capitalized
    on the souring\nrelationship and announced their buyout of large portions of ORE
    shares,\neven as as reports of a hostile annexing of 4C-B7X filtered out despite\na
    communications blackout. Both the buyout and the events of what\nsome referred
    to as the \"Serpent's Massacre\" put the Serpentis\nCorporation in a position
    of control over ORE policy, likely\ncontributing to the decision to revoke the
    Mordu's Legion contract for\nprotection. In exchange this buyout secured ORE assets
    against further\nhostile interference from Serpentis and their allies among the
    Angel\nCartel.\n\n### Intaki Prime and Ishukone\n\nFollowing Caldari occupation
    of the Gallente systems, designated as a\ncontested zone under the [CONCORD Emergency
    Militia War Powers Act](39y03QDhd4N8GXwoV2zSha), in YC111 the Caldari Providence
    Directorate held a blind\nauction for the administration and development rights
    to the systems\nunder their control. [Intaki](17xNygfKnuI4d0t0JHAU0Z) was the\nonly
    system awarded to the Ishukone Corporation. In a deal with the\nMordu's Legion
    and the Intaki Assembly, both corporations moved in to\nprovide security and commercial
    shipping services to the planet's\ngoverning authority.\n\nThis was revealed to
    be a mutual business deal between Ishukone, the\nLegion and the Intaki Assembly,
    who retained rights under Gallente laws\nto [franchise](7nwbW8LIvwRIDCFoi2E6vX)
    both services as they saw fit. Muryia Mordu had\nleveraged his close ties with
    both partners, and while security had been\ntraditionally handled by the Federation
    Navy,\nin March YC112 the Legion arrived in\nthe system with Ishukone commercial
    ships, who themselves had taken\nover commercial shipping from [FedMart](2Aa82GwowUlH7gWR8uItZU).
    Despite the\nauction results having been announced the previous year, until this\npoint
    no movement had transpired on Ishukone's part. Furthermore, the\nsystem control
    had been retaken by the Federal Defense\nUnion militia a week previous. The\nFDU
    were spurred to action over the reports and large conflicts took\nplace over the
    contested planet. This was followed by a plea from the\nIntaki Assembly for a
    cease fire, directed at the FDU, as they declared\nboth corporations to be \"present
    in Intaki at the specific and\nun-coerced request of the Assembly.\" Later that
    day the\nFederation Navy attempted to reassert control over the system by sending\na
    fleet under the control of Admiral Gouenette. The fleet was refused\nentry at
    the Intaki stargate in Agoze, and\nthe Intaki System Command informed the admiral
    they were \"neither\nrequired nor welcomed.\" While Ishukone are prohibited from
    sending\nany armed military ships to operate in Intaki, the Mordu's Legion are\ngiven
    full authority to police the local space and were given full\nmilitary access,
    subject to civilian oversight by the Intaki Assembly.\nAll of the negotiations
    involving the Legion in this deal where attended\nby Muryia Mordu himself, and
    there has been a great deal of speculation\nas to how many of the meetings that
    took place where done in back rooms\nrather than minuted board rooms subject to
    official oversight.\n\n### Battle of Pike's Landing\n\nMuryia Mordu was personally
    involved in the conflict that occurred in\nAmamake, in Heimatar, centered around
    the Pike's Landing battlefield on\nthe temperate planetary surface. A large element
    of Mordu's Legion\nforces jumped into orbit around his Wyvern-class supercarrier,
    all\nwithin close proximity to the Amarr fleet that had infiltrated the\nsystem.
    Collisions occurred as well as losses when an Avatar-class Titan\nfired it's doomsday
    weapon, obliterating several Mordu's Legion\ninterceptors as it attacked a Republic
    Fleet carrier.\n\nWhile the exact motives of the Amarr, Gallente and Caldari fleet\nelements
    under the leadership of Mens Reppola that were present in the\nfray have not been
    made publicly available, it is clear that Pike's\nLanding was the common reason
    for their aggressive presence in Republic\nterritory. Witnesses testify to furious
    fighting on the surface, and the\npresence of ships with the markings of Mordu's
    Legion. CONCORD is still\ninvestigating, but it has been suggested that the battle
    was connected\nto the development of cloned soldiers, particularly in light of
    Mordu's\nsubsequent connection with the activities of cloned mercenaries\nalongside
    those fighting for the empires across New Eden. \n\n### Mordu's Private Trials
    and Challenge\n\nIn YC114, before the purges that were to eventually happen in
    the\nsubsequent year, Muryia Mordu issued a series of challenges for cloned\nmercenaries.
    It became apparent that he had seen this new technology in\noperation in private
    trials and had been doing so since he had provided\nsanctuary to the first cloned
    soldier, who went rogue and broke away\nfrom his Amarr overlords. Mordu only confirmed
    that he had been privy to\nreports that detailed how cost effective and efficient
    they were proving\nfor the empires developing the technology in a public statement,
    also\nstating that he wanted to see their results in action for himself. As\nthese
    troops started entering into the freelance marketplace, setting up\nmercenary
    companies of their own and breaking away from the empires,\nMordu challenged them
    to prove that \"they're even one-tenth as good as\nmy guys...\"\n\n> The Legion
    has plenty of surveillance equipment and we're pretty well\n> tapped in to the
    goings on in public mercenary contracts. I'm going to\n> release a list of challenges...(L)et's
    see what these cloned mercs can\n> do.\n\nAware that scores of independents who
    are willing and able to die and\ndie again presented a threat to the Legion's
    standing, it was clear that\nthe challenge was a way to both test them and incite
    infighting amongst\nthe new outfits. It worked. Mordu backed up his promises with
    weapons,\ndropsuits, and equipment for the clone soldiers, who launched into\npublic
    contracts in direct opposition to each other. Their exchanges not\nonly demonstrated
    the power of the new order, but the violence they were\ncapable of that would
    later result in their condemnation, most notably\nby Gallente President Jacus
    Roden.\n\n### Events on Caldari Prime\n\nFollowing the events of Operation Highlander,
    a concerted effort by the\nGallente Federation to retake [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i)\nfrom
    the Caldari State, the planet was declared\na demilitarized zone in a treaty by
    both sides. Following the\ndestruction on the planet during the conflict, caused
    mostly by the\nremains of the Leviathan class *Shiigeru* titan crashing to the
    surface,\nthe administration of the planet was divided into two\ndistricts, Gallente
    and Caldari controlled. Soon afterwards, Muryia\nMordu issued a statement announcing
    that Mordu's Legion had been\nappointed as planetary security.\n\n> Ishukone and
    Material Acquisitions will remain in firm control of the\n> Caldari and Gallente
    districts, respectively. We will provide regular,\n> full reports to both them,
    the Chief Executive Panel, and Gallente\n> Senate in order to preserve transparency
    and ensure we are providing\n> fair and neutral oversight of the planet.\n\nFrom
    their appointment as security the Legion received praise from both\nadministrations
    for their handling of the civilian populace. While\ncomplaints against the Legion
    have been made for some instances of\nheavy-handedness, overall no major incidents
    have arisen. Documented\ncases of the Legion successfully calming or neutralizing
    outbreaks of\nviolence state they have been both effective, and even-handed in
    their\nduties. Muryia Mordu would not have had it any other way.\n\n### Recent
    Events\n\nAs testament to the calibre of the research and development that those\nunder
    his command have been conducting, CONCORD announced in YC 116 that\nthree new
    ships had been registered for deployment by Mordu's Legion: A\nfrigate class,
    the Garmur; a cruiser class, the Orthus; and a battleship\nclass, the Barghest.
    Disclosed statistics for the ships displayed a\npreference for advanced missile
    technology and long range warp drive\ndisruption, seemingly derived from both
    Caldari and Gallente technology.\nTestament to Mordu's policy of leaving allegiances
    to political powers\nbehind, these ships have been designed to serve a professional\npeace-keeping
    force that has served to bridge the gap between Gallente\nand Caldari on more
    than one occasion. It was later revealed that the\nLegion had acquired the use
    of one of Ishukone's think-tanks,\nKiiragustektaa, to help design a new ship,
    fitting to the needs of the\nLegion in their new role in Intaki in particular.
    Muryia Mordu's\nreputation as a keen negotiator and increasingly neutral intermediary\nare
    now evidenced by military assets born of cooperation and a desire\nfor security
    rather than simple superiority in protracted conflict.\n\nIt's also no surprise
    that Mordu's reputation, as well as the recent\nactions of his Legion, have led
    to a swelling of his ranks. Their rapid\nresponse and clear willingness to get
    involved has earned them plenty of\nadditional friends within the Caldari Navy
    and Megacorporation security forces.\nRecruitment activity is at an all time high
    as the Legion has been\nactively seen seeking new recruits among the disaffected
    soldiers in the\ncurrent warzones. Fuelled by the recent turmoil following the
    dissolving\nof the Caldari Providence Directorate and Tibus Heth's regime, many\nCaldari
    soldiers have taken to joining the Legion, and Gallente military\npersonnel who
    witnessed Mordu's Legion operate on Caldari Prime are also\nseeking to be led
    by Muryia Mordu.\n\n### See Also\n\n-   [Mordu's Legion](5csCeDqUe1exvVyfPdL75Q)\n-
