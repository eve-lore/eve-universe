- body: '**Frazov** was an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) with a military background
    marked by tattoos across his chest. He is considered to be an efficient sadist.
    When challenged by [Adron Srif](6qTwcVx73ngdPyee2fF5Lz) , he is believed to be
    the first to interpret the "no firearms" rule of the rite as permitting ranged
    weapons, which he used against Srif. When trapped, he revealed a fire-arm hidden
    in his prosthetic arm and killed Srif. He was then killed for breaking the rules
    of the rite.
