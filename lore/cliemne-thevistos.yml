- body: '**Cliemne Thevistos** is the daughter of [Ziather](rVmEewsC6fvvI0zQtjtBR)
    and sister of [Kestor](3q6R3yjJZoc7F8l2JFNPWh). She aspires to become a dancer
    with the hope the talent will bring a new quality of life for her, and attends
    the Shishaan Center for the Performing Arts to pursue this goal.


    As a girl, Cliemne had dreams which she then considered nightmares. They consisted
    of colorless vistas and a cold, gray sky which she would float away in. These
    dreams would leave her pale and sweating once awake, and consumed by a tremendous
    sense of loss and terror. Years later, after Cliemne had grown up, the dreams
    suddenly returned, but this time they were joyful, bright and warm, and filled
    her with a sense of soaring off to a happier place where she would be welcomed
    into loving arms, such as those of a mother she had never known. Cliemne''s instincts
    tell her these dreams and her dancing are intricately connected.
