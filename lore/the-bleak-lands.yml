    the region with all their fury and rage, forcing the Blood Raiders to retreat
    out of the Bleak Lands. Their presence is still felt, as the region remains a
    lawless danger to even the most wary traveler.\n\nRecent times have pushed this
    traditionally neglected region once more back into a position of some prominence.
    The brief War of Defiance was fought almost entirely within this region, and the
    ripples of that conflict and its fiery conclusion are still spreading. Many see
    the Bleaks as a central battlefield in the oft-predicted conflagration between
    the Empire and its former slaves, ensuring that some at least still have serious
    plans for the volume.\n\n\n### See Also \n* [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)\n*
