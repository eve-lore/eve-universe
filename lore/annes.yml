    to the [Minmatar Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) following the Elder War on
    the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo).


    At one point he visited a bar where he met [Sispur](61wTpOF3caRsctnEDDzVRa) and
    [Triat](331ej8qexWhiEiFsLNZJuF). Annes examined his position as a member of the
    "lost tribe" of Minmatar and how his tribe''s miraculous survival and return to
    the Republic had impacted him personally. He noted that prior to their rescue,
    they had no identity and now they had one thrust upon them suddenly. He related
    a story where a woman had sex with him simply because he was a Starkmanir and
    noted that the populace at large viewed him as a sign of hope. He eventually decided
    that the Starkmanir were a part of the Republic that were essential and that there
    was no other place for him beside the Republic.
