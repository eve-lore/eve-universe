- body: '**Keral** is the cloned son of [Bethora](5wsvjWAtEn3fgbxYCq7eG3). He is a

    member of the [Ardishapur Family](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO) and thus

    a part of [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) [royalty](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh).


    Parental pressure

    -----------------


    His unnamed father constantly pressured Keral to succeed in his studies,

    though Keral did not show much talent for them and constantly fell

    behind. After his father died, Bethora took up the task of pushing him

    to achieve bigger and better things.


    The race

    --------


    At her behest, he participated in a [spaceship race](2ryywB98oyDuraCpSPpxqE) where
    the goal was to destroy and

    retrieve beacons in an asteroid field. His second was

    Selan, the son of Raana.


    The race was meant to test leadership skills, and was thus done in a

    standard frigate rather than a pod-piloted

    ship. Perhaps at Bethora''s insistence, Keral fitted his ship with

    prototype rigs which were illegal and

    untested. The ship did well in the race, but as it neared the finish

    several systems malfunctioned, causing it to fly out of control and

    crash into a beacon. The crash killed Selan and fatally wounded Keral.


    Illegal cloning

    ---------------


    Bethora, unwilling to lose her son, ordered the doctors to clone Keral

    despite the [Scriptural](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp) doctrine of [Sacred Flesh](3k3re1JeaMxvvTRz3qARFv)
    forbidding royals Amarr flesh from being

    cloned. The [cloning](5y5CUyA9h4xXY40dInhn3o) went awry because of the lack

    of proper procedures, leaving Keral with extreme brain damage. He was

    reduced to shouting out phrases from movies, tossing things around,

    spinning in place, and shutting the lights on and off at random.
