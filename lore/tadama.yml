    show and renounce his faith on air, Tadama urged him to do so. When

    Cherall told her that his partner of thirty years,

    [Samne](1f0aCFFod3nVVVcvDYL7cQ), had been kidnapped and murdered by the same

    group, she realized that Cherall did not plan on acquiescing to their

    demands. Despite being warned about going to the police, she vowed to do
