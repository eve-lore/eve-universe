- body: '**Quafe+** was a regional soft drink in development by [Quafe Company](ssPYMESgTyz1rl4fTojD6)
    under the direction of Gheyr Aillon.

    The drink was extremely addictive because of its flavoring agents, which

    were created by [Simuel Touvoux](5JMmpSbMGNrKtgkCvBoMe) using

    biomass. The agent caused product demand in testing areas to rise by

    300% within 12 hours of consumption. However, once it was discovered

    that the biomass used in the flavoring agent was created from human

    remains recovered by Lost Stars, Inc, production was halted immediately.
