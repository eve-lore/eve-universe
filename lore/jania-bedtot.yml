    Life at Outpost 4972

    --------------------


    Jania was a colleague of [Szekel](2KLlyAO4njOMOllcdmqgtv), a fellow

    researcher. When an asteroid landed on the planet and was found to

    contain archaea that interacted with the metal in the asteroid, she and

    Szekel began researching it heavily. [Rakan Dep](1mJatucCrGapiHxzZQna6Y)

    believed the two began an affair during their time in the labs. When

    Szekel absconded with the data, Jania came under investigation by

    corporate police. Though she denied involvement, she was ruthlessly

    interrogated. The police eventually turned to torture and Jania

    expressed extreme distress. She admitted to nothing, but eventually

    agreed to call her husband to the planet, while begging for her daughter

    to be left out of the entire event.
