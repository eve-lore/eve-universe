- body: '**Girani-Fa** is a mineral-rich system located close to the borders of both
    the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) and [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
    empires.


    Once disputed territory between the two empires, the system remains under Amarr
    sovereignty, with the Gallente having rights to mine there as long as they sell
    a fixed amount of minerals to the Amarrians each year at cost price.


    The Amarr Empire established a defense complex and industrial works on the planet
    of Girani-Fa III some years after the Treaty of Girani-Fa was signed.
