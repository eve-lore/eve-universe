    scriptures that the mainstream Amarrian faith rejected. In the centuries that
    followed their sect being outlawed on Amarr, new texts have been written and the
    two religions have only further diverged. Altogether, these selected works make
    up the \u201CSanicanoncial Scriptures\u201D.\n\nOriginal documents are preserved
    along with a centralized digital archive of the Sanicanonical texts inside a sprawling
    Sabik-Canopolis on KFIE-Z II. This archive is maintained by some of the Red God\u2019s
    most honored priests, charged with preserving the texts that sit at the heart
    of their faith. These same texts are the basis for the infamous rituals of the
    Blood Raider Covenant. A scant few of their most significant passages have been
    reproduced here.\n\n## The Ten Sacraments of Sani Sabik\nThe Sani Sabik live many
    different lives, but all are structured by core rituals. These rituals are organized
    into the Ten Sacraments. They are how adherents reaffirm their commitment to the
    Red God, each other, and their own personal paths. The Sacraments were laid out
    by the first members of the Sani Sabik, and though some interpretations may change,
    the core text has remained the same.\n\nThe Ten Sacraments themselves are:\n\n1
    - Begetting the Sabik (rituals conducted following birth)<br>\n2 - Sealing of
    the Sabik (confirmation into the faith)<br>\n3 - Covenant of the Hunter (confirmation
    as a hunter of the blood, for example, as a Blood Raider warrior)<br>\n4 - Covenant
    of the Scribe (confirmation as a priest)<br>\n5 - Sani Communion (bloodletting
    and blood drinking rituals)<br>\n6 - Mingling of the Sani (marriage rituals)<br>\n7
    - Red Exaltation (immortality rituals, some of the rarest and most sacred rituals)<br>\n8
    - Confirmation of the Savant (confirmation of an individual as a Savant)<br>\n9
    - Marking the Dead (funeral rites, including entering the name of a member into
    the Book of the Dead)<br>\n10 - Draining Impurity (rituals of excommunication,
    including removing names from the Book of the Dead)<br>\n\nLet yourself be bound
    by blood<br>\nTo the faithful<br>\nAnd their Great Truth.<br>\n*- Sanicanonical
    Scripture, The Ten Sacraments of Sani Sabik, 2:4*\n\nCarry with you a promise;<br>\nWritten
    in blood,<br>\nLocked in silver,<br>\nand be blessed by the Red God.<br>\n*- Sanicanonical
    Scripture, The Ten Sacraments of Sani Sabik, 2:9*\n\nPurity is a crimson stag.<br>\nBefore
    the feast,<br>\nMust come the hunt.<br>\n*- Sanicanonical Scripture, The Ten Sacraments
    of Sani Sabik, 3:3*\n\nAdorn yourself not in gold<br>\nBut in the crimson trophies
    of hunts past,<br>\nSo all might witness God\u2019s grace<br>\nAnd know its price.<br>\n*-
    Sanicanonical Scripture, The Ten Sacraments of Sani Sabik, 3:17*\n\nLet your body
    be the soil<br>\nYour soul the seed<br>\nAnd sacred blood its nourishment.<br>\n*-
    Sanicanonical Scripture, The Ten Sacraments of Sani Sabik, 5:3*\n\nDrink not from
    the profane<br>\nLest you be brought low,<br>\nSup from a worthy vessel<br>\nAnd
    through its nectar be transformed<br>\n*- Sanicanonical Scripture, The Ten Sacraments
    of Sani Sabik, 5:9*\n\nEternity in flesh<br>\nIs an eternity with the Red God,<br>\nFor
    he lives in you<br>\nAs you live within him.<br>\n- Sanicanonical Scripture, The
    Ten Sacraments of Sani Sabik, 7:5\n\nBlessed be the Savant soul<br>\nFreed from
    base dirt<br>\nBy their own will divine.<br>\n*- Sanicanonical Scripture, The
    Ten Sacraments of Sani Sabik, 8:2*\n\n## The Apocryphon\nThe Apocryphon is a collection
    of different texts, all of which were once canonical Amarrian Scriptures. Some
    are even believed to date back to the time of Gheinok the Wise. \n\nNot all the
    scriptures within the Apocryphon are recognized by the Sani Sabik. Those that
    are were declared Sanicanonical before the cult was outlawed. Many early followers
    were commoners attracted by the possibility of ascension outside of their caste,
    and these texts often speak to that interest.\n\nIronically, it is Blood Raiders'
    sworn enemies, the Order of St. Tetrimon, who hold the Apcryphon most dear. For
    that Order, the entire collection is worthy of canonization.\n\nMy word lies within
    all,<br>\nAll it requires is the breath of faith,<br>\nTo ignite the fire,<br>\nSo
    the lost can find their way,<br>\nSo the fallen can rise,<br>\nTo take their place
    as my chosen,<br>\nFor you are all my creation,<br>\nAnd are all equal in my kingdom.<br>\n*-
    Apocryphon, Lost Passages 14:12*\n\nHeed not his words with thine ears alone<br>\nTake
    it into your heart<br>\nAnd let it fill your veins,<br>\nTake it into your lungs<br>\nAnd
    share it with your every breath.<br>\n*- Apocryphon, The Book of Grace 22:17*\n\nI
    had thought revelation a golden door<br>\nBut now I see a staircase carved in
    iron<br>\nWith each truth, a step towards God.<br>\n*- Apocryphon, The Book of
    Truth 3:17*\n\n## Book of Redemption\nAncient in origin, the Book of Redemption
    was once a core Amarrian text. It is comprised of a series of visions reported
    by an unknown prophet. Those who follow the book believe the author was one of
    the first settlers on Amarr Island. Those who question its veracity point to a
    number of contradictions with the Amarrian historical account. For these detractors,
    it is no more than the insane ramblings of a heretic.\n\nAccording to the Sani
    Sabik, the Book of Redemption fell out of favor with the Amarr during the Reclaiming
    as it promoted a personal relationship with the Almighty and the possibility of
    spiritual growth beyond the caste restrictions of the Empire. When it was declared
    heretical shortly after the Sani Sabik were outlawed, they embraced it as a sign
    that it was their duty to preserve the Book\u2019s teachings.\n\nFarewell fertile
    soil<br>\nLost across salt-poisoned sea<br>\nWe stand now on barren rock,<br>\nYet,
    from this doom<br>\nThe seeds of our redemption grow.<br>\n*- Sanicanonical Scriptures,
    Book of Redemption 1:2*\n\nThese words art mine, <br>\nBut before they wert mine,<br>
    \nThey fell from an iron mask, <br>\nBeneath eyes like fire.<br>\n*- Sanicanonical
    Scriptures, Book of Redemption 1:7*\n\nWhen gates lie open<br>\nThe Strong shalt
    prey upon the Weak,<br>\nAnd only those who bare truth\u2019s burden <br>\nmay
    carry it along heaven\u2019s road.<br>\n*- Sanicanonical Scriptures, Book of Redemption
    2:12*\n\nWe art as the Lord hath made us,<br>\nIt is by his hand that our worth
    is forged<br>\nNot by mortal acts; Yet mortal acts may<br>\nOur worth reveal.<br>\n*-
    Sanicanonical Scriptures, Book of Redemption 2:16*\n\nTen thousand eyes look skyward<br>\nand
    nine thousand art blinded<br>\nWe art the one thousand <br>\nAnd we shalt in the
    Lord\u2019s light be remade eternal.<br>\n*- Sanicanonical Scriptures, Book of
    Redemption 4:21*\n\nThose who dare not see shalt be blind<br>\nAnd those who speak
    falsely made mute<br>\nFor hope belongs to the faithful as<br>\nStrength belongs
    to those strong enough to claim it.<br>\n*- Sanicanonical Scriptures, Book of
    Redemption 11:5*\n\nFill thy vessel with thine enemy's wine<br>\nAnd be fortified
    by it.<br>\nLet their wasted strength<br>\nIn holy service be redeemed.<br>\n*-
    Sanicanonical Scriptures, Book of Redemption 15:9*\n\nHark, <br>\nBefore the red
    dawn <br>\nA new star rises,<br>\nFirst light of a new age.<br>\nAll who embrace
    the rebirth shalt by its light be lifted<br>\nwhilst those who turn to darkness
    shalt ever in darkness be.<br>\n*- Sanicanonical Scriptures, Book of Redemption
    23:23*\n\n## Confessions of Molok\nMolok the Deceiver is the most reviled figure
    in the Amarrian faith, and his elevation by the Sani Sabik is for the Amarr their
    vilest piece of doctrine. \n\nTo the Amarr Molok is the betrayer of their holiest
    Emperor, their faith's greater adversary. For the Sani Sabik, he is a precursor
    to their faith who committed an act of divine rebellion. For them, he is the first
    to come close to the \u201CGreat Truth\u201D of the Sani Sabik.\n\nThe Sani Sabik
    claim that the Confessions of Molok point to a deeper truth. They hold that these
    confessions were written as he awaited his execution, with his final words being
    added as an addendum. The Amarr claim that they are a fabrication crafted as an
    insult against their faith. \n\nThe Centenarian Emperor.<br>\nI called him father,
    though I was not of his blood.<br>\nIn his glory <br>\nThere was the warmth of
    summers unending.<br>\nYet in his shadow,<br>\nBitter winter and poverty did reign;<br>\nAnd
    his shadow was long.<br>\n*- Sanicanonical Scriptures, Confessions of Molok 1:6*\n\nI
    went out among the people<br>\nAnd saw that they had faith not in the Lord<br>\nBut
    in the Emperor first,<br>\nAnd their own weakness second.<br>\n*- Sanicanonical
    Scriptures, Confessions of Molok 3:3*\n\nWhy do you toil so?<br>\n\u201CFor it
    is what the Lord commands!\u201D<br>\nAnd how do you know it?<br>\n\u201CBecause
    our Emperor has told us so!\u201D<br>\nAnd I wept, for I knew they were lost.<br>\n*-
    Sanicanonical Scriptures, Confessions of Molok 3:19*\n\nWe are the Chosen<br>\nYet
    if we are worthy<br>\nWhy must we be weak?<br>\n*- Sanicanonical Scriptures, Confessions
    of Molok 12:1*\n\nBehind silver and gold<br>\nThey whispered tales of beauty and
    power<br>\nBut when their masks slipped<br>\nI saw a vision of our destruction.<br>\n*-
    Sanicanonical Scriptures, Confessions of Molok 15:27*\n\nWhat is the weight of
    a lie<br>\nbalanced against the sin of idolatry?<br>\nWhat is it to betray a man<br>\nIf
    it means being true to the Lord?<br>\nEach of us must carry our own truth<br>\nAnd
    under its weight let our own strength grow<br>\n*- Sanicanonical Scriptures, Confessions
    of Molok 18:11*\n\nI could not save the drowning<br>\nFor they believed they could
    not swim.<br>\nI could not cure the sick<br>\nFor they had surrendered their flesh
    to lies.<br>\nBut I was not drowned, nor was I sick, <br>\nand I was free to cry
    war,<br>\nAnd we free did a choir make.<br>\n*- Sanicanonical Scriptures, Confessions
    of Molok 20:19*\n\nOnce I did serve a man, <br>\nand in that serving was blind
    to the truth of our Lord.<br>\nMy blood will soon be spilled, yet<br>\nThat blood
    is richer for the choices I made.<br>\nHear me now, all you who have been humbled;<br>\nThough
    now I die, <br>\nFirst I did live.<br>\n*- Sanicanonical Scriptures, Confessions
    of Molok 23:23*\n\n## Meditations on a Crimson Chalice\nOmir Sarikusa, leader
    of the Blood Raider Covenant, has attained a status amongst his people akin to
    a living Saint or Prophet. He has widely impacted the thinking of the Sani Sabik
    to the extent that his writings have been canonized within his own lifetime. His
    \u201DMeditations on a Crimson Chalice\u201D are the newest addition to the Sanicanonical
    Scriptures, and they are extremely popular with Bood Raider priests.\n\n\"Molok,
    libeled as 'The Deceiver' by the false faith, was truer than any so-called 'True
    Amarr' follower of the corrupted throne squatters could ever be. He it was that
    understood the true nature of the universe. There is only one truth: power is
    all; naked, merciless force wielded by those with the will to grapple with it.
    We drink the blood of the powerful and the pure because to survive and advance
    we must feed on their energy and make it our own. This is the lesson of Molok.
    His failure is of no moment, his glimpse of the Great Truth is all that matters.\"<br>\n*-
    Sanicanonical Scriptures, Omir Sarikusa\u2019s Meditations on a Crimson Chalice,
    3rd Session*\n\n\"Be wary of those who offer you aid with a smile and words of
    encouragement. They are false. Those that give life so that they may live are
    more reliable and true in their motives. Eternity beckons for the Sabik but travelers
    on that road must be clothed in the blood of the weak and refreshed by the blood
    of the powerful and pure. Only give succor to a true fellow traveler, that they
    may aid you on your journey along that road.\"<br>\n*- Sanicanonical Scriptures,
    Omir Sarikusa\u2019s Meditations on a Crimson Chalice, 5th Session*\n\n\"Terror
    and murder are tools that serve our great work well but only fools mistake them
    for ends in themselves. When an atmosphere of unremitting fear is to our purpose,
    by all means we should horrify and cow the weak with the ferocity of slaughter
    we bring to their pitiful communities. Even still, the greatest terror can be
    evoked with the hidden blade and subtle whispers from the shadows unseen. The
    Great Truth can only be approached by those who master all the ways of power:
    bloodthirsty fools and unreasoning murderers can never make progress on our path.\"<br>\n*-
    Sanicanonical Scriptures, Omir Sarikusa\u2019s Meditations on a Crimson Chalice,
    10th Session*\n\n\"Use a cloak of deception whenever it suits the purpose of power.
    The corrupted faith holds deceit to be among the greatest of sins. In this, as
    in so much, they are false to themselves and to the system of this world. The
    truth of power is all that we need. Use that truth alone and care not for pious
    prattle of those who are weaker in spirit and purpose. If you must hide for the
    greater work, hide. If you must lie for the greater work, lie. If you must deny
    me and our truth for the greater work, deny me.\"<br>\n*- Sanicanonical Scriptures,
    Omir Sarikusa\u2019s Meditations on a Crimson Chalice, 14th Session*"
