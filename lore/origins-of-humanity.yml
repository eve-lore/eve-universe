- body: "## Exodus\n\nIn the year AD 7987, roughly fifteen thousand years ago, the
    colonized universe was plagued with strife. Overpopulation and scarcity of natural
    resources had caused a great deal of conflict among the nations of humanity. It
    was against this backdrop that explorers on the astral frontier chanced to witness
    the opening of a natural wormhole. Not long after, compelled by their dire circumstances,
    a team of scientists and specialists from several nations mounted the first manned
    expedition through the portal. On the other side, several habitable worlds lay
    ripe for the taking.\n\nWithin a few years, all of humankind\u2019s spacefaring
    nations had sent settlers through the wormhole. The site itself caught on with
    the public, quickly acquiring an aura of myth and wonder in popular culture. Upon
    his return from the first voyage, the leader of the pioneering research team gave
    a speech in which he proclaimed humanity to be \u201Con the eve of a second genesis.\u201D
    From then on, the gate would be known as [EVE](2z1KQXUVtPP1WmlwcJaX4o).\n\nA small,
    fervently religious sect known as the Conformists was among the first of the independent
    settler teams to venture through. In a historic interview, their leader, Dano
    Gheinok, christened the system beyond the wormhole \u201CNew Eden.\u201D The system\u2019s
    official name was CMS-48, but Gheinok\u2019s moniker captured the imagination
    of the common man. Today, the name refers to the entire [cluster of stars](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk)
    beyond the wormhole.\n\nIn the decades that followed, mass colonization took place
    in New Eden. Gigantic construction ships sailed light years toward uncharted stars,
    where they constructed star gates so their smaller brethren might follow. For
    three generations, humanity spread far and wide within this new star cluster,
    flourishing within the virgin territories. Technology and industry prospered,
    and the sprouts of new culture began to grow in the burgeoning territories. Just
    as it seemed humanity was on the cusp of a brighter future, disaster struck.\n\n![Colonization

- body: "## Paradise Lost\n\nOn the twentieth of February in the year AD 8061, seventy-two
    years after it was first glimpsed by eager eyes, the New Eden sun bore witness
    to one of the greatest catastrophes in the history of mankind. Shortly after midnight,
    making a routine run around the perimeter of the EVE Gate, a patrol ship reported
    strange phenomena surrounding the wormhole. Small pockets of gravitational fluctuation
    buffeted the ship, while its sensor systems and navigational equipment suffered
    sporadic interference. \n\nNot long afterward, a deafening hiss overtook the communications
    channels of every ship in the immediate vicinity. As the hiss grew to a pitched
    scream, the gravitational forces around the wormhole began to swirl toward a single
    point. Seconds later, a cataclysmic blast of energy spiraled out from the tunnel,
    annihilating everything in its path.\n\nGradually, colonists discovered that the
    star gates connecting their territories with the New Eden system had all suffered
    strange electrical malfunctions. Colony leaders on the frontier immediately ordered
    scouts back to investigate. When the first of these made their way back to the
    site of the wormhole, the true extent of the damage was revealed: the wormhole
    had collapsed upon itself, leaving only a dead singularity at its core."

- body: "## The Dark Ages\n\nAs panic spread among the newly isolated colonies, individual
    leaders used a number of methods to quell the unrest. Many of them instigated
    martial law, while others enacted social programs to assure their colonies\u2019
    sustainability. Despite good intentions, few of these colonies possessed the needed
    resources or infrastructure to be self-sufficient.\n\nIn the years that followed,
    rioting and civil war wracked the colonies. Conflict and starvation claimed the
    lives of vital experts, who left no successors to their knowledge. Terraforming
    operations stopped dead in their tracks. Crucial equipment fell into disrepair,
    then ruin. Subsistence became the standard. Progress was rendered a distant dream.
    Separate worlds lost contact, and eventually their memories of each other vanished
    behind the veil of time. One by one, the majority of New Eden\u2019s fledgling
    colonies quietly marched into unhallowed extinction.\n\nAnd yet, a few resilient
    colonies managed to hang on, passing down basic trades from generation to generation.
    As decades turned to centuries and centuries to millennia, the shroud of legend
    fell over humankind\u2019s origin.\n\n![Colony Collapse](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/6umkxzeWsNcC0OvY1TXgeY/ffb6de1ff856e6f23f7e75b76d24a843/Origins1.png)"

- body: "## Rebirth\n\nGradually, colonies that shared the same planets came to find
    each other. Technologies crucial to space exploration were invented anew. New
    planets were settled and new star gates built, and over the span of several epochs\u2014through
    countless wars, pacts, treaties, trade agreements, and other deals of state\u2014five
    distinct civilizations emerged.\n\nThe [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
    are a vast theocracy supported by a broad foundation of slave labor, fully assured
    of their own position as the chosen children of their one true god. The [Caldari
    State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) are a militaristic corporate-run meritocracy who
    regard honor and duty to be the highest ideals one can aspire to. The [Gallente
    Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) is a nation of hedonistic libertines, compassionate
    and cunning in equal measure.\n\nThe [Minmatar Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp)
    is a tribal republic of warrior poets and artisans, fiercely proud and individualistic.
    The [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G) are a mysterious race of highly advanced genetic
    manipulators. After coming into contact with each other, these five civilizations
    founded a regulatory agency that would become an emblem of peace and cooperation
    between them. This institution was named [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt).\n\nThe
    world of New Eden today is a grim universe as well as a beautiful one, fraught
    with danger and rich with opportunity, torn by conflict and treachery. It is a
    world at a crossroads, where a dominant new breed of human being, effectively
    immortal, threatens to irrevocably upset the balance of power. Embroiled in constant
    economic and military conflict, these immortals fight for wealth and glory on
    the lawless boundaries of the universe, while the millennia-old empires try their
    best to carve out their own slices in the face of a rapidly emerging new world
    order."
