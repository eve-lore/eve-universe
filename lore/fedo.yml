    The fedo was discovered by the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) and has spread
    with the Empire and beyond due to its usefulness.\n\n\n### Historical Background\n
    Amarr settlers first discovered fedos deep in the caves of Palpis VI. They soon
    found use for these tame creatures as an efficient source of garbage disposal.
    It wasn't long before space-faring vessels adopted the fedo as well despite the
    its pungent odor. With the discovery of the fedo's ability to withstand vacuum
    conditions for several hours, and its ability to eliminate bacteria on board the
    ship itself, ship designers soon started replacing garbage disposal features with
    breeding and housing pens for fedos.\n\nOnly the males are used for cleaning,
    but with the fedo's short lifespan in captivity, females are also needed to replenish
    stocks. On Amarr vessels, the pens are usually tended to by slaves, and the fedos
    are herded to different parts of the ship at different times. The [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp)
    also make use of fedos, though on Minmatar ships, the males are simply allowed
    to roam freely.\n\nRecently, the fedo has begun to fill other niches in modern
    society as well, such as the growing popularity of [fedo fighting](5EvFnK9I9mRS8J8eAHJzjL)
    or its use in various genres of movie entertainment.\n\n\n### Distribution and
    Habitat\nThe fedo's original habitat was deep underground in the caverns of Palpis
    VI. On their own, the species never would have moved beyond these caverns.\n\n\n###
    Characteristics\nFedos are typically between 30-50 cm long and 20-40 cm high,
    although some larger specimens have been reported in the wild. It is an omnivorous,
    non-anthropod invertebrate most resembling a sponge. It has reddish skin punctuated
    by tiny, calciferous ridges on its back. Small, claw-like tentacles distributed
    around its body are used mainly for movement, though these can also serve as a
    limited form of defense. The female of the species has more of these tentacles,
    and is larger and richer in color than the male. The females also possess a tail
    approximately 10 centimeters long with a small opening at the end of this tail
    can emit highly toxic fumes.\n\nFedos have no eyes or ears, but are able to communicate
    by smell and vibration. The mouth of the fedo is a small opening on its underbelly
    that is lined with tiny rows or serrated cartilage,and it feeds by lowering its
    body over the morsels to be eaten. The digestive system of the fedo is highly
    inefficient, and the food will often rot well before it is digested, contributing
    to the creatures foul smell.\n\nWhile in its natural habitat fedos can live up
    to several decades, in captivity their life-span is typically only a few weeks.\n\n\n####
    Reproductive Traits\nFedos have no set mating season and do not share in the raising
    of the young. Typically, a male fedo will only mate with a single female in its
    lifetime, though the female will have many partners. Impregnated females will
    birth between 1 and 3 in a brood, but does so within 2 days of being fertilized.
    A female fedo can give birth twice a week.\n\nAll fedos are born with tails and
    do not exhibit qualities of either sex. They usually reach reproduction age within
    the first 24 hours, and this is when they develop gender characteristics. The
    first tail falls off, with only the females regrowing them.\n\n\n### See Also\n\n*
