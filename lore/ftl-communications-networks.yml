- body: '**FTL communications networks** are composed of numerous quantum-entangled

    [fluid routers](4w6FgQepyWkx0g0zXZctHM). The services and routers, albeit owned
    and

    run by independent companies, are under constant scrutiny and regulations by [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt)

    to enforce both security and privacy in the communications channels and

    to make sure the companies are correctly rendering the services they

    claim. The fierce competition on the telecommunication market makes it

    cheap, efficient and reliable to talk, transfer data, and even conduct

    business to people light-years apart. The Communications Relay

    Commission or Communications Relay Committee was previously in charge of

    the CONCORD scrutiny and directive enforcement in the FTL telecom

    business.
