    a religious fanatic. He was extremely conservative and xenophobic and

    valued traditions over everything else. He was not overtly militaristic,

    but rather more of an isolationist.


    Idonis was the son of [Arkon Ardishapur](17tWRlpXtkWqoUBdAdWGxN)

    and had moved with him to Ezzara VI to bring the

    [Scriptures](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp) to the

    [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp). While he and his friend Zoriac had

    belittled the Minmatar back home, they came to have an appreciation for

    their culture. Idonis even began a clandestine affair with a Starkmanir

    woman.


    When his father Arkon was murdered by [Drupar Maak](4jYB1gA3QgB54Pi5vxP3Em) during
    a slave revolt, Idonis''s first act

    to was to avenge this death with the destruction of all the

    [Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw) on Arzad II, bombarding them from

    orbit.


    He later issued the edict Khaderia''s Law, shortly after the discovery of

    Starkman Prime, or Arzad II. The edict, not widely publicized or even

    understood by Imperial lawyers-yet tacitly enforced nonetheless-states

    unconditionally that no further harm shall directly befall Arzad II.


    Idonis committed suicide at the end of the [Amarr Succession](1wt48mKlJG23uoZhpmxNzx)
    which saw [Doriam Kor-Azor](1aaBMbCysLA8uJjQQczFwT) rise to the throne.
