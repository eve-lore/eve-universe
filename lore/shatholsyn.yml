    following the election of a new\n[Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ). The tradition
    arose following\nthe [Moral Reforms](48nuiRGJ4i8BwACDI9a58u), in order to minimize
    the\nrisk of conflict between the new Emperor and his old rivals. The\ntradition
    has only twice been broken.\n\nOrigin\n------\n\nPrior to the Moral Reforms, the
    [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) Emperor was\nconsidered the first among equals
    on the [Council of Apostles](nTZLcvZprqLLUiGIaVQu7). The Emperor was more or less\na
    figurehead of power, chosen from among the Apostles by the other\nApostles, and
    in practice wielded essentially the same secular power as\nhis fellows. The Moral
    Reforms changed this, placing increasing\nreligious and secular powers in the
    hands of the Emperor, making him the\nundisputed leader of the Empire. The Privy
    Council, which replaced the function of the\nCouncil of Apostles, were subordinate
    to the Emperor and was composed of\nthe other claimants to the throne.\n\nIt was
    quickly realized that when the Emperor died, those claimants who\nlost out would
    pose a threat to the new Emperor's power. Supporters of\nthe losers might cry
    foul and oppose particulars of the selection\nprocess, or push their chosen to
    oppose the new Emperor. Opposition\nwould cause strife within the Empire at best,
    outright civil war at\nworst.\n\nMany solutions were proposed, but all had flaws.
    It was finally the head\nof the Ardishapur Family that proposed\nthe ritual suicide.
    Drawing on old and then-obscure\n[Scripture](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp), the suicide
    had a religious\nprecedent and would neatly solve all the problems. The losing
    claimants\nwould remove themselves entirely from the picture. Their deaths would\ngive
    the Emperor time to consolidate his power, much as the new Heirs\nwould be consolidating
    their own.\n\nThe Privy Council agreed that this drastic solution was the only
    way to\nensure that the Empire would not risk its own destruction with ever new\nEmperor.\n\nBreaks
    of Tradition\n-------------------\n\nShathol'Syn has only been broken twice. The
    first was by [Garkeh Khanid](5HlA8KgFOuLy4jTf3t54xf), the heir of the Khanid\nFamily,
    following the election of [Heideran Kador](4Olxc4nxWd7y1mjFPhvHnV) as Emperor.
    Garkeh had only recently\nbeen made the Heir of Khanid Family and was a young,
    ambitious man.\nA powerful Heir, he was considered the favorite to be elected
    Emperor.\nWhen he lost, he refused to commit suicide, stating, \n\n> I will not
    be ordered ... to destroy myself when my work is unfinished. You will\n> not take
    anything from me, ... least of all my life.\n\nInstead, Garkeh declared himself
    Khanid II, King of the [Khanid Kingdom](5VtgxEr1vnxuazt8lvQLoj), and seceded from
    the Empire. Though\nthis was the very thing Shathol'Syn was meant to avoid, little
    warfare\nbroke out, as Heideran VII and the new Heirs were busy strengthening\ntheir
    own positions, leaving them unable to counterattack. The Empire\ninvaded later,
    but by then the Kingdom had dug in, making it virtually\nimpossible to conquer.\n\nThe
    second time was in YC110, by [Jamyl Sarum](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L). Believed dead
    following her loss of the\n[Succession Trials](1wt48mKlJG23uoZhpmxNzx) to [Doriam
    Kor-Azor](1aaBMbCysLA8uJjQQczFwT) in YC105, Jamyl\nreturned from the dead to lead
    the Empire in defense of the invading\n[Elder Fleet](7JAFwYwGqzvPv7yLIDlfjp).
    Jamyl had appeared to commit\nsuicide following Doriam II's coronation, self-destructing
    her ship.\nBecause of the doctrine of [Sacred Flesh](3k3re1JeaMxvvTRz3qARFv),
    it\nwas forbidden for Jamyl to clone herself. The\nSarum Family declared her return
    a miracle,\nwhile her control of a mysterious super weapon and widespread popularity\nmade
    it difficult for others to challenge her. Eventually, she was\ncrowned Empress
    and cleared of wrongdoing by the Theology Council. There were still elements within\nthe
    Empire who believed Jamyl to be a heretic and false Empress, though\nthese kept
    their voices muffled for fear of reprisal.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n-   [The Amarr
