- body: '**Aduner Hulmkelat** is an elder [Minmatar](3VbZNIqcUMjhZ8dlSFN8f1) statesman
    and government official.


    At one point he and his fellow official, [Sadrede Svarg](3SX4vUKoA6WJlXGrb9vIDl),
    spent a few hours at the beach during a break in government negotiations. Together,
    they visited the sand sculptor [Elbrand Toudin](5RGi23lp6LgyLzQojxOa5N). Aduner
    watched from a pier above the proceedings, where he expressed dismay at the sculptures.
    He found the first, a chaotic figure with Minmatar faces for a body and Khumaaks
    for legs that were covered in tribal tattoos, to be needlessly inflammatory. He
    found a fire-breathing serpent to be both too real and unnervingly fake. And he
    thought it a waste of design and a crude joke when he found a stone castle that
    served merely as a facade to hide a mechanism that allowed a figure of a Minmatar
    boy to urinate on the head of an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo). He left with
    Sadrede and watched as his fellow berated a Ruhste dancer. Aduner considered that
    the dancer, in practicing an art that makes it appear he is only pretending to
    know how to inflict violence, was the one who was most likely able to inflict
    true violence without anyone realizing it.


    When the two men later met [Bryld](6Qjylht5emiCCaJVOY1ozM), a young boy playing
    with ChromIts, Aduner was the one to notice the boy used a less challenging technique
    and cheated with glue to make his sculpture.

    Despite the child''s young age, he grew frustrated, believing that he was only
    seeing illusions of promise and no actual potential. The two men then returned
    to their negotiations with [Karin Midular](3KxlNVAeglPj5ZH0sf3U2j).
