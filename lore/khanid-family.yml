    royal house. Once one of the [Five Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) families, the
    Khanid Heir rebelled following the election of [Heideran VII](4Olxc4nxWd7y1mjFPhvHnV)
    as [Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ), founding the [Khanid Kingdom](5VtgxEr1vnxuazt8lvQLoj).
    The current leader of the family, [Khanid II](5HlA8KgFOuLy4jTf3t54xf), is the
    King of the Khanid Kingdom. \n\nTraditionally, the Family ruled over the domains
    settled by the [Khanid](1IRIdXfOZrfl5BuFuabOh6) people. The Family takes its name
    from the bloodline, a move that has won them the continued loyalty of the Khanid
    people for thousands of years.\n\n\n### History\n#### Early Years\nThe Khanid
    Family, then known by a different name, was originally a noble house on [[Amarr
    Island]] during the early years of the [Reclaiming](70QLNGRwCwHUgmcjTmuhsA). The
    family was instrumental in bringing the Khanid people to the side of the Amarr.
    The head of the family acted as a diplomat to the scattered tribes, uniting them
    against their common foes the [Udorians](723tMHRDvyldo15RMLMuqh). \n\nThe assistance
    of the Khanid people was a major boon to the [Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo),
    giving them the martial prowess to assault the Udorians relentlessly. For their
    aide in bringing the Khanid to the Empire's side, the Emperor made the Family
    the stewards of the Khanid lands and people. In a sense, the Khanid people forced
    the Empire's hand, as they remained warlike and difficult to control.\n\nThe family,
    seeing the power to be gained by making the Khanid people friends, renamed themselves
    in honor of the Khanid people. This proved to be a very savvy move, earning the
    loyalty of the Khanid people and tying the family with the bloodline.\n\n\n####
    Expansion\nWhen the Empire began its conquest of space, the Khanid Family, with
    their Khanid troops, were on the forefront. The Khanid Family earned great renown
    and power, being granted numerous holdings by the Emperor. The Family rose up
    the echelons of the Empire's ranks, coming to be part of the [Council of Apostles](nTZLcvZprqLLUiGIaVQu7).\n\nThe
    Family used its influence to move many of its Khanid followers to their domains,
    drawing them away from the other noble houses. Though not all of the Khanid people
    followed the Family into its new domains, a large portion did, and those who came
    were granted titles and land by the Family to earn their loyalty.\n\nWhen the
    [Moral Reforms](48nuiRGJ4i8BwACDI9a58u) began, the Khanid Family sensed the winds
    of change blowing. They sided with the Emperor, lending the power of the Khanid
    people. In the end, the Emperor granted the Khanid Family a position on the new
    [Privy Council](privy-council), making them one of the five leading families of
    the Empire.\n\nThe Family had several emperors following the Moral Reforms, [Damius
    III](4YXvIhUK7GjrXhK4dZ5AOM) the most notable among them.\n\n\n#### Rebellion\nIn
    early 22760 AD, Garkeh Khanid was made the Heir of the Khanid Family. A young
    and ambitious man, Garkeh was also the commander-in-chief of the [Amarr Navy](3PKvXZS0iHKIgAmO9np74g).
    When the Emperor died in 22762 AD, Garkeh was widely considered the favorite to
    take his place.\n\nStunningly, it was Heideran [Kador](3ium7VluTCFnGS0TqpinlO)
    who was made the Emperor instead. Garkeh was infuriated and refused to commit
    the ritual suicide [Shathol'Syn](7uCmeRGL3bgVWlEWQ9TZQb). Instead, he confiscated
    one of the Empire's two [Titans](XH5ZPvSBGGIStAEWqWHOl) and took a large portion
    of the Navy loyal to him, and fled to his family's domains. From there, he sent
    the [Theology Council](38uUjWk3RiR80FqDwjmQWk) an inverted Amarr symbol, taken
    to show his primacy over religious laws.\n\nHe then declared that he would not
    commit suicide or give himself up to the Empire, founding the Khanid Kingdom and
    taking the name Khanid II (posthumously naming his father Khanid I). Because the
    Empire was still settling following the ascension of Heideran VII, the Kingdom
    remained unmolested for the first few months of its life.\n\nNot every member
    of his family supported his ambitions, however. [Dakos Khanid](2CGsSq28P4XpQqSoUrW3Kp),
    the younger brother of Khanid II, opposed the rebellion and rebelled himself.
    He sought the assistance of the Empire, which had by then calmed itself enough
    to launch a military assault on the Kingdom. The two sides struggled for a few
    months, but Khanid II proved himself capable of doing anything to preserve himself,
    having Dakos assassinated.\n\nWith Dakos dead, his followers quickly fell to pieces.
    With no more allies in the Kingdom, the Empire withdrew its forces, preferring
    instead to harass the Kingdom's border. In order to ensure that no further rebellions
    were made against him, Khanid II demanded that all women and children belonging
    to the family spend the majority of their time at the royal palaces, acting as
    hostages.\n\n\n#### Modern Day\nThe Khanid Family is nominally the ruling family
    of the Khanid Kingdom, though the majority of their power remains tied directly
    to Khanid II. No royal heir has been named, though Khanid II remains in good health
    despite his advancing age. Some say that he has abandoned the concept of [Sacred
    Flesh](3k3re1JeaMxvvTRz3qARFv) and has had himself [cloned](5y5CUyA9h4xXY40dInhn3o).\n\nIn
    [YC 111](1nWwkV0QgotpxAOb5HQ6CA), the Khanid Kingdom assisted the Empire in the
    capture of [Dochuta Karsoth](1qDadkKQ3HzwYZpl2r4JLL). For their assistance, and
    in an effort to find additional allies who would not oppose her on the grounds
    of having been cloned, Empress [Jamyl I](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L) offered the Family
    a seat on her Privy Council. Khanid II accepted her offer, yet remained separate
    from the Empire.\n\nThere are some whispers that Khanid II is not content with
    simply being the King of his own realm and seeks to reestablish the Khanid Family
    as a full Heir House. Perhaps, they say, he even wishes to become Emperor outright,
    though he has made no action to support such rumors.\n\n### Family Seal\nThe Khanid
    Family has two seals it uses in official matters, both cast in the green-tinged
    silver that is the family's color. The first, and oldest symbol, is of an ornate
    eye positioned inside a triangle. This was the original seal of the Family and
    the one it used for thousands of years. \n\nThe second seal was adopted following
    Khanid II's rebellion. It is an inverted form of the symbol the Amarr Empire uses.
    Theologically, the half-circle represents God, while the half-circle with attached
    triangle represents mankind. The symbol has been read to represent the primacy
    of man's law over God's law, though Khanid II has never declared that as his intent.\n\nIn
    most matters, the Khanid Family uses the newer symbol. However, on Theology Council
    grounds and in the Privy Council, the Family uses its older symbol, as a concession
    against conservative elements in the Empire.\n\n\n### See Also\n\n* [Khanid Kingdom](5VtgxEr1vnxuazt8lvQLoj)\n*
