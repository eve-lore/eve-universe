- body: 'The **Vampire** was a prototype [combat drone](5TesdXq5to62CrbIBuPXxS) developed
    by an unnamed company or

    group. It was legendary for its cost - rumored to cost as much as a

    fully fitted [cruiser](3wE5sDRggwgYjiExdCRyL0). It was also said to be

    running an experimental wetware [AI](67UaJpJzvXXlhQc8a0GnWR) brain. The prototype

    of the drone was destroyed in an engagement with three

    [Guristas](55L861YhB1ZfaAST6ZbhdO) pirates as it was being moved by the

    pilot [Uragan Zelp](1EGr4d83ZVFXWR1jPsxaxw). The drone itself had a red

    carapace and arachnid eyes.
