    to planets, moons, suns or even stations or other particular\ncelestial objects,
    but are nonetheless so renowned through the cluster\nthat they deserve their own
    entries. Other locations relate to specific\nlocations, usually planetside, but
    have become so famous that their\nreputations have extended to celestial heights.\n\nNotable
    interstellar locations\n------------------------------\n\n-   The [ABF](WMBX2Ks93HW71o5i1x2Fx)
    was not a place anyone should have to grow\n    up in.\n-   [Choonka's Diner](1OnaD9rlbv9swAZyOD4O9Z).\n-
    \  The [City of God](6bnrd04bo5T04nAelip7cS).\n-   The [Crielere Research Facilities](3Y34ZySL2hebLjco1Y25IK)
    were a\n    famous cross-empire science endeavor that ended in amazing\n    breakthroughs
    and terrible losses of life.\n-   [Divinity's Edge](1ZlQT0vWU0K0WiiGrew2cU) was
    once the border of\n    known space.\n-   [The Electric Museum](6FUymY4Xs59PihSLEs6u3Q)
    is a\n    station-based [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) showcase of corporate\n
    \   technological history.\n-   The [EVE Gate](2z1KQXUVtPP1WmlwcJaX4o) is where
    we came from, no matter\n    what any [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) says.\n-
    \  The [Golgothan Fields](42oxJZbTitYjBLLLOEEqh5) are a site of\n    past warfare
    and destruction between the Amarr and\n    [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp).\n-
    \  The [Mekhios Graveyard](2Z9uhf2FpAWCbiIYUltB1h)\n-   The [New Colony](6cqzYEL9lVMn6APNJMCzvT)
    was managed by\n    [Fermar](7cLMQC182YuCCSfazxcPbY).\n-   The [Old Colony](7F4mXQ0x2Q4fCORw8MKm3W)
    was managed by\n    [Melvue](3lGS0xpEmMiYeWCooS7r4O).\n-   [Outpost 3478](4vqxY65eebQdhV55hWSbjE)
    was hit by\n    [Sansha](53mEByew2BMbNSMcjG7Ky7)).\n-   The [Relay Tower](3CBBhBMvttahWSmqUoDAE1)
    was one of the main\n    backbones of the [FTL communications networks](slULqrFiu06fLmeraX1QL).\n-
    \  The [Row of Wings](6OfgpUAMbyzXNGdlpWqzwG) was an exhibition of\n    ship parts.\n-
    \  The [School of Applied Science](school-of-applied-Science) was an educational\n
    \   institution\n-   [The Solari Constructs](16jyPoGQuKzgMNUl7UbYHf)\n-   [Sovicou](3bFH4a0UeEG2PRs7vkKcBu)
    is a place in the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK).\n    -   [Caduceus](670J6Ig4gvuntTXjO4v0E0)
    is a place \"on Sovicou.\"\n-   [Theriese](4H8wNZnIqDRowpCuSlERYv) held a nasty
    surprise.\n-   The [Vapor Sea](3iAejc9wCucgaKqw0F1pP0) is a unique expanse of
    space.\n-   [YBH-349](3Vm9etpqIu89RkodTtnPEH) was used by sneaky Caldari spies.\n\n###
    Others\n\nThere is also a number of locations whose exact nature, location or
    name\nis as yet unknown:\n\n-   Sites (wreckage guarded by pirates) where [Nale's](6UCrnplXyEjy3djnjEKnUq)\n
    \   search team found pieces, both real and fake, related to a\n    mind-control
    machine codenamed the Book of Emptiness.\n-   Site where drone research was being
    undertaken, right up until the\n    point where at least [one drone](unnamed-rogue-drone-lore)
    went rogue and\n    slaughtered everyone.\n-   Wherever the [Mind Clash](22qTwYMQWYFPScEBt16DVA)
    World Championship\n    are held.\n-   There is an asteroid mining colony in the
    depths of lowsec space\n    where the Empires vie for control. With the coming
    of the\n    [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) combatants, the majority of the\n
    \   crew have abandoned, leaving behind only a skeleton crew. Just as\n    the
    skeleton crew is growing capable of running the colony, a group\n    of pirates
    attack. They detonate surface explosives to collapse\n    several sections, then
    board the colony and begin a rampage. They\n    manage to kill most of the inhabitants
    with their laser guns. Only\n    [Adek](4PQKp7FBmnvpxkpuHGB36v) manages to escape.
    He reaches the Pit, the\n    section of the asteroid that has been mined out extensively
    and has\n    several tunnels that lead right next to the vacuum of space. Adek\n
    \   initially plans to give up, but has a sudden burst of inspiration.\n    He
    goes to the Pit's control station and sets off an alarm, drawing\n    the entire
    pirate party to the Pit. He then remotely activates an\n    [MTAC](6tgB9Z8SmRZ7VUX3qScODq)
    to punch a hole into the vacuum, blowing\n    several pirates into space and causing
    the rest to lose their\n    weapons and become helpless. Adek boards an MTAC and
    finishes off\n    the rest. As he waits, he discovers one pirate had stayed behind.\n
    \   Adek discovers that a capsuleer has arrived outside the colony. He\n    sends
    out a distress call, telling the capsuleer what has happened\n    and saying the
    colony should be destroyed and the cargo retrieved.\n    Adek then runs to a cargo
    container, seals himself inside, and waits\n    as the capsuleer destroys the
    colony.\n-   There is a [CreoDron](3lCriaLYr0Nrmj9pkru5Z3) boardroom that shows
    a\n    view of the pale blue Carirgnottin I in front of a glowing crimson\n    nebula
    through one of the clear walls. Dim starlight also shines\n    through onto a
    large table that has a speaker set into the middle\n    of it. It is in this boardroom
    the existence of a civilization in\n    wormhole space was first brought to light,
    as well as where the\n    decision was made to send a person through a wormhole.\n-
    \  An unnamed colony, located somewhere within Gallente space, but\n    occupied
    by the Caldari State during [YC111](1nWwkV0QgotpxAOb5HQ6CA).\n    Resources on
    this colony are scarce.\n-   An unnamed asteroid colony in the middle of nowhere.
    Visitors are\n    given coordinates and then their ship is disabled before they
    are\n    brought inside. A city of stone is encased inside the asteroid and\n
    \   the colonists live off of it. Stalactites like cathedrals hang from\n    above
    while stalagmites are hollowed out and used as buildings.\n\nNotable planetary
    locations\n---------------------------\n\nThere is a number of locations extant
    on planetary surfaces:\n\n-   [Amarr Island](4wZzhhUMIfR4ziHGaMOiLJ) on [Amarr
    Prime](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4). It is small enough that a solar\n    eclipse caused
    by [Zorast](1PoS7ZiZUXSHjf81r7jkmq) could cover the entire\n    island in its
    umbra.\n    -   [Dam-Torsad](UI6KVmdCZ0H42EvHijFVZ) is a city on Amarr Island.\n
    \       -   [Torsad-Laur](2w4NAgugzCIUNDLfeIk0C8) is one of\n            its districts.\n
    \           -   [Chopamaia Yard](chopamaia-yard) can be found\n                in
    the district of Torsad-Laur.\n            -   [The Font](5RxK1w3XAFJRKPGHFrjtoN)
    is a taproom\n                in Torsad-Laur.\n    -   [Edras](gEncrKUuU49lkOAgNgvkY),
    too, was on Amarr Island.\n    -   [Iphria](40Xji7LgN4imC5rbc4Tc1h) was on Amarr
    Island.\n    -   [Istha](4IGx6wlK31zpVAsBqnGb8B) was on Amarr Island.\n    -   [Melekel](5VmqiU201HhnPAivZUjWBE)
    was on Amarr Island.\n-   [The Arch of Nekater](2IxQis0oVrbEJh1gWVWEx0) can also
    be\n    found in the Torsad-Laur district.\n-   [Caille](73TXaac6RTgSJaqJHkTxCz)
    on [Gallente Prime](41JbD6M3Keq024T44ULv7a) has been called a city of wonders.\n
    \   -   The [Crystal Boulevard](45ZcfxzqF7v2mqmLksGxYU) is one of\n        those
    wonders.\n    -   The [Glittering Dream](WPpsbdA18JYzPyQlCNQh3) nightclub is\n
    \       one, too.\n-   The [Court Chamberlain's antechamber](3W4krTLGOQqhYqlc2qAG1N)
    was a\n    fixture on Amarr Prime.\n-   [The Garden](7KEnC4LUCQQvVdNJZWXaKt) is
    a beautiful place\n    for diplomacy.\n-   A [Garden of Contemplation](4gFdMXv7phxEup4bRflTBN)
    also\n    exists on Amarr Prime\n-   [Giraldi's](2zfHXdHXBqtXqpJXg1kQF6) is a
    restaurant.\n-   [Hueromont](1PzpjLA0ZHtQRZu2f8x4gO), a once war-torn city on
    [Gallente Prime](41JbD6M3Keq024T44ULv7a).\n-   The [Kaalakiota Peaks](tSXx52ZNNlyu2MYXtOiMT)
    are very\n    important set of mountains on Caldari Prime.\n-   [Nouvelle Rouvenor](7aF13uW1tkTLI8stM52xK),
    a once-notorious\n    underwater Caldari city.\n-   [Outpost 4972](7lJLYLN8srQsuRHZJsCfVR)
    was the site of a theft and\n    a brutal interrogation.\n-   [Shishaan](7urulQrhxeCEOEHkK0s17m)
    is a city on\n    [Matar](5gheCRHTWLbi5jzbo5vvT6).\n-   The [Tal-Romon Cathedral](sQa3CgriPhcdRyu5wArOb)
    is located\n    on Amarr Prime.\n-   [Torsad-Laur](2w4NAgugzCIUNDLfeIk0C8) is
    a cultural mixing pot.\n\n### Others\n\nAs with interstellar locations, though,
    there is also a number of\nplanetside places whose exact nature, location, name
    or planetary origin\nis as yet unknown:\n\n-   The Amarr Royal Court, where, among
    other things, Mind Clash is\n    played.\n-   There are various Caldari gambling
    halls, where, among other games,\n    it is possible to see games of Mind Clash.\n-
    \  Several Society of Conscious Thought [Kitzes](4Sgvr2KzwFRAX0nwKpGNSW)\n    exist.\n-
    \  [King Khanid's](5HlA8KgFOuLy4jTf3t54xf) stolen\n    [Titan](XH5ZPvSBGGIStAEWqWHOl),
    of whatever antique design it may be, is\n    presumably floating around somewhere
    still, as Titans cannot be\n    docked.\n-   There is an unknown prisoner planet
    in the Minmatar Republic.\n    Somewhere on the planet, in the middle of a desert
    surrounded by a\n    swampy jungle, is a prison complex housing Amarr prisoners
    that have\n    been secretly tried by Minmatar military courts and deemed a threat\n
    \   to freedom. Wild slaver hounds live in the jungle. Supplies are\n    hot-dropped
    into the desert, where they are retrieved by specially\n    selected prisoners.
    The guards at the camp cruelly force the\n    prisoners to play \"games\" or risk
    severe punishment. Physical and\n    sexual abuse of the prisoners is common,
    and prisoners are\n    overworked in order to break their spirits. A man known
    as the King\n    has escaped the prison camp and lives in a shack in the jungle.
    The\n    guards and the King have some sort of agreement, as those who have\n
    \   found the King are spared participation in the guards' games.\n-   In Gallente
    space, there is a somewhat rustic city with stone\n    buildings and streets,
    wooden fences, narrow alleyways\n    and cul-de-sacs. It is located in the hemisphere
    known for rough\n    weather on the planet.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n-   [Regions](regions)\n-
