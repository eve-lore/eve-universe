    and [Civire](1lEM3yHeoK1HEpa1FrLwH5).


    Back in the days when the the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) occupied

    Caldari Prime, each bloodline developed on a separate continent and was

    very distinct both physically and culturally. At the start of the war

    with the [Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) the Caldari race was uprooted

    as a whole and thrown into a melting pot where fighting for their

    survival was all that mattered. The frantic decades that followed

    altered the Caldari psyche forever. Discipline and loyalty came to the

    forefront and still shapes Caldari society into something new. Currently

    people in the State identify themselves as Caldari first, their

    corporation second, and their bloodline a distant third. None of the

    megacorps are structured around

    bloodlines and they intermingle freely on every level. Even so,

    intermarriages are rare, but this is thought to be more a matter of

    physical preference. Although the individual bloodlines are proud of

    their heritage, it ranks low in importance.
