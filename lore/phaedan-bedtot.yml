- body: '**Phaedan Bedtot** is the husband of [Jania Bedtot](56BeuvPy8Z92016R3TH5ER)
    and father of

    [Adara](38mR2djgLfz4rZhoNps85G). He apparently used to visit her

    regularly, and they spoke over relays when they worked. It seems the two

    have not met in some time, however, and may be estranged. Under torture,

    Jania promised to bring Phaedan to [Outpost 4972](7lJLYLN8srQsuRHZJsCfVR).
