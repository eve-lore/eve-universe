    It has a high ceiling that ended in tinted windows that changes color based on
    the strength of the sunlight. In the afternoon it is golden, in the evening blood
    red, and in the morning uplifting and bright. The walls are covered in icons and
    tapestries of the five [Heirs](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh), important [Holders](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v),
    and depictions of previous [Emperors](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ). In his time, [Dochuta
    Karsoth](1qDadkKQ3HzwYZpl2r4JLL) also enjoyed access to a hidden passageway that
    led to a room often used for orgies and consumption of drugs.
