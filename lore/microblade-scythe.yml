    still used in many parts of the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) to harvest
    wheat.


    Historical Background

    ---------------------


    Microblade technology is a more recent development of a stone-age

    innovation, one that has fallen out of use almost everywhere except on

    the wheat plantations of the Amarr Empire. Discovered independently by a

    variety of people, its use died out almost everywhere. Only the

    [Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw) continued to use this technology up

    to modern times, specifically to form clearings in the thick jungles of

    [Starkman Prime](hhT3DOiMGuhLQl0vmNbuY). Its use was readapted for

    [wheat](5nxVzXKqvyLGbxwGIW1MVy) harvesting by the Amarr, and proved more

    economical than previous tools, as they were cheap and easy to make. It

    has been the preferred tool for harvesting wheat throughout the Empire

    ever since.


    Appearance

    ----------


    Microblade scythes have a slightly down-curved blade, approximately 24

    centimeters long, and six centimeters wide, usually fashioned from

    silica-rich stone. The handles are typically wood, though some

    ornamental scythes have handles made from bone. Usually about a meter in

    length, these handles are often wrapped with leaves near the top and

    bottom for a more comfortable grip.
