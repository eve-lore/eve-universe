- body: '**Storm Wind** is one of the Caldari spirits.


    Storm Wind is the fiercest of the Winds, aside from an enraged Cold

    Wind, but also has a playful side, dancing among the peaks and teasing

    Mountain Wind. Storm Wind is the pelting rain of the mountain highlands,

    crackling as it turns to sleet, the flash of lightning and boom of

    thunder, and the smell of ozone. Storm Wind is a force of battle, of man

    against man and man against the elements, the hottest forge to fashion

    the strongest steel. Storm Wind is especially important to the Caldari

    military, whose funerals are often scheduled to occur in the middle of

    poor weather as an offering.


    Other divine entities include [Wind-of-the-West](3FsbhfAVn48VZcWAXiTReI), [Cold
    Wind](16iSgSK58hOq8DIlx2oqKS), [Heart-of-the-Forest](3zH6qMixgVJtQUgHF3KFFM),
    and [Mountain Wind](NEtuLo38zgFK9ZA0sGYCk).
