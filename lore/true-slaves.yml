    These True Slaves fill a variety of\nfunctions, from custodial and other menial
    labors to serving as the\nprimary navy of the Nation. These True Slaves come primarily
    from\nabducted populations, which are then fitted with Slave Implants. These\nimplants
    are highly advanced cybernetic control systems that completely\nsubvert the will
    of those implanted to that of Sansha Kuvakei and his\nloyal commanders.\n\nTrue
    Slaves have no will of their own and are often described as\n\"mindless\" by outsiders.
    However, individuals can show varying degrees\nof personality and freedom, depending
    on their personal predilections\ntoward to the Nation and task. Scouts, which
    approach settlements and\noffer surrender terms, often appear much as they did
    before being fitted\nwith implants and retain a high degree of individuality.
    Similarly,\nthe commanders of Sansha fleets are allowed to retain their creativity\nand
    decision-making skills, so as to more easily react to the rapidly\nchanging conditions
    of a battlefield.\n\nMost True Slaves are kept in a form of hive-mind which constantly
    feeds\ndata between Sansha's central command and the individual slaves. This is\nreferred
    to as a direct feed, as everything the True Slave experiences\nis sent back for
    analysis. Additionally, instructions can be broadcast\nto the True Slaves, which
    they are compelled to follow.\n\nIt is incredibly difficult to remove Slave Implants
    once they have been\ninstalled. After a certain time has passed, which differs
    from person to\nperson, a True Slave's individuality has been broken in such a
    way that\npsychological recovery is highly unlikely and the process is therefore
    irreversible. These True Slaves desire only death, either in service of\n[Sansha](17GtFlYwgztQDPD4Uotuv8)
    or by suicide, should they be freed\nfrom their bonds.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n-
