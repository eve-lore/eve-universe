- body: 'The **Sin Eater** is an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) torture device. It
    is a sarcophagus with two metal arms ending in long needles attached. As with
    the [Holy Star](5O5B2bkCF6R0eO3ZkumPCz), the device is notable for its use by
    [Vitor Dranera](3KDpilEZ7Q2EdkIumRKMus), who favors it when dealing with spies
    and other undesirables in his labs.


    Usage

    -----


    When activated, the needles enter the body of the person trapped inside the sarcophagus
    and slowly push further in, "purifying" the person inside in some manner by "eating
    their sins".


    The exact internal mechanism, which produces a foul smell, has not been confirmed
    but is presumably very painful. It is not suffocation, since the device comes
    with an air tube. As the needles supposedly "eat" the victim''s sin, it seems
    likely they suck out the person''s bodily fluids.
