    The Caldari Navy is smaller in personnel and total ships than both the Federation
    Navy and the Imperial Navy, yet they have more battleships than any other fleet
    and the average age of the Caldari ships is considerably less. This is because
    the Caldari are constantly replacing their oldest ships with newer ones, with
    better hi-tech equipment. The strategic doctrine of the Caldari Navy is simple:
    to be able to defeat any other navy in the world. Most experts believe it is.'
