    The [Minmatar rebellion](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N) saw many

    battles, both on ground and in space. The largest of the space battles

    took place in the Ennur system a few weeks after the start of the

    rebellion.


    The main [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) battle fleet had returned from

    [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G) space and intended to break the power of the

    rebels once and for all by sweeping through their core systems. The

    [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) met the Amarr with everything they had

    in a fierce battle that lasted for hours. In the end the Minmatar

    withdrew and the Amarr claimed victory, but the Minmatar had succeeded

    in disabling or destroying the best capital ships in the Amarr fleet,

    thus reducing their offensive strength dramatically.


    Today the old battlefield, commonly known as Golgothan Fields, is

    littered with old shipwrecks and infested with pirates that have taken

    refuge in the giant hulks. They fiercely defend their base, but daring

    scavengers can still sneak in and rummage around.
