    firearms, but otherwise serve their purpose admirably.


    Variants

    --------


    Modern variants can switch between different types of

    [ammo](3H9y8JmkecR6s5GhErOukQ), have large ammo capacities to support

    sustained automatic fire and are gyrostabilized to control recoil.

    Simpler variants are cheap and difficult to pick up on scanners since

    they have no energy signature. Some projectile based weapons are also

    capable of functioning in an area effected by an EMP blast because they

    lack electronic components.


    Railguns

    --------


    A completely different kind of projectile based weapons are railguns.

    They are a little less common in handheld applications, because handheld

    models usually lack the caliber to be able to fire grenades containing a

    plasma charge. This plasma charge is an important part of the firepower

    of larger starship railguns. However, they posses good accuracy and

    range and are thus used for sniper applications. Low-powered

    electromagnetic accelerators are also used to chuck large caliber

    grenades. One advantage of railguns is their penetration - allowing them

    to pierce astounding amounts of armor.


    Railguns appear to be a common infantry weapon for the Caldari, enough

    that even civilian personnel have no problem using them when necessary
