    understood, and most important rituals. Involving a specialized sort of [tattooing](5K88SAucdcLeQ07oEOROpy)
    process that marks the subject's body, the Voluval is a rite of passage practiced
    by nearly all sub\\-clans of all tribes in the Republic. It is also known as the
    Test of Destiny and is the seminal event in a young Mimatar's life, representing
    their coming of age and official recognition as a member of the tribe.\n\nHistorical
    Background\n---------------------\n\nThere have always been various ritualized
    rites of passage amongst the\nMinmatar. While different rituals have been favored
    at different times\nby different tribes, none has ever been so pervasive or wide-spread
    as\nthe Voluval.\n\nIt is believed that some of the earliest Minmatar rites of
    passage were\ndesigned to test the subject, not so they could pass or fail, but
    to\nidentify what areas they may need help in as they moved into adulthood.\nSome
    of the most barbaric and torturous rituals were designed for these\nbenign purposes.
    Later rites of passage began to develop towards a\nphysically easier curve, and
    as they did so, the negative associations\nwith failing the tests grew in significance.
    Initially, this resulted in\nthe subject of a 'bad' or 'failed' rite of passage
    being shunned by the\ntribe or given distasteful jobs.\n\nThe Voluval was developed
    by Vherokior mystics during their time wandering the Greater Sobaki Desert. When\nthe
    Vherokior emerged from the desert around five thousand years ago and\nbegan traveling
    in small caravans amongst the other tribes, the Voluval\nspread with them. Tattoos
    were already such an important part of Tribal\nlife that the practice caught on
    quickly. Population pressures on Matar\nsoon saw the introduction of banishment
    with certain, rare, bad marks.\n\nDuring the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) rule
    of the Minmatar, all cultural\ntattoos were banned, and the secrets of the Voluval
    were thought lost.\nWhen the Amarr yoke had been finally been thrown off, tattoos
    were one\nof the first things to be returned to their place of cultural\nimportance.
    Even before the formation of the Republic, Vherokior mystics announced that they
    had\nheld on to the knowledge of the Voluval all through their long\nsubjugation.
    In a culture striving to re-establish its identity and\ntribal roots, the resurrected
    ritual achieved an even greater\nimportance.\n\nNow, in a curious parallel to
    how the ritual initially spread, Vherokior\nmystics make regular trips to both
    the [Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK)\nand the Great Wildlands, in an effort
    to include the Gallente-Minmatar and the\nThukker in the practice. In the Republic,\nmany
    returning [Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw) and\n[Nefantar](1lfEcB4SdrV3EJIrmYWOK2)
    have also shown an inclination to fit in\nby undergoing the ritual, even those
    that hold on to their Amarr faith.\nWhile normally undergone in adolescence, exceptions
    are being made\nregularly as the Republic opens its arms to its returning people.\n\nConversely,
    while the practice of the Voluval is growing in importance,\nthe significance
    of the marks themselves seems to be on the wane. Even\nso, there are still those
    that experience harsh consequences for their\nmarks. Enforced vows of silence
    and banishment are still practiced,\nthough some families are now in a position
    to support those with bad\nmarks, and they simply disappear following an unfavorable
    outcome for\none of their kin.\n\nThe Voluval in Practice\n-----------------------\n\n###
    Process\n\nThe Voluval uses a special type of tattooing process, consisting of
    two\ninjections. One is an injection of tyrosine, the amino acid precursor to\nmelanin,
    and it is administered to the heart. The second injection,\ndelivered to the ventral
    root near the base of the spinal nerve, is a\nformula known only to Vherokior
    mystics, and is a secret still closely\nguarded by them even today.\n\nA few decades
    ago, the Quafe company\ninvestigated the possibility of using a similar form of
    tattooing as\npart of an enhanced marketing strategy. The Quafe company sent a
    small\nteam of scientists to the Greater Sobaki Desert to gather flora and\nfauna.
    They claimed great results using acetylcholine as a\nneurotransmitter, along with
    oxytocin, calcitonin, and vasoactive\nintestinal peptide hormones extracted from
    Sobaki Water-Root. Unable\nto identify any further ingredients, nor willing to
    commit any more\nresources to the venture, the project was shut down. There is
    evidence\nto suggest the Amarr may have figured out the formula, but it is\ncircumstantial
    at best. \n\nVherokior mystics have since confirmed the inclusion of Sobaki\nWater-Root
    in the Voluval formula, saying it is simply one tooth of the\nkey to unlock one's
    Voluval tattoo. They believe the formula of the\nsecond injection directs the
    subconscious to manipulate the melanin from\nthe first injection into forming
    a permanent tattoo. It is for this\nreason Vherokior mystics insist proper mental
    preparation is a necessary\npart of the Voluval.\n\n### Preparation\n\nProper
    preparation for the Voluval ritual is of such importance that\nthose about to
    undergo it study for weeks. In the past, rituals were\nperformed individually,
    with each person having their own Mentor. Over\ntime, the Voluval came to be done
    in larger groups and the duties of the\nMentor were assumed by an Essence Instructor.\n\nThis
    job is usually handled by a local shaman and consists mostly of\nrelating legends,
    providing instruction in clearing the mind, and giving\nadvice and guidance. This
    is never more important than the day of the\nVoluval itself, where it is common
    for the Essence Instructor to be\nsequestered for up to six hours with those about
    to experience the\nritual. \n\nThe Voluval can be done anywhere the tribe can
    gather, though the many\nsacred sites on [Matar](5gheCRHTWLbi5jzbo5vvT6) tend
    to host the largest ones.\n\n### The Marking\n\nThough the exact proceedings of
    the Voluval vary slightly depending on\ncircumstances, the main sequence of events
    remain the same. As the\nleader of the ceremony, the Spirit Conductor's entrance
    signals the\ncommencement of the Voluval. Once the Spirit Conductor and their
    various\nattendants have taken their place, the music starts. Adults in the crowd\nwho
    have already gone through the Voluval join the Spirit Conductor in\nthe singing
    of a traditional song. This is where the greatest deviation\namong Voluval ceremonies
    occurs, as the song is often a local one,\nthough the musical accompaniment is
    usually provided by Singing Staffs.\n\n\nOne at a time, those being tested kneel
    before the Spirit Conductor, who\napplies to their head an elixir meant to cleanse
    the spirit. As he\nplunges the first injection directly into the heart, the Spirit\nConductor
    chants sacred words in a quiet prayer. The Spirit Conductor\nthen circles around
    behind the subject, and injects the second mixture\ninto the base of the spine.\n\nAt
    this point it is the participant's turn to speak. What is said is up\nto the individual,
    though it was originally intended to be a declaration\nof their outlook on life,
    themselves, or their surroundings. Over time\nmany sayings have become standardized
    amongst certain families and\nsub-clans.\n\nThe Spirit Conductor places a black
    mantle around the subject's head and\nshoulders as the injections begin to work.
    Within a few minutes, the\nVoluval mark appears. The Spirit Conductor then removes
    the mantle, and\nthe mark is revealed to all.\n\nAfter all the participants have
    their marks, the Spirit Conductor closes\nthe ceremony by leading a short group
    prayer. \n\n### Outcome\n\nMost Voluval ceremonies end with the participants being
    welcomed and\nrecognized by the tribe. Nearly all marks tend to be benign, with
    some\neven tending towards being hereditary, like the horned triangle of the\nGraur
    family. [Karin Midular's](3KxlNVAeglPj5ZH0sf3U2j) mark, the Ray\nof Matar, is
    the rarest and most auspicious of the Voluval marks. \n\nThe rarest of the negative
    marks such as the Pale Eye, the Face of\nHelina, or the Broken Shield can see
    its bearer out cast by the\nMinmatar, banished to Arzad II. Less rare,\nthough
    still not common, are the other detrimental marks such as the\nSpiraling Circle,
    the Scarecrow, the Purple Cross, or the Slaver's\nFang. These marks may force
    the bearer into a self-imposed, life-time\nvow of silence, under traditional penalty
    of having their tongues cut\nout should they ever break it. In recent years it
    has become common\nfor those with these marks to choose a life of exile over the
    burden of\nbearing their shame amongst their kin.\n\nThe Voluval and Capsuleers\n--------------------------\n\n###
    Capsuleer Clones\nGiven that there are significant physiological differences between
    a baseline human's birth body and capsuleer clones, which are biological constructs,
    the physical processes involved in the ritual of evoking a voluval mark have a
    different range of effects to those seen when a standard human goes through the
    ritual. The effects are as variable but any marks produced are frequently quite
    different and seen as uninterpretable in the framework of the voluval ceremony.
    Put very simply, the traditional voluval often does not work properly on a capsuleer
    clone. There are believed to be radical variants of the process and ceremony that
    can reliably produce a traditional mark on an active clone, though this is the
    stuff of rumor, conjecture and, perhaps, unorthodox shamanic practice. \n\nWhen
    a Minmatar capsuleer's birth body is terminated, any voluval marking they may
    have can be effectively reproduced on a cellular level when their prepared capsuleer
    clone is sculpted. This is similar to reproduction of birth marks, freckles, scars,
    inked tattoos and other such marks as a capsuleer wishes to retain on their body
    according to their specifications. In the case of the voluval a similar level
    of cellular alteration is replicated but the cellular structures are essentially
    artifical and the replication is an artifice of the clone preparation process.
    While the mark is to visual inspection identical to the original, there are basic
    differences that can detected with the correct equipment.\n\nCapsuleers can choose
    to dispense with skin marks, defects and scars as a simple change of specification
    when the clone is prepared. Relatively simple body-modding techniques can also
    achieve such alterations of an active capsuleer construct body without cloning
    taking place. This has a variety of implications when it comes to the voluval
    mark and different interpretations have generated several schools of thought on
    the matter.\n\n### Cultural Attitudes\nRelated to this topic is the fact that
    in Minmatar society body- and mind-cloning are considered matters of deep personal
    ethics within the overall Matari traditional framework. Discussion of these things
    are not \"taboo\" in any strict sense but it is considered unseemly, to the point
    of infringing social ethics, to talk of the private cloning choices of another
    Matari in public, unless they themselves have openly spoken of it beforehand.
    Careless talk of private matters of this kind in front of non-Matari is considered
    a grave infringement of traditional ethics on a par with wearing an unearned ritual
    tattoo or tribal marking.\n\nThis aspect of Minmatar attitudes to cloning has
    important implications for non-capsuleers who avail themselves of cloning of one
    kind or another but, while still important to understand, certain of those potential
    implications are rendered moot by the simple fact that capsuleer status is a matter
    of public record. Even a first generation capsuleer, from the period when birth
    bodies were adapted for capsule pilot service, has always had to have a ready
    and prepared construct clone as a matter of legal requirement.\n\nEven though
    the fact of having a clone body prepared is unavoidably a matter of public record,
    other related choices can be considered private unless openly shared. Included
    in this would normally be whether or not a non-facial voluval mark has been reproduced
    through cellular sculpting or not. This can be an important matter in some contexts.
    Opinions across Minmatar society vary on the legitimacy of reproducing voluval
    marks on capsuleer clones. The issue is necessarily a relatively recent one but
    certain strands of thought have emerged in the last century or so. \n\n### Traditional
    Perspectives\nFor some Matari traditions, and typically for the more conservative
    in the relevant traditions, the reproduction of a voluval mark can be seen as
    an affront to an aspect of Minmatar culture that was preserved despite the privations
    and horrors of the Amarr occupation. This viewpoint is respected as valid within
    the broad family of the Matari traditions and the framework of Minmatar tribal
    society but it is a minority view, even among those Minmatar who place great importance
    on the voluval mark.\n\nThe large majority of Minmatar who even stop to think
    about this matter are not so conservative in their attitudes. Most consider the
    reproduction of the voluval mark by cellular sculpting on a capsuleer clone to
    be essentially a matter of copying an outward sign of what was revealed by the
    evocation of the mark in an individual's voluval ceremony. As attitudes to the
    voluval in Matari society vary hugely, even within individual tribes, it is not
    a topic of general controversy that many Minmatar capsuleers copy their marks
    over to new clones.\n\nThere are moreover approaches to Matari spirituality and
    traditional practice that would consider it only sensible and proper to prepare
    a familiar physical form for a spirit crossing from a dying body to one in which
    it may fully live again. In these traditions, the manifestation of ultra-conservative
    thinking may occasionally verge on seeing a failure to reproduce the voluval mark
    as problematic. On the whole, though, these traditions of spiritualism, often
    being the most animistic of the Matari world views, are notably more relaxed than
    many other strands of thinking.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n-   [Chronicle: The Outcast](1ins0n3dWs49CfqyLpowkR)\n-
