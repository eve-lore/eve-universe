- body: '**Brother Joshua** is a [Speaker of Truths](1McKwcKPI5eoFdjWPksJPS), an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
    religious official that, among his other duties, holds a right of judgment second
    only to the Emperor. He is known for intervening in a crisis inside the Kor-Azor
    region and ultimately delivering judgment against [Aritcio Kor-Azor](2puF18pxR6b7AVuy3HE9IV).


    Brother Joshua''s involvement in the Kor-Azor crisis was first rumored following
    the Holder revolt on Liparer II. He officially appeared several days later, right
    as the [Kor-Azor Family](1S0FEGgzJiwc4yXaG5AzjD) navy was planning on bombarding
    the planet''s largest settlement. Joshua ordered the navy to withdraw and began
    an investigation into allegations against Aritcio.


    While travelling through the region and hearing further grievances against Aritcio,
    Brother Joshua was frequently attacked by a variety of forces, and it was only
    through the efforts of various loyalist [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) groups
    that he survived. Once Brother Joshua had completed his investigation, he travelled
    to the royal palace of the Kor-Azor Family and, accompanied by a large number
    of [holders](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v), confronted Aritcio directly.


    After listing several of Aritcio''s crimes, Brother Joshua revealed that he sought
    a piece of flesh for every one of Aritcio''s misdeeds. Though Aritcio was an [Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh)
    and the penance would be reduced significantly, the number of crimes meant this
    would surely kill him. After some persuasion from Aritcio''s military advisor,
    Brother Joshua decreed that Aritcio would be spared death. Instead, he would have
    pieces of himself cut away until there was almost nothing left, then be healed
    by a [cellular regenerator](4liwftCjzbWBQHTNJb5OXJ), only for the process to repeat
    itself until the full extent of his crimes had been atoned for.
