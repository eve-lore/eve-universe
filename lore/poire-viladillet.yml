- body: '**Poire Viladillet** has been CEO of [Quafe Company](ssPYMESgTyz1rl4fTojD6)
    for thirty-five years and has grown

    the company from only one of several leading soft drink manufacturers to

    a corporation that holds clear and undisputed market supremacy.


    At one point he purchased Lost Stars, Inc, though he was too caught up

    in developing Quafe Enterprises to discover what was occurring with that

    company and their [Quafe+](7LIn9llI0ZBSXDQ1VxZr2g) product. He seems still

    unaware of where [Gehyr Aillon](4kOfLWgkI7AR34IBxJc0I3) is, despite the

    man''s involvement.
