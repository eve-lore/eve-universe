    **Scriptures** are not a single book, but\nrather the name given to the collective
    holy texts of Amarr. They are\nnot limited to just religious dogma; they describe
    everything from\nout-of-date codes of behavior to early technological breakthroughs.
    The\ncollective writings have been maintained and updated throughout the\ncenturies
    by Imperial Theologians and include texts that hearken back to\nthe very origins
    of Amarr society, written in a tongue so ancient as to\nbe unreadable by today's
    Amarr. The Scriptures are the very foundation\nstone of Amarr society, defining
    the daily lives of Amarr the Empire\nacross.\n\nThe Scriptures are also referred
    to as The Word (of God).\n\nThe original Scriptures were divinely given to the
    Amarr from divine\nbeings through prophets such as [Dano Gheinok](1vrzUVCmZxx7SvhoECvbyO),\nbut
    recent additions have come from [emperors](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ), saints, priests,
    and others.\n\nDue to these modifications, there exist many different books of
    the\nScriptures. Some have later been deemed apocryphal and been excised for\na
    variety of reasons; the most well known are the Apocryphon which is\nimportant
    to the [Sani Sabik](TDJbDXVg3cRp4b6FEkkFS) and the alternate\nScriptures of the
    [Order of St. Tetrimon](4Z9IYnlIENaSBblXROhEfY).\n\nThe full Scriptures are far
    too massive to collect in one place; the\n[Book of Records](5cxn8rCjeyzZ2Q4jZVH3zf)
    alone consists of millions\nof individual tomes. Some of the more well known passages
    are recorded\nbelow.\n\nBook I\n------\n\n \"In the beginning all things were
    as one. <br>\n God parted them and breathed life into his creation <br>\n Divided
    the parts and gave each its place <br>\n And unto each, bestowed purpose\" <br>\n

    the world came into being. <br>\nOur illustrious ancestors freed their souls from
    the evils of the\nold. <br>\nworld and created a new one.<br>\n The great Amarr
    Empire was founded to cultivate the spirit of man.<br> To do so the enemies of
    the outside had to be defeated and the enemies\nof the inside controlled.<br>\nThe
    Lord gave our Emperor the power to harness the Good and punish the Evil. <br>\nEver
    since, the Emperor has lived the lives of his subjects and breathed the air of
    authority.\" <br>\n*- The Scriptures, Book I 1:14*\n\n\n\"The Wrath of God is
    Immense. His Justice is Swift and Decisive. His \nTolerance is Limited. <br>\nBe
    Careful. Pure Thought is the Instigator of Sin. <br>\nBe Watchful. Free Thought
    is the Begetter of Disorder. <br>\nBe Respectful. Uniform Thought is the Way of
    Life. <br>\nThe Mercy of our Emperor is Limitless. His Rule is Benign and\nRighteous.

    II\n-------\n\n\"Our Lord visited his flock and saw that all was not good.<br>\nBlasphemy
    and heresy ruled the land.<br>\nThe Lord punished the sinners and drowned them

    of God. <br>\nThus they were saved and became God's chosen.\" <br>\n*- The Scriptures,

    II, Apocalypse 32:6*\n\n\"Casting his sight on his realm, the Lord witnessed <br>\nThe

    shall stand higher than you save the Sefrim, <br>\nWho serve Me as others shall
    serve you, <br>\nFor all things under Me serve one higher; <br>\nSo Amarr shall

    repent and pray for forgiveness. <br>\nBut true meekness is one that has penetrated

    saw the danger to his brother, and did not hesitate; without weapon or armor,
    he hurled himself at the beast, attacking with his bare hands. Enraged, the beast
    turned and struck Zakara, opening a terrible wound in his side.<br>\n\"Seizing
    the moment, Garum ran his sword through the beast's heart, thus ending the battle
    victorious. But Zakara, mortally wounded, cried out in pain. You sacrificed yourself

    Amarr Askura 10:3*\n\nEpitoth\n-------\n\n1 Now it came to pass in the third day
    of the first month of the tenth\nyear of the rule of emperor Amash-Akura that
    the midday deliberations\nwere abruptly brought to a halt when the day darkened
    in the sky. <br>\n2 And the sun went black as night and birds fell from the sky
    and\nflowers shriveled in the field and people fell sick in the streets and\nin
    the houses. <br>\n3 And in this moment of terrible distress the skies opened with
    a loud\nshriek and angels, bright as the sun was black, descended down to\nearth
    and their beauty soothed all the people and the animals alike. <br>\n4 And when
    the angels touched the ground with their feet the earth\nshook violently and fire
    engulfed those daring too near the\ndivinities. Their power being mighty and their
    presence potent the\npeople were wise not to look too closely upon them. <br>\n5
    The emperor came from his high seat with his retinue to meet with\nthe angels
    outside the city walls. And lo and behold! The moment the\nemperor passed below
    the city gates the sun cleared and shone as\nbrightly as ever before, all in the
    glory of the emperor and the\nheavenly angels that called upon him. <br>\n6 The
    angels spoke the language of God and called themselves sefrim:\nthose that guard
    the high seats of heaven. God ordered them here to\nprotect the emperor against
    all evils that ever beset him. <br>\n7 The sefrim offered unto the emperor a present
    from God as one\nbrother to another: Ametat the Scepter and Avetat the Crown,
    showing\nthe great pleasure God had in the earthly work of the emperor. <br>\n8
    And thus the sefrim came to serve the illustrious Amash-Akura, to\nstay by his
    side during the day and guard his sleep during the night.\nA great house of white
    stone and marble was built for the sefrim to\nreside in and were tended by the
    best servants the empire had to\noffer. <br>\n9 For a hundred years while the
    sefrim watched over the empire no wars\nor epidemics or famines ruined the lands
    and the people were content\nand joyous. <br>\n10 From Istha in the north and
    Melekel in the south and Edras in the\neast and from Iphria in the west people
    came to pray before the holy\nsefrim and receive a blessing to take home to their
    families. <br>\n11 The sefrim stood tall and beautiful, clad in their white and
    amber\nrobes, with masks of gold and silver to protect people from being\nstruck
    dead by their angelic beauty. <br>\n12 And all this time the emperor Amash-Akura
    did not age one day and\nwas as healthy and strong as the day he came of age.
    The Scepter gave\nhim vigor and the Crown gave him acumen and his rule was wise
    and\nfair. <br>\n13 Then Molok the Deceiver sundered the lands and the people
    suffered\nfloods and plagues conjured by him. Molok turned the people against\nthe
    sefrim and people who once sang their praise now abhorred them. <br>\n14 The emperor
    saw that all was not good and summoned the sefrim and\nsaid unto them, The people
    are in great distress, what remedies dost\nthou have? <br>\n15 And the sefrim
    answered, My Lord, the land has split against thee,\nthou must make war upon thine
    enemies to reclaim what is justly\nthine. <br>\n16 And the emperor asked, Wilt
    thou aid us in this perilous endeavor? <br>\n17 But the sefrim answered, No my
    Lord, we are here only to guide and\nto guard, it is forbidden to us to aggress
    upon any man. <br>\n18 Then be gone! The emperor said in anger, for his foes were\nformidable.
    <br>\n19 And the sefrim, no longer in the emperor's favor, returned whence\nthey
    had come that very day. And the moment they left, the sun went\nblack and people
    cried in anguish, for this was an evil omen. <br>\n20 And that night God spake
    unto emperor Amash-Akura in his sleep,\nsaying, Thy folly is great, Amash-Akura,
    thou hast rejected those I\nsent to thee in thine hour of need. Thou must redeem
    thyself to me by\nthine own merits. <br>\n21 And next day Amash-Akura had aged
    all his days and his hair was\nwhite and his skin wrinkled. But his spirit was
    high and his will\nresolute. God had charged him to take back his empire. <br>\n22
    For five years Amash-Akura battled his enemies, wielding Scepter\nand Crown, and
    he did triumph in the end. Molok the Deceiver was\nbrought before him in chains
    and sacrificed on the altar of God; the\nvery next day, the emperor died in his
    bedchamber, his task\nfulfilled. <br>\n23 And that night the sky turned red and
    the people were again happy\nthat God was content with them and the new emperor.
