    scientist and engineer [Tyma Raitaru](7ob8hxj1dDs8rWw7u6tNRt).

    In the design of Achilles, Raitaru combined the innovative approach of the researcher
    with the practical

    mindset of the craftsman. The Achilles missile didn''t employ any revolutionary
    new technology, but instead it combined many solid concepts and designs to make
    it extremely reliable and powerful for a

    small price. Forty years ago, Raitaru offered the blueprints for sale on the open
    market. The Achilles missile was at that time the best missile available and every
    empire and every faction wanted it.
