- body: 'The **wooden star** is a device the [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) use

    when engaging in torture. Like the torture itself, it is a basic device

    that has little history and no real personality. The device is shaped

    like a star and has very sharp points. It has been used, and presumably

    still is, by [Malachai](4uQaHhOH6Vnaro0QOYI8wB), a torturer to whom Song

    was apprenticed.
