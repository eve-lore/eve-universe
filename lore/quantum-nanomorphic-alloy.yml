- body: '**Quantum nanomorphic alloy** is a ternary alloy composed of germanium,

    palladium, and a reactive nanotech-based fusing component of

    [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G) origin. This material is used primarily as the

    outer shell casing of a pod [capsule](capsule-lore). The

    nano-material is composed of molecules whose composite atoms are capable

    of altering quantum states based on environmental stimuli to accommodate

    gravitonic induction and convergence.
