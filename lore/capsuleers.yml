    history. For a small group of select individuals\u2014those with the rare physical
    and mental characteristics required to survive the transition into posthumanism\u2014this
    technology would provide the gateway to power and riches beyond their wildest

    capsule,\u201D the device\u2019s full name is the hydrostatic capsule, and the
    pilot encased within its armored shell is known as a \"capsuleer\" (alternatively,
    \"capsule pilot\" or \"pod pilot\")."

    and the hydrostatic capsule are the two cornerstones of the capsuleer class, and
    as such represent arguably the two most important and influential technologies
    in New Eden. Clones, as used by capsuleers, can easily be considered the pinnacle
    of achievement in the allied sciences of cellular biology, molecular biology,
    and nanotechnology, and the capsule has all but revolutionized the starship field,
    outperforming any other method of vessel command by a wide margin.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t
    always so. When capsule technology was first made available, researchers and technicians
    soon discovered that despite the enormous advantages, capsule interfaces were
    extraordinarily difficult to use and posed a great deal of danger to those who
    attempted to do so, not least due to the myriad genetic differences between natural
    humans and their genetically engineered benefactors. For decades horror stories
    of the capsule circulated, creating a pernicious stigma around the technology.
    No financial or commercial institute was willing to invest the funding required
    to change the public perception that the capsule was essentially as effective
    as a highly sophisticated liquid-filled coffin.\n\nCloning, similarly, had not
    established much of a foothold until the last few decades. Not only was the process
    unreliable, but the very concept of cloning was also fiercely demonized by religious
    groups all over the universe for its perceived denial of the human soul. Prohibitively
    expensive and morally questionable, cloning was the domain of the dying rich.
    Even today, with cloning somewhat more commonly accepted (if not necessarily well
    regarded), stories persist of people blurring the lines of personhood and identity
    even further by cloning themselves into completely different bodies, across the
    gender and race gaps.\n\nIt is not known precisely when research into the principle
    of bringing together the capsule and the clone was conceived, nor when the capsule\u2019s
    technology was dusted off to be assessed for potential compatibility. However,
    several years ago, in early YC 104, a breakthrough was made that changed the face
    of space flight forever. After years of dedicated research into the workings of
    the human mind and its electrochemical processes, the first transneural burn scanner
    interface was successfully integrated, installed, and tested in a newly constructed
    first-generation prototype capsule.\n\nThe burning scanner works by taking a full
    and accurate snapshot of the entire mind-brain state of human subjects, which
    can then be transmitted nearly instantaneously to a new clone, essentially allowing
    the subject to maintain the thread of consciousness through the death of the old
    body and into the new one, cheating death. The operation must be correctly timed,
    however, with a margin of error rarely exceeding a few nanoseconds. This is because
    the process of scanning is extremely disruptive of the brain\u2019s delicate structures,
    essentially destroying the very brain it records.\n\nThe burning scanner raises
    the very problem of full mindbody cloning that the capsule solves. Since the scanner
    and its support systems are housed in a bank of equipment which requires close
    and stable proximity to the brain, it is in no way possible to wear the technology
    on one\u2019s person. Mounting the equipment in vehicles and even flight decks
    is problematic as well, since the scanner needs to fire within a precise window
    of time, right at the subject\u2019s death. False stimuli, momentary separation
    from the equipment, or accidents that can take place in unsealed environments
    are all problems that can cause misfiring of the scanner. Firing too early can
    cause grave psychological problems or even corrupted scans, as certain brain region
    activity disrupts the proper functioning of the scan. Firing too late similarly
    has its problems. Scanning a brain that is too far in the process of dying will
    result in a mind state record that is essentially brain damaged. At worst, it
    will result in an inert mind reduced to nothing more than autonomic functionality.\n\nThe
    hydrostatic capsule provides a nearly ideal solution to the problems posed by
    the transneural burning scanner. In the first place, it is a sealed environment
    with a very clear set of tolerances and breach parameters. If the capsule breaches
    without the proper authorizations, the system assumes a catastrophic situation
    and instantly administers a nanotoxin that produces a reliable death process in
    the pilot. The burning scanner can therefore safely operate within the precise
    window required. Moreover, the scanner can and has been successfully integrated
    into capsule systems to take advantage of its power, data storage, and FTL communications
    capabilities.\n\nFollowing the success of the capsule-clone integration tests,
    the decision was made to license qualified individuals as independent capsule
    pilots with associated clone contracts and access to capsule technology. The capsuleers,
    beneficiaries of the union of two remarkable and intersecting complexes of technology,
    had emerged. There followed a great boom in space technology and industry, rapid
    expansion of cloning facilities, and a large program of FTL communications web
    enhancement via the New Eden star gate network, as the empires vied with one another
    to support and attract this new class of spacefaring immortal."

    pilot candidates are a rare breed. Only 14 percent of all those who apply are
    able to make it past prescreening into basic training, and only around 5 percent
    of those manage to make it through the entire program and go on to become capsuleers.
    Prospective candidates must satisfy a broad range of criteria, including but not
    limited to: 20/20 vision, perfect hearing, blood pressure within a highly limited
    range, peak physical conditioning (able to run at least 60 kilometers without
    pause), a complete genome profile that excludes any possibility of genetic defects
    or hereditary disease, ninety-eighth percentile intelligence, a degree in a sufficiently
    advanced technical field, and, provided no grants or scholarships are in the picture,
    an enormous amount of money. Above all, the candidate must possess an ability
    to keep his mind working along several different tracks at once, giving full attention
    to all of them simultaneously.\n\nOnce past prescreening, a candidate is given
    a thorough grounding in capsule and cloning technology, as well as the specifics
    of what sets a capsule-fitted starship apart from a traditional, bridge-commanded
    vessel. He learns how to manage crews on varying sizes of ship, how to conduct
    basic maintenance, and myriad other tricks of the trade. The length of this book-learning
    phase varies between schools, though it is never less than one full year and very
    seldom more than two. The period culminates in a six-hour-long oral exam, during
    which the candidate\u2019s depth of knowledge is assessed, as well as his ability
    to think on his feet and respond to unexpected sets of variables. Regardless of
    how well a candidate has been doing up until this point, if he does not convince
    his instructor beyond the shadow of a doubt that his knowledge is bulletproof,
    he will be failed out of the program and sent home.\n\nOnce the initial academic
    phase is over, a two-year period of grueling physical orientation begins. After
    being fitted with the requisite implants for capsule interfacing (and provided
    their bodies don\u2019t outright reject the implants), prospects are subjected
    to days upon end of deprivation tanks, zero-G environments, and shock simulations
    intended to acclimate the body and mind to the rigors of travel through warp tunnels
    and wormholes. This, by far, is the training phase where the largest proportion
    of candidates fail out of the program.\n\nMost of the ones that do simply cannot
    tolerate the constant barrage of physical pain and conditioning, interspersed
    with the interminable periods of sensory deprivation. About to lose their sanity
    or patience or both, they sign their own termination slips. Some refuse to give
    up, but are not rewarded for their persistence: this phase of training has the
    highest mortality rate of the entire program. Exact numbers are not available,
    but it is estimated that roughly a tenth of all candidates lose their lives at
    some point in this phase.\n\nFor the few who manage to make it through orientation,
    the learning can begin in earnest. The last two years of the program are devoted
    exclusively to developing the skills needed to be an effective pilot, including
    hardpoint configuration, warp mechanics, shield system operation, signature analysis,
    astrometrics, and a host of associated skills. For the first of these two years,
    candidates will fly solely in simulations; for the second year, they are finally
    allowed to fly their first capsule-fitted frigates.\n\nOnce a candidate makes
    it through the entire five years of mental and physical hardship and exertion,
    he is ready to face the final test: in order to gain his certification and become
    a full-fledged capsuleer, he must submit to voluntary euthanasia, give up the
    body he was born in, and clone into a new version of himself, for the first time
    coming squarely face to face with death. Despite the prodigious investment of
    time and energy the preceding years have demanded, it\u2019s surprising to note
    how many candidates cannot make this final step, forgoing all they\u2019ve learned
    because they can\u2019t bear to cross the Rubicon into posthumanity.\n\nFor the
    others, their journey is just beginning."

- body: "## Capsuleer Professions\n\nWhether fresh out of an academy or a grizzled
    veteran, a capsuleer has a skill set that is always in high demand, with a tremendous
    variety of work available. Here is a breakdown of a few fields where capsuleers
    can commonly be found.\n\n### Trader\n![Capsuleer Trader](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/4OKkG68wjYi24tJA24qsoC/46647688ff7fed19c2779ca54edaf863/Professions_traders_screenshot.png#left)\nIn
    a cluster filled with demigods killing each other in endless cycles, it is not
    often that one gives thought to the humble trader. Yet a blaster cannot be fired
    without a charge and a mercenary isn\u2019t going to do much good without his
    drop suit. The humble trader, so often forgotten by those who deal only in death,
    perhaps holds more power than all of them combined. Without the trader, goods
    would never be moved from one place to another, the markets would be bare, and
    the economy would collapse.\n\nTraders bridge manufacturers and consumers, making
    sure goods are available to people across the cluster, and yet they are often
    forgotten when discussions are raised concerning the economics of the galaxy.
    Many of them prefer it this way, content to make their billions in relative obscurity
    while others risk their lives for comparatively meager rewards.\n\nAt its core,
    trading involves buying goods at a low price and selling them at a high price.
    These goods might be minerals, weapons, or even ships. A trader\u2019s work can
    be as simple as setting up a buy order a few thousand ISK below the market value,
    waiting for it to be filled, then listing it for what it\u2019s worth. Taking
    it a few steps further, traders may move their goods from a busy trade hub where
    prices are low to a slower one where prices are at a premium.\n\nBut trading can
    be a much more complicated and involved vocation than many might think. While
    at its simplest, trading involves buying goods in one hub and moving them to another,
    the actual act of trading is much more of a science, especially at its highest
    levels. Traders must constantly be on top of local needs and demands, often anticipating
    situations before they fully develop. Intelligence gathering can play a vital
    role, so the consummate trader must keep her ears open to all sorts of rumors
    which might sway purchasing trends.\n\nMany traders have made a killing by listening
    to rumors from R&D corps, plying researchers for news of unannounced breakthroughs
    which might suddenly turn an unappreciated ship into a hot seller. Banking on
    this insider info, the trader might buy up a heap of ships at low cost and then
    mark them up, beating the manufacturers to the market and turning a hefty profit
    for only a few hours\u2019 work.\n\nOthers have heard rumors of war breaking out,
    or of a new offensive by one of the capsuleer militias, and hauled a large store
    of ships and weapons into a burgeoning war zone. After a few days of fighting,
    when the choice lies between either traveling twenty jumps to the nearest hub
    or buying for a mild markup locally, the combatants will generally snap up what\u2019s
    available and line the trader\u2019s pockets.\n\nTraders may even find themselves
    privy to the comings and goings of alliances. If a large alliance is about to
    interdict a particular resource, the wise trader will stockpile it, wait for the
    interdiction to hit its height, and then dump her goods into a starved market.\n\nOf
    course, not every trader is a simple purveyor of goods who takes advantage of
    supply and demand dynamics. Many operate outside the realm of what is strictly
    legal. New Eden has a thriving black market for all sorts of goods, some of which
    are heavily regulated by CONCORD and the empires. Getting these goods from place
    to place is accomplished by skilled border runners who operate in fast moving,
    hardto- catch ships. Often ducking into dangerous, low security space, they risk
    life and limb for massive paydays when their illicit wares reach the waiting hands
    of greedy consumers.\n\nMuch of the criminal underground is built around the booster
    market. Boosters, a form of narcotic drug, are consumed throughout New Eden by
    the rich and impoverished alike. Whether the drugs are taken recreationally, to
    combat inner demons, or simply to feed an addiction, drug mules and pushers move
    them across the cluster in search of profit. Considering many of the harder drugs
    can be used to manufacture neural boosters, which can vastly improve a capsuleer\u2019s
    combat capabilities, the rewards for venturing toward the seedier side of the
    profession can be great.\n\nDespite seeming to be a fairly safe occupation on
    the whole, trading can earn a person a host of enemies. Manipulation of markets
    using flipped goods can quickly lead to the wrong types of attention from both
    the authorities and other traders. More than one war has been started by a trader
    attempting to move into another\u2019s territory and not knowing when to back
    down.\n\n### Manufacturer\n![Capsuleer Manufacturer](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/3bcMRLvLPkzWCf0aN1QaUo/79a896e7b20a4971599d495de875be4c/professions_manufacturers3.png#left)\nThe
    builders are the shakers. Nothing comes from nothing. Each and every ship, module,
    drone, and even round of ammo was created by someone, somewhere. Whether it was
    a lone entrepreneur mining his own minerals to build his standard laser crystals
    or the head of a hundred-person industrial chain churning out every flavor of
    Tech II ship, the manufacturer is the backbone of both New Eden\u2019s vibrant
    economy and its bloody battles.\n\nThousands of ships are destroyed in New Eden
    every day and these ships need to be replaced. Manufacturers diligently toil to
    make sure that if an ill-fated destroyer explodes in one corner of the cluster,
    there will always be another available. The vocation often suits those who are
    not eager to engage in combat and are looking for a more passive lifestyle.\n\nManufacturing,
    at least that which occurs on scales capsuleers care about, occurs almost entirely
    in space. The ore is mined there and transported to stations, where it is refined
    into minerals, which are then hammered, shaped, alloyed, molded, and formed into
    complete products in huge factories.\n\nAny and all goods can be manufactured
    in these factories. Using advanced robotics, they can take an input of minerals
    and output a fully functional spaceship a few hours or days later. They accomplish
    this feat through the use of blueprints, special code that programs the robots
    to manufacture every piece down to the last atom. Of course, skilled researchers
    can increase the speed and efficiency of their blueprints with proper research,
    allowing them to use up fewer resources and accomplish their tasks in a fraction
    of the time.\n\nOf course, there are a limited number of factories in each station
    and the most popular systems will quickly find all their slots constantly occupied.
    This forces manufacturers to slowly disperse into outer systems, where conflict
    is much more rife. For those who live out in the dangerous areas of nullsec or
    wormhole space, assembly arrays can be attached to star bases for the manufacture
    of most ships, modules, and ammo. Naturally, these are often prime targets for
    enemies who can cripple a corporation\u2019s supply chain, particularly if it
    is a capital ship assembly array in the process of building a Titan or a supercarrier.\n\nWhile
    there exist numerous manufacturers of mundane goods in New Eden, they are typically
    restricted to the large, faction-aligned corporations that service the trillions
    of baseline citizens of the empires. Those who run in capsuleer circles focus
    primarily on engines of death and destruction: ships, modules, and ammo.\n\nThe
    simplest manufacturers are those who work on a single blueprint and churn out
    low-cost bulk goods that are widely consumed. Capsuleers can eat through hundreds
    of thousands of rounds of ammo in a single day, and a skilled manufacturer with
    a well-researched blueprint can turn a steady, if small, profit by simply filling
    this need. But this is no path to prosperity. The top echelon of manufacturers
    have a diverse portfolio of blueprints which can produce a variety of top-end
    goods.\n\nSometimes they may own the majority of blueprints in the cluster, allowing
    them to effectively corner the market on certain ships or modules and thus set
    their own prices. Of course, there are times when a pesky upstart will do some
    research and development and invent a blueprint of his own that allows him to
    muscle in on the action, but that\u2019s why a good manufacturer does not stick
    to one product. To be specialized is to lack adaptability, and when a competitor
    who is better at exploiting a niche arrives, those who are too reliant on a small
    pool of blueprints can quickly find themselves pushed out of the market.\n\nEconomic
    warfare of this sort is almost as bloody as the most devastating military conflicts
    in New Eden. Trillions of ISK can be lost as manufacturers try to undercut each
    other, hire mercenaries to drive their competitors out of the market, commit espionage
    and sabotage, and wind up sending each other spiraling into ruin. While the explosions
    may not be as flashy and the names are not as well known to the general populace,
    the rise and fall of manufacturing empires can be every bit as dramatic as the
    fates of their military counterparts.\n\n### Bounty Hunter\n![Capsuleer Bounty
    Hunter](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/3FpVAOoKGgWY4ZA0cQFykp/32832becdc73cf506c8f873be68e7a1b/professions_bountyhunter.png#left)\nIt\u2019s
    easy to make enemies in New Eden, but it\u2019s not always possible to personally
    deal with those who have wronged you. That\u2019s why bounties are so prevalent
    among the denizens of deep space. Place a price on a person\u2019s head, and sooner
    or later a bounty hunter will come to collect. When that enemy is a capsuleer,
    things can get tricky.\n\nWhen someone is able to die repeatedly, the old adage
    \u201CWanted: Dead or Alive\u201D is rendered somewhat meaningless. Kill a pod
    pilot and she\u2019ll simply wake up safe in a clone vat dozens of jumps away.
    Additionally, pod pilots are infinitely more dangerous than their non-capsule-fitted
    counterparts, able to take out great numbers of ships and cause untold collateral
    damage in both lives and money. For this reason, hunting capsuleers is a domain
    almost exclusively inhabited by other capsuleers. But it is a life fraught with
    peril. A bounty hunter rarely acts alone, as even the ugliest monsters of the
    cluster have friends.\n\nNew Eden is a big place, and as such contains plenty
    of places to hide. Tracking down someone with a large bounty can be a difficult
    task, but capsuleers are resourceful in all things. Some of the most tapped-in
    individuals across the cluster are the various agents working on behalf of the
    empires\u2019 corporations. A few of them are willing to call in favors and locate
    a person for a price.\n\nOf course, the cleverest capsuleers can find other ways
    to track down their prey. Many capsuleer organizations keep publicly viewable
    records of the destruction their pilots engage in, and using that information,
    a smart bounty hunter can figure out when and where a bounty target is going to
    be lurking. A little more research can turn up a list of the targets\u2019 associates,
    what sorts of ships they\u2019re likely to pilot and when, and even the most common
    tactics they employ against their enemies.\n\nIn an effort to avoid capsuleers
    collecting bounties on themselves, CONCORD will only pay out a portion of a bounty
    directly proportional to the value of the destroyed ship. Therefore, if a bounty
    target is destroyed in a small frigate with inexpensive equipment, the reward
    will only be a small amount, even if he has a billion-ISK bounty on his head.\n\nAmong
    bounty hunters, there\u2019s a thin line between the law and the lawless. Though
    many come into the profession with dreams of making New Eden a better place by
    removing the scum of the world, experience soon teaches them that the realities
    are not so black and white. The biggest bounties aren\u2019t always placed on
    the worst criminals. Instead, they wind up collecting on the heads of innocents
    who just happened to rub enough bad people the wrong way. Sure, they may be annoying
    or even despicable, but often they\u2019ve broken no laws. Sometimes they\u2019ve
    done nothing wrong besides being abrasive.\n\nAdditionally, the hunters can often
    find themselves the hunted, with massive bounties placed on their own heads by
    the people they\u2019ve tracked down and killed for profit, sometimes over and
    over. The smart bounty hunter will know how to turn this to her own advantage,
    luring other bounty hunters to their doom.\n\nThose who entered the business with
    idealistic minds can quickly find their morals eroded. Bounty hunting becomes
    less about tracking down criminals and meting out justice, and more about collecting
    money from whoever is willing to pay it. For some, it devolves into simply killing
    for the sake of doing so. Indeed, through either avarice or sudden circumstance,
    bounty hunters commonly find themselves sitting in the role of the villain they
    once hunted, unsure of how exactly they got there.\n\n### Pirate\n![Capsuleer
    Pirate](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/pCI0DVoCEEjJe3Qfv2Xu2/495035b1c6974a7fde7ba453e1a48454/professions_piracy_screenshot.png#left)\nSome
    of the most well-known and influential capsuleer outlaws, upon graduation from
    their respective naval academies, immediately abscond to the border regions to
    begin plying their trade. Many have formed their own gangs, corporations, and
    coalitions over the last decade, with a number of pilots rising to celebrity status
    due to their audacious and highly illegal antics.\n\nThe rise of this breed of
    pirates began immediately with the commercial release of reliable capsule technology,
    which has been adopted by most pirate groups as protection for key pilots vital
    to operations and leadership.\n\nSince YC 105, piracy has taken on many forms.
    From the early sorties and blockades of star gates in the systems of Mara and
    Passari to loosely organized groups harassing trade routes on the borders of the
    Great Wildlands region, pirate operations have left no area of New Eden untouched
    over the last decade.\n\nThe early years of piracy saw fast gangs of frigates
    and cruisers stage raids into both high-security empire space and alliance-controlled
    areas of nullsec before larger and more highly organized pirate corporations began
    to emerge, some with hundreds of capsuleers flying their colors. Smuggling also
    tends to be a profession favored by the capsuleer elite, with hundreds of billions
    in illicit cargo crossing borders across New Eden every month.\n\nWith the further
    advancement of starship technology in recent years and the public release of blueprints
    for Capitaland Supercapital-class hull designs, some of the larger organizations
    have risen to great notoriety, claiming and holding their own space or contracting
    themselves out as mercenaries to assault heavily fortified territories of capsuleer
    alliances competing with their contractors.\n\nWhile the vast majority of capsuleers
    form allegiances to their own organizations, there are a notable number who choose
    to fly in support of the largest pirate cartels in New Eden, subcontracting themselves
    as guns for hire and effectively acting as long-term mercenaries. Quite often
    these individuals and their organizations are taken under the wing of the major
    cartels and offered work from their agents."
