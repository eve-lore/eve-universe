    The Serpentis Corporation is a cutting-edge research, development, and manufacturing
    corporation specializing in biochemistry and the production and distribution of
    high-technology pharmaceuticals. To put it more bluntly, Serpentis is one of the
    foremost manufacturers and smugglers of illegal drugs in New Eden. Concentrating
    primarily on the lucrative Gallente Federation market, Serpentis networks ship
    neural boosters and other drugs across the cluster in vast quantities every day.
    As a major source of illegal drugs and the crime associated with them, the Serpentis
    are high on the priority list of criminal organizations monitored by law enforcement
    in New Eden.


    While Serpentis networks uncovered in the core empires are more or less readily
    dealt with by the authorities, the one advantage that the Serpentis Corporation
    holds over many other drug syndicates is its control of the Phoenix constellation
    of systems in the outer region of Fountain. Over the years, the Serpentis have
    established many subsidiary facilities and installations in neighboring regions
    and the hidden folds of deadspace. Their alliance with the Angel Cartel has brought
    them both additional security and a foothold in the Curse region, where they have
    many manufacturing and storage stations. From their well-protected bases in nullsec
    space, the Serpentis are able to control a large portion of the illegal booster
    market with little concern for the forces of law and order.'

- body: "## History\n\nIn the early days following the development of the first neural
    boosters, many perfectly legal corporations researched and manufactured these
    new \u201Cwonder drugs,\u201D hoping to build a fortune on their promise. Unfortunately
    for these companies, and for more than a few early adopters, it soon became clear
    that prolonged use of the new drugs could have bizarre and often fatal side effects.
    The core empires quickly moved to ban almost all neural booster drugs, at a stroke
    driving this lucrative new market underground. At the time, one of the smaller
    booster research firms, named Sarpatis, was owned by a Gallente biochemist named
    Igil Sarpati. The Sarpatis Corporation was contracted by the Gallente Federation
    to investigate the potential for neural booster use in their military. When the
    Federation Senate later banned boosters, Sarpatis quickly collapsed, sharing the
    fate of almost all other companies that had invested in the booster trade. Not
    long after the company closed down, Igil Sarpati died. Suddenly leaderless, his
    family looked set for obscurity and relative poverty.\n\nThe Sarpati story might
    have ended there had it not been for the drive and determination of Igil\u2019s
    adopted child, Virge Salvador Sarpati. Of Caldari parentage, the young Sarpati
    became the head of the family after his father\u2019s untimely death. The collapse
    of his father\u2019s company, and the worsening of the family\u2019s circumstances
    that followed, marked the young Sarpati for life. Evidently the youth endured
    much mockery from his contemporaries, but the experience only fired his determination
    to restore the Sarpati family fortune. Preferring the name V. Salvador Sarpati,
    and with a talent for business, the new head of the Sarpati family was eventually
    able to found his own company. Taking an old form of the family name, he called
    it the Serpentis Corporation. Sarpati knew that research and development could
    be lucrative fields so long as the work were sufficiently diversified to limit
    the risks. Over time, he maneuvered the Serpentis Corporation into a leadership
    position in the field of space colonization and industrialization technologies.
    In an echo of his father\u2019s work, space medicine became a particular field
    of interest to the young executive, and thus by proxy to his corporation\u2019s
    large R&D division.\n\nThe Serpentis Corporation necessarily began life as a Gallente
    Federation\u2013based company, but even by Gallente standards it possessed a very
    cosmopolitan character from its first days. Due to the way his father had been
    treated and his early experiences in Gallente society, Sarpati became increasingly
    antagonistic toward the Gallente Federation, and as his corporation grew, his
    disdain for the Gallente reached a point where he allowed only Caldari corporations
    and officials access to the higher echelons of his organization. In the end, Sarpati
    decided on a total break with the federation and began to look for ways to escape
    the limits of Gallente law.\n\nAt the beginning of YC 75, Sarpati settled on a
    plan. He acquired a system in the Phoenix constellation and named it Serpentis
    Prime. Rapidly building an advanced space station, he transferred his core operations
    to Serpentis Prime and began to expand his research ventures into forbidden territories.
    Part of Sarpati\u2019s strategy was to open his station to the inhabitants of
    the Fountain region, earning their support and favor. That many of these locals
    were criminals and outright pirates was of little concern to him. Once he had
    established himself, it is believed that he retrieved his father\u2019s old neural
    booster formulas from the family archives and turned his research facilities over
    to working on them. The Serpentis Corporation was now set on a path that would
    lead it well beyond the confines of the law.\n\nSalvador Sarpati took a great
    risk when he opened his station to outlaws and pirates, but he made sure to get
    his corporation powerful protection. In an extraordinary and dangerous move, he
    struck a deal with the notorious Angel Cartel for protection of his station and
    facilities. In return the Angels would get a cut of Serpentis trade and access
    to any research breakthroughs the Serpentis Corporation made. As the Serpentis
    operation expanded, the Angels expanded their protection force. Over time, this
    deal has been so lucrative for the Angels that they have found it worth building
    an entire division, the Guardian Angels, dedicated to protecting Serpentis space.
    With the help of the Angel Cartel, the Serpentis developed their own security
    forces, with Salvador Sarpati eventually able to command a powerful navy in his
    own right.\n\nWhile Sarpati\u2019s fortunes have steadily risen over the decades
    since he founded Serpentis, the effort has not been without setbacks. CONCORD\u2019s
    Directive Enforcement Department considers Serpentis vessels fair game and offers
    large bounties for their destruction. The law enforcement agencies of the Gallente
    Federation are particularly concerned about combating the Serpentis drug-smuggling
    and money-laundering operations in their jurisdiction. As an outlawed organization,
    the Serpentis Corporation is often the target of other nullsec factions or capsuleer
    groups. In YC 106, for instance, the Mordu\u2019s Legion mercenary corporation
    raided Serpentis Prime and is speculated to have escaped with data on several
    prototype technologies being researched by Sarpati\u2019s scientists.\n\nV. Salvador
    Sarpati was well established as a foe of the Gallente federation by YC 107, but
    even the keenest Serpentis watchers were startled by his hijacking of one of the
    Federation\u2019s Soltueur-class Titans in May of that year. Personally leading
    a Serpentis strike force, Sarpati successfully boarded the FNS Molyneux before
    flying it on a long journey back to Serpentis Prime. The incident, notable enough
    to begin with, is remembered for the large involvement of capsuleer forces attempting
    to both help and hinder Sarpati and his escort fleet as they escaped toward Fountain.
    Reaching Serpentis Prime successfully, Sarpati was able to call on reinforcements
    that covered the hijacked Titan\u2019s retreat into the security of Serpentis
    docking facilities. The daring operation shocked the Gallente Federation and served
    as a reminder of the lengths to which Sarpati was willing to go to harm the empire
    he held responsible for his father\u2019s decline.\n\nWith its power and military
    capability increasing, in YC 108 the Serpentis Corporation judged the time ripe
    to stage a takeover of the Outer Ring Excavations (ORE) conglomerate. A series
    of carefully planned operations in the first quarter of the year culminated in
    the capitulation of ORE in April YC 108. The federation, seeing yet another expansion
    of Serpentis influence in the outer regions close on Gallente space, reacted by
    warning the Serpentis not to expand any further toward their regions. CONCORD
    itself considered the threat so dire as to back the federation\u2019s position
    with promises that deadly force would be used against any Serpentis attempt to
    encroach on Gallente space.\n\nThe Serpentis were evidently little cowed by words
    alone, and in September YC 108 they staged another raid on federation dockyards,
    this time stealing a Nyx-class supercarrier from the Federation Navy. This hijacking
    did not go as well as that of the Molyneux, and while the supercarrier was successfully
    jumped to nearby nullsec, capsuleers swiftly tracked and destroyed it. Even so,
    a significant federation asset had been lost, and the fact that the theft had
    been carried out in Luminaire\u2014home system of the Gallente and the cultural
    heart of the federation\u2014only served to add insult to the injury. Sarpati,
    as usual, reveled in both the discomfiture of the Gallente and the fillip to his
    notoriety.\n\nThe Gallente Federation responded to the audacity of the Serpentis
    by stepping up its patrols and interceptions, and scored some successes against
    drug shipments in the following years. Serpentis vessels running under false flags
    and illicit transshipment points were raided with increasing frequency. In some
    cases the fight against the Serpentisbacked drug trade revealed their use of other
    organizations, either through infiltration or in criminal partnership. The affair
    of the designer drug called \u201CRise\u201D and the Illoren organization revealed
    Serpentis schemes within Intaki society in the federation, perhaps aided by their
    sometime associates in the Intaki Syndicate. The interest in corrupting the Intaki
    appeared to be confirmed when it was found that Serpentis enforcers regularly
    made use of the Aenebra, an Intaki \u201Cdeath cult\u201D notorious for combining
    drugs, rituals, and assassination in its activities. Once again, it seemed, V.
    Salvador Sarpati was working his long-term plans against the federation.\n\nWith
    many of his operations disrupted and several schemes exposed, Sarpati evidently
    chose discretion over escalation, and for some years now there has been a lull
    in overt Serpentis activity, particularly in terms of grand heists, military raids,
    and the like. That said, despite the entry of capsuleers into the neural boosters
    market, and a limited legalization of the weaker forms of the drugs, Sarpati\u2019s
    core business of drug manufacturing and supply has continued with little interruption.
    The market for his products is vast, and the people of the Gallente federation
    are prosperous enough, in the main, to afford his tempting and addictive offerings.
    The question today is what Sarpati will do next. No one doubts that the man called
    \u201CThe Snake\u201D still hates the Federation, and the Gallente authorities
    continue to maintain a vigilant watch over the Serpentis sphere of influence."

    its origins a Gallente corporation, the Serpentis organization still retains a
    certain family resemblance to the many large and perfectly legal corporations
    that operate across New Eden. It is, as a fact, part of the corporate culture
    of the Serpentis that everyone within the organization behaves, at least outwardly,
    as if it is just another research and development conglomerate. It is standard
    for Serpentis executives to express shock and vigorous reproach if anyone so much
    as suggests that the corporation is a criminal organization involved in drug smuggling
    and racketeering on a grand scale. This peculiar play-acting, carried on by people
    who clearly know what they are about, takes place at every level of the Serpentis
    Corporation. Whether it is an aid to indoctrination or merely one of Salvador
    Sarpati\u2019s sardonic jokes is unclear. Given the byzantine mind of Sarpati,
    it is very likely a little bit of both.\n\nThe veneer of legitimate corporate
    culture practiced by the Serpentis is accompanied by a deep organizational devotion
    to free market principles and meritocratic advancement. It is, on the one hand,
    quite acceptable to discreetly bribe your way into a desired position, but if
    you are incapable of fulfilling the new role, your contract is likely to be terminated,
    a circumstance that in the Serpentis Corporation is very definitely final. Those
    who earn their place by enhancing the profits of the Serpentis Corporation are
    infinitely more secure. A line is drawn very clearly at disruptive means of advancement.
    Sabotage or murder of colleagues is strictly forbidden and will usually be grounds
    for dismissal. Very few risk the consequences and those that do very rarely profit
    from their ill-judged actions.\n\nConversely, the rewards for merited advancement
    in the Serpentis Corporation are very high. The corporation ensures that even
    low-level workers are at the very least comfortable and well paid. Managers can
    expect a very high standard of living, and the upper executives live in luxury
    every bit as lavish as a Gallente corporate exec enjoys. V. Salvador Sarpati himself
    has gathered a varied and multitalented retinue about him. The most frivolous
    of them live with him in the Serpentis Prime system. There they spend their days
    in idle games and frolics without a worry in the world. Sarpati himself is an
    active participant, although his boundless energy and ambition always draw him
    back to his schemes and his empire. The more determined members of the inner circle
    are scattered across the Serpentis stations in Fountain and Curse, helping to
    run the Serpentis Corporation according to Sarpati\u2019s wishes. In many cases,
    the ultimate goal of a member of the Serpentis is to one day enter Sarpati\u2019s
    retinue.\n\nPerhaps inevitably, use of drugs and neural boosters for recreational
    purposes, and more besides, is a significant aspect of Serpentis culture. While
    Sarpati does not enforce any kind of no-users policy on his drug empire\u2019s
    employees, he does insist that use of his products be in due moderation and not
    impair the efficiency of his organization. Woe betide anyone who fails in their
    allotted tasks due to drug intoxication or a booster-invoked seizure on the job.
    Sarpati enjoys seeing his staff take their share in the rewards of the drug business,
    but he has no patience for fools who lose themselves in a narcotic haze. Another
    side, arguably darker still, to the drug culture of the Serpentis is the extensive
    use of combat boosters and psychoactive drugs by the security and military divisions
    of the organization. Serpentis security troops are feared not only for their efficiency
    and ruthlessness but also, perhaps primarily, because they commonly have all human
    emotion drugged out of their systems.\n\nIn many respects the Serpentis exhibit
    a mix of Caldari efficiency, Gallente curiosity, and Minmatar determination in
    much that they do. The only major cultural influence that is given short shrift
    by the Serpentis is the Amarr, with their ever-present religiosity. Sarpati himself
    considers religion a trap for the mind, and his disdain is reflected in the attitudes
    of his people. The Serpentis will happily stoop to using religion as a tool, as
    they have on several occasions in the service of peddling their pharmaceutical
    wares, but they have nothing but contempt for the religious habit of mind."

- body: "## Structure and Leadership\n\nThe leadership of the Serpentis Corporation
    is unambiguously vested in the person of V. Salvador Sarpati. As the founder,
    guiding light, and public face of Serpentis, Sarpati can be said to embody the
    organization in all its aspects. Even the Blood Raider Covenant\u2019s Omir Sarikusa
    does not quite achieve the level of identification with his organization that
    Sarpati has made sure to maintain with the Serpentis Corporation.\n\nFor the enemies
    of Serpentis, the elimination of Sarpati is at the top of the list of measures
    they would like to be able to take against the organization. It is possible, indeed,
    that if this were ever achieved, Serpentis might just collapse. The prospect seems
    unlikely, however. Sarpati\u2019s transhuman status is unclear, but most believe
    that he is a capsuleer or, at the very least, has cloned and backed himself up
    to such an extent that assassination is practically impossible.\n\nSuch is the
    genius of Sarpati, and so admired are his achievements and intellect within Serpentis,
    that, for the organization\u2019s executives, managers, scientists, workers, and
    fighters, there is only one leader that matters: V. Salvador Sarpati. Even so,
    Serpentis is a large organization, and using the corporate model, Sarpati has
    ensured that there is competent direction at every level of his empire.\n\n###
    Serpentis Corporation\n\nAt the core of Serpentis operations is the corporation
    that V. Salvador Sarpati built to redeem the fortunes of his adoptive family.
    Ostensibly a research and development outfit gone rogue, the Serpentis Corporation
    oversees research, manufacture, and distribution of a myriad of illegal drugs
    and narcotics. In the main, Sarpati has chosen to keep the different activities
    that the Serpentis are involved in under the single roof of the Serpentis Corporation.
    The corporation therefore has large security and logistics divisions within its
    structure, as well as many research and industrial sections dedicated to various
    products. Secure in its Fountain and Curse stations, the Serpentis Corporation
    does little to hide the nature of those products. To be sure, the Serpentis are
    no strangers to clandestine activity, and the corporation\u2019s distribution
    arm\u2019s pilots are masters at the black arts of smuggling.\n\n### Serpentis
    Inquest\n\nAn exception to Salvador Sarpati\u2019s preference for organizing all
    activity under the Serpentis Corporation umbrella, Serpentis Inquest is believed
    to be exclusively focused on research into areas other than the pharmaceutical
    concerns of its parent company. The rumors hold that Inquest\u2019s research ranges
    from forbidden AI experiments, through black cyberimplants, and on to alternative
    methods of cloning and consciousness transfer. CONCORD appears to believe that
    Serpentis Inquest certainly has an interest in implant and cloning technology,
    but for the rest it makes no comment. The staff of Serpentis Inquest, so far as
    anyone can determine, never leave the corporation\u2019s single research station
    orbiting the first moon of Serpentis Prime VI. It is certain that nobody, whether
    in the Serpentis organization or in interstellar law enforcement, has any interest
    in talking about anything that would force a confrontation in the Phoenix constellation.\n\n###
    Shadow Serpentis\n\nWhile the Serpentis Corporation still relies heavily on the
    Angel Cartel for military aid and protection, the forces of Serpentis are by no
    means to be dismissed. While often seen working hand in glove with the Guardian
    Angels, the Serpentis military carries out its own operations with the efficiency
    and ruthlessness demanded by Salvador Sarpati. The commanders and elite fighters
    of the Serpentis fleets are known as the Shadow Serpentis. Rumored to take a cocktail
    of combat drugs that deaden their emotions and heighten their aggression, the
    Shadows are justly feared throughout the Serpentis sphere of influence."

- body: "## Notable Characters\n\n### V. Salvador Sarpati\n\nThe evil genius, as some
    would say, at the top of the Serpentis organization, Virge Salvador Sarpati founded
    the corporation and built it into the drug empire of today with absolute devotion.
    Preferring to be known as \u201CV. Salvador Sarpati,\u201D the leader of Serpentis
    is sometimes referred to as \u201CThe Snake,\u201D though never in his hearing
    and only by enemies and the most daring of his servants. Truth be told, while
    he keeps up an appearance of disliking the nickname, Sarpati takes a rather perverse
    pleasure in it. Near-obsessive preoccupations with long-term schemes and mysterious
    research projects, and his ever-present hatred of the Gallente Federation, are
    key to understanding Sarpati. Nevertheless, the health and prosperity of the Serpentis
    Corporation remain his chief concerns, all else being a means to an end for this
    enigmatic crime lord.\n\n### Igil Sarpati\n\nThe beloved adoptive father of V.
    Salvador Sarpati, Igil was a brilliant Gallente biochemist who founded a startup
    company specializing in neural boosters. His timing proved poor, and within only
    a few years the Gallente Federation, in common with the other core empires, had
    banned the new class of drugs due to deleterious and often fatal side effects.
    The Sarpatis company collapsed and with it began the decline of Igil Sarpati.
    He died relatively young\u2014Salvador believed this was due to his broken spirit\u2014and
    left his adopted son, Virge Salvador, as head of the Sarpati family. If there
    is one man that Sarpati still honors, it is his gentle and inquiring, long-dead
    father.\n\n### Santimona Sarpati\n\nWhile Salvador Sarpati\u2019s adoptive family
    are a key part of his retinue, one member of the Sarpati house, his sister Santimona,
    has rejected an idle life of privilege in Serpentis Prime, along with Salvador\u2019s
    criminal and underworld activities. As a high-ranking member of the Servant Sisters
    of EVE, Santimona mocks her brother and his criminal lifestyle at every opportunity,
    calling him the \u201CKing Serpent\u201D and Serpentis Prime his \u201Croyal court.\u201D
    For his part, Salvador returns her contempt, calling her devotion to the sisters
    a \u201Cmeaningless collapse into quasi-religious sentimentality.\u201D Privately,
    Sarpati knows that the Sisters are not to be underestimated and he is careful
    to keep an eye on the activities of his estranged adoptive sibling.\n\n### Silphy
    en Diabel\n\nWhile by no means a member of the Serpentis organization, Silphy
    en Diabel is a useful ally for Sarpati, as her control of the Intaki Syndicate
    guarantees its friendly relationship with his organization. The two are old acquaintances,
    en Diabel originally coming to the attention of Salvador due to the friendship
    she once had with Santimona Sarpati. When Silphy later achieved control of the
    Intaki Syndicate with Sisters of EVE\u2019s aid, Sarpati saw an opportunity to
    establish a useful business relationship, while at the same time putting one over
    on his sister. Silphy en Diabel readily agreed to Sarpati\u2019s proposal that
    the Intaki Syndicate and Serpentis Corporation collaborate in their efforts to
    control the Gallente Federation black market. The two organizations mutually profited;
    when, as it inevitably had to, the partnership emerged into public view, the Sisters
    of EVE and Santimona turned their backs on Silphy en Diabel. Once again, the Snake\u2019s
    schemes had come to fruition.\n\n### Tuvan Orth\n\nTuvan Orth is a trusted commander
    in Serpentis and is responsible for the internal security of the organization.
    Orth took part in the hijacking of the Gallente Soltueur-class Titan FNS Molyneux
    in YC 107. He is possibly the most wanted man in the Serpentis Corporation, next
    to Sarpati himself. He is reputed to be fearless and, unlike many Serpentis fighters,
    eschews combat drugs. Orth is known to be exceedingly arrogant and almost as egotistical
    as his master. Remarkably, by all accounts the two men get on very well with one
    another. It is considered likely that Tuvan Orth is a capsuleer, but there is
    no clear evidence for this.\n\n### Fazin Oorund\n\nFazin Oorund played a key role
    in the Serpentis takeover of the ORE conglomerate in YC 108, providing Serpentis
    forces with intelligence and access from his position as an ORE station administrator.
    For his efforts, the traitor was appointed the position of lord admiral in the
    Serpentis forces and assigned the role of liaison between the Serpentis Corporation
    and ORE operations. He is not a popular figure within either Serpentis or ORE.\n"
