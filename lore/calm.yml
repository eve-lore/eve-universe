- body: '**"Calm"** is the name given to a [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) torturer.
    Neat and prim, his movements are gentle and precise, his posture straight yet
    at ease. He is someone who is in full control of himself and takes quiet pride
    in his work.


    He introduced an array of horrific tools before pushing an iron nail into [Sebastian''s](5XvDRS1t6l5P9mK4ycTU6S)
    right eye.
