- body: '**Dam-Torsad** is the Imperial City of the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo).

    Which is located in the northern hemisphere on

    [Amarr Prime](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4), situated on

    [Amarr Island](4wZzhhUMIfR4ziHGaMOiLJ), and made up of several

    districts, like for example

    [Torsad-Laur](2w4NAgugzCIUNDLfeIk0C8). It has walls that have been

    described as "oppressive" by [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) ambassador

    [Yanou Lautere](5IsiBXSZHsr1GKxBJXsO61). The core of the city is generally

    considered more similar to a monument to past glories than a modern

    metropolis. The [Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) and Privy

    Council continue to rule and hold full

    meetings from the city, though in the age of space travel, it is as

    often as not that the Emperor will not even be present.


    One thing that is true of almost all people on Dam-Torsad is that they

    share a great general tendency to stay in direct active communion with

    one another while in public, chanting, praying, or speaking loudly and

    at great length. The environment of Dam-Torsad encourages this behavior

    in both subtle and unsubtle ways, through pray-drones, billboards, and

    other disruptive phenomena designed to habitually reinforce preference

    for communion.
