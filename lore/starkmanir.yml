    tribe. They were thought lost in the [Minmatar Rebellion](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N),
    until just prior to the Elder War when the [Sisters of EVE](77ihwsVRHRojCaPC5XZn2g)
    announced they had discovered remnants of the tribe within the [Ammatar Mandate](4BV4ldw5RdVB4FxKctn4J6).\n\n###
    Culture\n\nThe Starkmanir are one of the oldest of the Minmatar tribes, and their
    access to abundant, readily-accessible resources meant that they were traditionally
    the largest as well. Despite this, due to the combined factors of the Starkmanir
    resettling on a planet subsequently destroyed, and the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
    tendency to eradicate the culture of the people it conquers, less is known about
    Starkmanir society than any other tribe.\n\nThe Starkmanir's origin in the vast
    Eyniletti plains of [Matar's](5gheCRHTWLbi5jzbo5vvT6) equatorial region is plainly
    visible even today in their almond-shaped eyes. Beyond that they appear very much
    like slightly smaller, darker, [Brutor](5xBrtZyeYfTxWkZTO1o5zg), and it is probably
    this trait that allowed the [Nefantar](1lfEcB4SdrV3EJIrmYWOK2) to successfully
    hide the remnants of the tribe for so long. \n\nCurrently in the Republic, they
    are viewed by some as simply a symbol of hope, while others just view them as
    backward or deluded by the Amarr faith. They struggle to come to terms with a
    foreign identity that they feel has suddenly been thrust upon them, while they
    try to make the transition from slaves to free citizens. The fact that many of
    the Starkmanir hold on to their Amarr faith isn't making their integration to
    the Republic any\nsmoother."

- body: "## History\n\nThe Starkmanir have perhaps the most tragic history of all
    the Minmatar tribes, though it is a tragedy tempered by their survival and return
    to the Minmatar worlds despite having been thought extinct until quite recently.
    The Starkmanir tribe are known to have been one of the largest tribes in the early
    history of the Minmatar and apparently tended toward peace and neutrality, even
    during the warring tribes phase of Minmatar history. The dominant yet stable and
    peaceful position of the Starkmanir in the fertile Eyniletti Plains region of
    Matar made them a particularly important cultural influence on the other tribes
    that traded with them. The Starkmanir tribe is also notable for being the mother
    tribe of two splinter clans that went on to become major tribes in their own right:
    the Brutor and the Vherokior.\n\n### Origins and Splinter Tribes\n\nThe Starkmanir
    are one of the oldest tribes from Matar, and while their origins are lost in the
    mists of time, the earliest records of the Starkmanir tribe lie in the oral histories
    of two of their splinter tribes.\n\nThousands of years ago, a Starkmanir clan
    crossed the Mioar Strait and started settling the islands in the Mioar archipelago.
    Their reason for doing so is now lost, but moving ever southwards into the island-strewn
    southern hemisphere of Matar, this clan eventually lost contact with the rest
    of the Starkmanir Tribe. These people came to form a separate tribe in their own
    right, and they named themselves Brutor.\n\nIt was also around this time that
    a chief of one of the remaining clans began causing trouble. Questioning many
    of the traditions and decisions of the tribe's elders, he was eventually sent
    into exile. Many of his clan followed him on an exodus into the Greater Sobaki
    Desert. The conditions on Matar ensured that the all of the tribes continued to
    grow at an increasing rate, and in a matter of centuries the push for habitable
    land meant contact was reestablished with these people. \n\nThey returned to the
    fold of the Minmatar tribes after six hundred years in the desert, much changed
    in manners and appearance, though their Starkmanir ancestry was still clear in
    their distinctive, almond-shaped eyes. Calling themselves [Vherokior](6VDPzsKX9TVbVtXEwjj0RB),
    they began roaming between the other tribes in large caravans much like the [Thukker](3uoxvtJY1Z30BoVwuJLj2z),
    living as merchants, healers, scholars, and fortune tellers.\n\nIt was during
    this period of substantial growth that the tribes began to come into conflict
    with each other. The [Krusual](7KI9OEieV9sdjksayCyoGk) and Nefantar in particular
    were at each others throats, and the other tribes tended to fall on one side or
    the other. Most of the Brutor tribe supported the Nefantar, but enough supported
    the Krusual to cause severe internal strife. The Starkmanir were the exception
    as they remained neutral throughout the conflict. When the tribal wars ended the
    Minmatar knew nothing but peace until the arrival of the Amarr. During this period,
    the Starkmanir Tribe's size, age, and neutrality in the wars, ensured they were
    a strong voice on Matar. \n\n### Minmatar Empire\n\nThe Starkmanir played a leading
    role in the establishment of a global peace and subsequently the foundation of
    the Minmatar Empire. Despite the [Sebiestor's](1fNour0sFTIcCFRVQM2pro) critical
    role in the development of space technology, the Starkmanir maintained the strongest
    influence among the Minmatar as they entered their Space Age. When the Matari
    made their way into space, the Starkmanir were keenly involved in the exploration
    and colonization efforts that followed. \n\nIndeed, the Starkmanir were inspired
    by the prospect of founding a new world to such an extent that the entire tribe
    migrated from Matar to the second planet of the [Arzad](3GU5GnnzvXqLbJNLd2Otoi)
    system, naming it Starkman Prime. It seems clear that the Starkmanir had begun
    to find the pressures of increased population in the hospitable and increasingly
    developed plains region unpleasant. Not ones to cause conflict, the Starkmanir
    simply gifted their lands to the other tribes and relocated to a new world they
    could make their own.\n\n### Amarr Raids and Occupation\n\nThe Amarr slave raids
    against the Minmatar largely bypassed Starkman Prime until the Amarr invasion
    and occupation of Matar had been completed. During the intervening century or
    so that the Amarr raided Matar, many of the relatively few Starkmanir that had
    stayed behind on Matar took what transport they could find to Starkman Prime.
    Isolated groups of Starkmanir remained on Matar, but almost all the tribe were
    on their new home world when the Amarr decided to invade the Arzad system and
    enslave its inhabitants. The [Imperial Navy](3PKvXZS0iHKIgAmO9np74g) invasion
    forces were met with little resistance by the ill-prepared Starkmanir: aside from
    their peaceful nature, the Starkman economy had been destabilized by refugees
    from other Matari worlds and was incapable of effectively supporting a defense
    of the planet.\n\nThe relative ease with which Starkman Prime had been taken and
    the clearly pacific nature of the Starkmanir led many Amarr to believe that the
    tribe would be more receptive to assimilation into the Amarr faith than the more
    unruly tribes of Matar. Indeed, the Amarr came to believe that the Starkman resistance,
    such as it was, had been stirred up by refugees and rebels from the other tribes.
    This was not entirely true, but the idea led some Amarr to consider that a gentler
    approach could work with the Starkmanir. The Amarr also appear to have considered
    the Starkmanir a very handsome people, and it is quite likely, given Amarr cultural
    concepts, that this influenced them to look favorably on the tribe.\n\n### Faith
    and Rebellion\n\nFor a time, the Starkmanir did adjust themselves peacefully to
    Amarr rule and took up the Amarr faith in great numbers. This initially pleased
    the Amarr, but their religious authorities became concerned over time that the
    Starkmanir were practicing a heretical version of the religion. A suppression
    of the Starkmanir interpretation of the faith was ordered, and their liberal Amarr
    holder, Arzad Hamri, was executed and replaced with the orthodox Arkon Ardishapur,
    a royal heir of the Amarr Empire. \n\nThe Starkmanir reaction to these events
    was as surprising as it was passionate: rising up in [rebellion](6zCt6sjhgwfu6uZ0iEIC8K),
    the Starkmanir killed Arkon Ardishapur and caused chaos across the planet. The
    Amarr were shocked that the Starkmanir \u2014 seemingly their most promising and
    devoted converts among the Minmatar \u2014 could carry out such acts, and Arkon\u2019s
    son Idonis responded by ordering a sustained orbital bombardment of Starkman Prime.
    The devastating rain of tachyon siege laser fire reduced the temperate colony
    world to a barren wasteland. The Starkmanir living on the planet were annihilated,
    the entire tribe paying the ultimate price for rebellion.\n\nThe annihilation
    of the Starkmanir arguably lit the long fuse leading to the Great Rebellion 250
    years later. The Amarr were at pains to point to Starkman Prime as a demonstration
    of the fate of rebels. The Minmatar were no longer in any doubt that they would
    have to fight if ever they hoped to gain their freedom. The Starkmanir were considered
    lost for centuries until the discovery of a viable surviving population hidden
    on Halturzhan, a planet in the Ammatar Mandate. \n\n### Rebirth\n\nThe Sisters
    of EVE announcement of the discovery surviving members of the Starkmanir may have
    been the prime motivating factor that saw the Elder Fleet spring into action.
    Rescued from Halturzhan along with other slaves, the surviving Starkmanir were
    returned to the Minmatar Republic. A large group of the Nefantar tribe also returned
    to the Republic after their ancestors' true motives for defecting became\nknown.
    The return of these people to the Republic along with the normal war zone refugees,
    at a time that also saw the Thukkers returning to the fold, put significant strain
    on the Republic. Refugee camps sprouted up all over [The Great Wildlands](great-wildlands)
    and 'intake' systems such as Rens as members of the three tribes awaited entry.\n\nFor
    generations the Starkmanir had known only a life of [slavery](slavery) in the
    Ammatar Mandate, living a relatively backward existence on vast agricultural colonies
    and for the greatest part unaware of their heritage. Though the Starkmanir survive
    genetically, in every other way the tribe was truly lost on Starkman Prime. With
    no prior experience in the modern age, nor with tribal structure, nor even with
    their own heritage, the Starkmanir do not figure to regain their former influence
    among the Minmatar Tribes for some time to come.\n\nThe discovery of the long
    lost Starkmanir tribe spurred the Minmatar Elder Fleet into an early invasion
    of Amarr territories with a view to recovering the Starkmanir and as many other
    slaves as possible. This attack, necessitating the neutralization of CONCORD,
    began the conflict known as the Empyrean War."
