- body: '**Beliah** is a student at [Republic University](5MIk5pq00NX5NDS9mcLcpv)
    whose time was mostly spent with the political and sociology students discussing
    revolution. Young, idealistic, and passionate, she admired [Karin Midular](3KxlNVAeglPj5ZH0sf3U2j)
    but felt, as her friends did, that [Maleatu Shakor](3H5EVyO9kiyIUOEELIqOlV) should
    be leader.


    When she discovered her mother was dating an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) she
    ran to her favorite hiding place, the roof of their building. Her surrogate Grandmother,
    Gran, tracked her down and explained how Beliah''s mother was a [Daughter of the
    Revolution](5cNK0teHN5X2tixANHvsmg) and what that means.

    Beliah, who Gran calls ''Little Bird'', left the roof with a more balanced view.
