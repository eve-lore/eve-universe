    the first of June, King [Khanid II](5HlA8KgFOuLy4jTf3t54xf) departed\nTash-Murkon
    Prime with the [Khanid Royal 1st Fleet](nQJFwBFQzGij9cZKKCrm7) and arrived shortly
    thereafter in\nthe [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) system. Following on his week
    spent with\nthe [Royal Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) [Catiz Tash-Murkon](5sw0sEytwzlBUbKWdiisUI),
    events appeared to be moving\naccording to a careful diplomatic plan. The next
    day,\n[Empress](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) [Jamyl I](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L)\nmet
    with Khanid II in the Imperial city of\n[Dam-Torsad](UI6KVmdCZ0H42EvHijFVZ), with
    this being the first time in\n500 years that the Khanid leader had set\nfoot on
    [Amarr Prime](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4). In the hallowed precincts\nof the holy city,
    the Empress summoned all Royal Heirs of the Amarr\nEmpire to an extraordinary
    session of the full [Privy Council](privy-council). As the last occasion that
    a full\nmeeting in person of the Privy Council, had preceded the coronation of\nEmpress
    Jamyl I herself, and given the rarity of such meetings, it was\nclear that significant
    developments in the politics and diplomacy of the\nAmarr Empire were in the offing.\n\nAfter
    several days of closed meetings, the Royal Heir [Yonis Ardishapur](4Tb1Uk75SycuFuiizODkZD)
    was reported to have abruptly\ndeparted the Privy Council's deliberations, apparently
    to tend to \"vital\nmatters\" within the Ardishapur domains. While there was some
    speculation\nas to this unusual absence from the ongoing meeting, the [Ardishapur
    Family](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO) issued an official statement to\nthe effect that
    Arim Ardishapur was speaking \"with the full authority of\nthe Ardishapur Family\"
    at the meeting and claimed that \"the Empress\nhad given full permission for Lord
    Ardishapur to leave the meeting.\"\n\nWhatever the reason for Ardishapur's departure,
    the Heir was to return\nthe next day and join with the Empress and other Privy
    Council members\nas Empress Jamyl I made another of the surprising announcements
    that\nwere fast becoming the hallmark of her reign. Addressing the Amarr\nEmpire
    from the steps of the Imperial Palace in Dam-Torsad, the Empress\nannounced that
    the Khanid Kingdom and the Amarr Empire were now once\nmore unified, with the
    Khanid region designated as a \"Kingdom of the\nEmpire\" to be ruled in the name
    of \"Holy Amarr\" by Khanid II.\n\nAs a mark of this union and the return of Khanid
    II to the imperial\nfold, the Empress granted [House Khanid](1dQRsN9IAaCTVkatH4haam)
    a\nseat on the Privy Council in perpetuity. A diplomatic and political deal\nof
    some subtlety, the new union between the Empire and Kingdom left the\nright of
    Jamyl I to rule as Empress of Amarr without challenge while\nensuring the autonomy
    and independence of Khanid II's territories within\nthe imperial framework. One
    notable point was that the Khanid seat on\nthe Privy Council did not bring with
    it Royal Heir status, possibly a\ncompromise necessary to secure the agreement
    of the Royal Heirs to the\nextraordinary rapprochement with a man once reviled
    within the Empire as\na traitor, heretic and renegade.\n\nReactions to the new
    unity of the Amarr Empire and Khanid Kingdom were\nin many ways as would be expected.
    [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy)\ncommentators saw the formal reconciliation
    as a highly positive step\nwhich could prove to be a profitable opportunity for
    Caldari\ncorporations with links to both the Kingdom and the Empire. In the\n[Gallente
    Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK), academics and other\nobservers of interstellar
    politics saw it as a worrying development that\ncould only strengthen the Amarr-Caldari
    axis and lead to increased\nexchange of technology and intelligence between the
    Amarr, Khanid and\nCaldari. Most voices among the [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp)
    political\nand military establishment tended to dismiss the new unity as \"business\nas
    usual,\" pointing out that the Amarr and Khanid had long collaborated\nagainst
    Minmatar interests. However some, like the Gallente, highlighted\nthe increased
    potential for locking the Caldari into an anti-Minmatar\nalliance due to their
    strong links with the Khanid.\n\nCaldari Military and Militia\n----------------------------\n\n
    In the Caldari State\nitself, military matters loomed large in the news. A serious
    incident\nthe previous month, involving the destruction of civilian convoy in\nUphallant
    system by [Internal Security](3F5YslD2GfQXvpQPq3EGui),\n[Nugoeihuvi's](4Ykng1Buej1uH3Sy5ln3jW)
    security arm, had\nhighlighted problems with communication and co-ordination in
    the Caldari\noccupied zone of Gallente systems. The [Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN)
    had subsequently been reported as\nover-stretched and finding it difficult to
    adequately patrol the vast\nnew territories under their control. These factors
    gave new impetus to\nthe Caldari Providence\nDirectorate's military\nreform proposals
    in mid-June.\n\nIn particular, the embarrassing incident involving Nugoeihuvi's
    Internal\nSecurity paramilitary force had led the other Practical faction\nmegacorps,
    [CBD](7o6AuVZhnq4lIzIMdYdMft) and\n[Sukuuvestaa](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB), to back
    away from\ntheir previously strong support for NOH's opposition to the reforms.
    The\nPatriot bloc of megacorporations were also reported to be hoping to\nappeal
    to [Ishukone](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI) CEO Mens Reppola's\nloyalty to the Caldari
    Navy as a means to overcome his own objections to\nProvist policy in this area.
    With Caldari State Executor [Tibus Heth](6E1MZyo3l7DscBmmOdp7KG) awarding the
    entire Caldari [State Protectorate](2VlyV0CDyxFv0Qg3N3dW8k) militia with the\nDistinguished
    Blade, a national medal of recognition for their\nsuccessful offensive against
    the Gallente, it was certainly true that\nthe Provists could make a strong case
    for the Caldari military being\nsafe under their policies.\n\nCORPS\n-----\n\nOne
    other notable event at the end of June was the decision by\n[CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt)
    to release the first declassified CONCORD\nOuter Region Political Summary (CORPS)
    briefing to the public GalNet.\nCORPS had been a regular bi-monthly declassified
    report produced by the\nDirective Enforcement Department ([DED](1xZoOUsqaDhJw7gQffHMFC))
    for Assembly\nheads of state, internal watch commanders and diplomats for some
    time.\nIt release, planned to continue as the norm in future, appeared to be\npart
    of a new transparency and publicity drive by an organization that\nhad seemed
    somewhat sidelined since the start of militia warfare between\nthe core empires.\n"
