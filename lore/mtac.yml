- body: '**MTACs (Mechanized Torso-Actuated Chassis)** are metal exoskeletons

    used for heavy duty mining work. They are armed with mining lasers and

    can be remote controlled or worn by miners.


    MTACs make for effective emergency weapons in combat, as they are heavy,

    virtually immune to anti-personnel laser weapons, and have large,

    dangerous claws. Some have surface cling abilities that allow them to

    maneuver in zero gravity.
