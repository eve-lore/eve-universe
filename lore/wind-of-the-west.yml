    spirits.


    Wind-of-the-West comes from the Great Western Sea of [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i),
    and he is seen as the Wind which

    carries the rain to the homelands of the Caldari. The presence of

    Wind-of-the-West is seen in fog and gentle rains, and in the tang of

    salt air. A guardian of the waters, Winds-of-the-West was venerated

    highly by sailors and all along the west coast of the Raata Empire; in

    Caldari folklore, Winds-of-the-West not only taught the Caldari to sail

    but the ways of trade as well, making him second only to Cold Wind in

    the minds of modern Caldari.


    Other divine entities include [Mountain Wind](NEtuLo38zgFK9ZA0sGYCk), [Cold Wind](16iSgSK58hOq8DIlx2oqKS),

    [Heart-of-the-Forest](3zH6qMixgVJtQUgHF3KFFM), and [Storm Wind](vAU7b4dGGPGQNp6QRw6mX).
