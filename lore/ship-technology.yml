    of modern times, which is no small matter considering what else has been invented
    in the world of [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk).\n\nGeneral\n-------\n\n-   [Capsules](capsule)
    are the core of modern [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) technology.\n-   [Rigs](rigs)
    are a multipurpose technology designed to push ships beyond their initial designs.\n\nTypes
    and Designs\n-----------------\n\nThere are multiple types of vessels, ranging
    from lowly shuttles to small frigates, all the way through bulky industrials slowly
    roaming through space, up to large fighting vessels such as battlecrusers, battleships
    and the almighty titans. Each of them has their own specific design, purpose and
    use.\n\n-   [Frigates](6FJmBYuBTwDdtiiH8kIHsA) are small and cheap, on the interstellar
    scale, at least.\n-   [Interceptors](5tDUsKRPyntVMgukOtqMaY) are a special frigate
    class intended for fast pursuit and tackling.\n-   [Assault Frigates](1KYMoqBHSO5kh9oW5YTRWS)
    are designed around firepower and survivability.\n-   [Electronic Attack Ships](30ATTxuqHH2UjqvSqb3JGc)
    are fast and agile frigates that focus on electronic warfare.\n-   [Destroyers](1ZGRFdhUUSkZE3cebI0Air)
    aim to destroy things, hopefully smaller frigates, but not so much larger cruisers.\n-
    \  [Cruisers](3wE5sDRggwgYjiExdCRyL0) are mid-sized ships that fill a variety
    of specialized roles.\n-   [Industrials](oPGFihhst5FK2rjcaxUsx) are our interstellar
    haulers.\n-   The [Iteron](6fG7HxreLY12wHaw6hOY9G)-class cargo transport is cheap,
    fast, reliable and adaptable\n-   The [Iteron Mark IV - Quafe Ultra Edition](5bqDU1ifvbhSQM1VjGyhLU)
    is a special, caffeine-fuelled version.\n-   [Battlecruisers](battlecruisers)
    fill the size and firepower gap between cruisers and battleships.\n-   [Battleships](vEsIuJJVnWWgEJ5JKZif7)
    are the largest sub-capital ships in New Eden.\n-   [Marauders](4BTaZWhSPDignZcoVUIR3w)
    are a subclass designed for long-term stays in hostile environments without logistics
    support.\n-   [CD-1](4vbefypiPcUrQTXwD6UTlv) is a specialized battleship.\n-   A
    modified [Isogen-5 Abaddon](YOZhANdRLftwFSfeEMzG3) was glimpsed ferrying destructive
    cargo.\n -   The [Dam-Imud](1RiKpOIhjCFnO7WFCGbRsq) was an Apocalypse-class battleship.\n-
    \  [Titans](XH5ZPvSBGGIStAEWqWHOl) are as much mobile [space stations](space-stations)
    as ships.\n-   The [Jovian Mothership](6XzKsKxV7dwE9QAm5cLNVQ) was a terrifying
    vessel that dictated the outcome of one of New Eden's  most notorious battles.\n-
    \  [Orbital bombers](2DkDo7hofFa5A9hWWPmXEc) were used in the Gallente-Caldari
    War.\n-   [Project Skymother](56jHURaqYy9SzmHignb3Wz) was a historical development
    in starship engineering.\n-   [Single-man fighters](2zJdxBu7hlAbyrhkl5sLou) were
    the Caldari answer to Gallente bombers.\n-   [Mining barges](mining-barge) can
    tear through asteroids in a short time.\n\nPropulsion and Travel\n---------------------\n\nShips
    are able not only to drift through space - a grand feat in the history of any
    civilization - but withstand and maintain immense speeds, camera drones in tow,
    that may at times appear to violate some of the most fundamental laws of physics.
    They may rush down warp tunnels, disappear through wormholes, and be shunted through
    stargates.\n\n-   [Fractal acceleration shell capacitors](1KeIiC16V0gDygL6JYhA0E)
    are a part of starship engines.\n-   [Ship sensors](3DZ5KHi9SjRTCfJHAXvO4n) are
    a necessity for travelling through dark space.\n-   [Stargates](416pCzXGIwn2Tt7feZYSpk)
    render interstellar travel possible for ships lacking jumpdrives.\n-   [Warp drives](7o1BhmhKqoA32WfmkW8Yqt)
    allow for speedy travel within the limits of a solar system.\n-   A [warp tunnel](1N9cUs5FItibjtzKy50sol)
    is a visual phenomenon coincidental of warp drive operation.\n-   The [micro jump
    drive](micro-jump-drive) was to be a major advancement in instantaneous travel,
    right up until the point where it instantaneously put someone in a place they
    very much shouldn't have been.\n\nCombat\n------\n\nThose magnificent vessels,
    created through amazing feats of science and engineering, may drift through the
    skies, shunt between impossible distances and assist in the transport of innumerable
    people and objects. This being [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk), mind, they're
    probably going to spend most of their time firing at one another. This may involve
    defensive combat - boosting, tanking and remote boosting - indirect combat - drones,
    ECMs, smartbombs - or simply direct, unequivocal combat, in the form of guns and
    missiles. It also includes how they detect friends and foes.\n\n-   An [ancillary
    shield booster](ancillary-shield-booster) is vital for those occasions where you're
    caught with your shield down.\n-   [Military drones](5TesdXq5to62CrbIBuPXxS) see
    great use, particularly among the [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK).\n-   The
    [Vampire](27nbX6dou9OiDPjbGAcm05) was an exceedingly dangerous - and costly -
    prototype combat drone.\n-   The [Target Spectrum Breaker](target-spectrum-breaker)
    can cancel targeting locks against the ship they are fitted to.\n\nMining and
    Other Ancillary Functions\n------------------------------------\n\nShips aren't
    just vessels for mining and hauling. They may engage in covert ops, for any number
    of purposes, or loot the wreckage of those unfortunates who found themselves in
    the way.\n\n-   The [drone damage amplifier](drone-damage-amplifier) improves
    the damage output of combat drones.\n-   [Salvage drones](4f8tIhuLBPHJsyPiIW8iwu)
    come in handy after a firefight.\n-   [Salvage modules](salvage-modules) can be
    used for cargo retrieval.\n-   [Warp scramblers](4uAflvhPRUB2142ZCg8hmw) keep
    target ships from escaping.\n\nInternal Functions\n------------------\n\nCapsuleers
    control some aspects of ship operations, and can even push their vessels into
    overdrive when necessity calls.\n\nBeyond that, though, operation of space vessels
    is a complex and tricky endeavor that requires the combined efforts of often large
    groups of experienced people.\n\nSo ships have crews, and some concessions need
    to be made to their comfort and well-being onboard their respective vessels. Those
    crews are thankfully not lost when the ships are - well, not all of them, at least
    - and thus can build up the experience needed to run the various internal systems
    that are either unreachable by or beyond the interest of capsuleers to focus on.\n\n-
    \  [Fedos](5vXRRw5WFv0cu5OUhLKBtE) are used on many ships, mainly [Minmatar](3VbZNIqcUMjhZ8dlSFN8f1),
    as a cheap organic waste disposal and cleaning system. Ships that employ fedos
    usually have a special nursery where female fedos are kept in a controlled environment
    to breed due to the very short life cycle of a fedo.\n-   A [ship crew](3XUeMME0mskbriwkDeYNHs)
    is necessary, believe it or not, for the successful flight of most interstellar
    vessels.\n-   [Viewing halls](TW9QsmXwueb9TjXxIPyHz) are omnipresent on ships.\n\nSee
