- body: '**The Electric Museum** is a station-based institution funded by the

    [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) megacorps that displays previous

    technological advancements by the Caldari, focusing primarily on ship

    modules. The museum is free to enter, though it has some ticketed

    special sections.


    The main area of the museum has modules protected under glass with

    [holoprojectors](3R2yaSdkUb08ifof3FfTZd) that give text information

    on the modules. The museum has an option for the blind that allows them

    to touch the module as the information is read out to them.


    A special section of the museum has modules that are sitting unprotected

    on pedestals, though they are not supposed to be touched by visitors.

    These modules are all from [Kaalakiota Corporation](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK) and
    [Sukuuvestaa Corporation](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB) and are the result of

    a forbidden affair between [David](3H01yyv6huJ5QjGhvOP55j), the former CEO of

    KK, and [Yonate](6EWutHvfhZLE0KAKiJdTNM), the former CFO of SuVee.


    [Entrye Chrare](2M6na4iZkeZ4GqtRcpR2xK) is an aged curator of the

    museum who gives guided tours. [Ruebin](46Sf8a6drmXcf4cWZGYlTw) visited once

    and joined up with one of Entrye''s tours, staying after for a private

    discussion of the exhibits.
