    [Holder](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v).


    Following the ascension of [Empress](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) [Jamyl I](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L),
    he berated her in a fiery speech in open court.

    Following his outburst, the assembly dispersed into chaos, Orsha was

    denounced by his own family, and he was judged and found guilty of

    heresy.


    Normally he would have been put to death, but Jamyl spared him. Instead,

    she stripped him of all rank and privilege and offered him life on two

    conditions: First, he had to retire to a convent, where he would study

    the [Scriptures](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp) for the rest of his life, and

    second, he would have his entire body painfully tattooed with excerpts

    from the Scriptures, interspersed with the names of his children and

    grandchildren.
