    [EVE Gate](2z1KQXUVtPP1WmlwcJaX4o) and the reemergence of the empires onto

    the galactic stage.


    These times are shrouded in mystery. It is known that the EVE Gate

    wormhole closure led to a collapse of civilization. During these cold

    and deadly times, settlements floundered and died off, and those few who

    managed to survive did so in starving desperation.


    There does exist some evidence that new societies arose and even that

    they achieved levels of technology that are breathtaking even to present

    time citizens of New Eden. How these ancient races lived, progressed and

    died, however, is unknown. We encounter their relics from time to time,

    and look at them in mystification.


    Eventually they, too, disappeared, as all things do; and New Eden lay

    quiet.'
