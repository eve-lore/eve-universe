    The 6th Alliance Tournament came to an end in\nearly February, with Pandemic Legion
    defeating R.U.R. alliance in a\nthrilling final match between the latter's Caracal
    Navy Issues and\nAbaddon team and Pandemic's Vexor Navy Issue and\n[Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp)
    command ship squad. Having already\ndefeated the defending champions of Ev0ke
    alliance in the semi-finals,\ntheir victory in the final saw Pandemic Legion crowned
    Alliance\nChampions for the first time after a history of strong showings in\nprevious
    tournaments.\n\nThe continuing war with the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK)\nand
    the occupation of [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i)\ncontinued to be sources
    of contention throughout the month. The\n[Wiyrkomi Peace Corps](tdQPTaCTtXveoZlyNTHQs),
    the security\narm of the patriot faction [Wiyrkomi Corporation](66psXtrftjRzA7MyKHtb7K),
    announced it was sending\nan additional full brigade of troops to take part in
    the occupation of\nthe [Caldari's](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) original homeworld.
    This highlighted\nthe involvement of a number of corporate security troop forces
    belonging\nto such megacorporations as\n[Kaalakiota](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK), [Lai
    Dai Corporation](5k5GiWRlFceyTjLSz71XT) and Wiyrkomi alongside [Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN)
    marines and\nProvist troops on Caldari\nPrime. The Wiyrkomi deployment was considered
    to mark a shift away from\nsuch corporate forces working mainly as defense forces
    around assets\nseized by megacorps toward being contract troops answering to the\nCaldari
    provisional government on the planet.\n\nIshukone Contendors Speak\n-------------------------\n\nWhile
    patriot corporations such as Wiyrkomi continued to be unstinting\nin their support
    of the occupation and general war effort, [Ishukone Watch](21GQBhNgawJQQ39wqVX4yU)
    CEO Mens Reppola spoke out on the\nsubject of the occupation on the political
    talk show *Games of State*.\nReferring to the recent report on the costs of occupation,
    Reppola\ncharged that the occupation was \"a logistical nightmare ... draining\nthe
    resources of the State.\" The former Navy captain went on to point\nout that the
    Caldari Navy was conceived and organized as a defensive\nforce that could not
    sustain an offensive of [the Scope](2XUuFn5Lte67YYxmxj86Yt) and length of the
    occupation and the\ncontinuing war against the Gallente Federation. With his candidacy
    for\nthe [Ishukone Corporation](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI) chief\nexecutive seat
    now well-known, Reppola also spoke of the importance of\nsolving problems in the
    interests of employees and the State itself,\nemphasizing that this had been the
    approach of the late Ishukone CEO\n[Otro Gariushi](5QydCJCoYvbvbWvFlAlbHg).\n\nMens
    Reppola had also been critical of the Caldari offensive in Verge\nVendor in his
    remarks on Games of State and the campaign in the region\nswiftly resulted in
    sky-rocketing insurance and shipping rates, driving\nmany freight companies and
    independent pilots away from the region. In\nother shipping news, a crippled Iteron-class\n[industrial](oPGFihhst5FK2rjcaxUsx)
    vessel was discovered burned out in\nspace with all hands lost in the Caslemon
    system, Essence region.\nMystery surrounded the vessel's fate and its purposes,
    with no public\nrecords of its cargo or destination available, until a [Federation
    Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1) statement was issued confirming the\nship had been
    contracted by the Navy to relocate military equipment. The\nstatement also revealed
    that an investigation had concluded that the\nship had been destroyed by demolition
    charges set inside the vessel\nafter its cargo had been stolen. The Federation
    Navy blamed the Caldari\nfor this raid but questions were raised as to why there
    had been no\nnaval escort.\n\n[Minedrill](2cjgnHBuWiKY7pH2xjzvG0) CEO Soisonen
    Okalala, a candidate for\nthe Ishukone CEO spot, used an appearance on *This is
    The State* to\nrespond to fellow candidate Mens Reppola's remarks on the occupation
    of\nCaldari Prime and the course of the war against the Gallente Federation.\nOkalala
    suggested that the report on the costs of the occupation was too\nnarrowly-focused
    and did not balance the costs against the gains. The\nMinedrill CEO also congratulated
    the [State Protectorate](2VlyV0CDyxFv0Qg3N3dW8k) for its efforts in Verge\nVendor
    and expressed support for the approach of State Executor [Tibus Heth](6E1MZyo3l7DscBmmOdp7KG)
    with regard to the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) and the economic agreement
    with them. These\nlast remarks were perhaps a response to criticisms from within
    the State\nover an agreement between the mining conglomerate [Ducia Foundry](6sCdhoug6FOa0zTTypjzvd)
    and the [State and Region Bank](26XJchU8cSXHX1wWooavzA) securing 50bn ISK of financing\nfor
    the Amarr corporation.\n\nCorporate Disputes\n------------------\n\nHeightened
    and at times contentious activity between Caldari\ncorporations seemed to be a
    feature of the month's events, with\n[Hyasyoda Corporation](WisddAsk7hie3SUcwiNwa)
    walking out of\nnegotiations with [Zainou](4bKBzWAifvRRbnXs3i9ZnE) over a supply\ncontract,
    Minedrill and [Top Down](5D3Z7xo3S9krERwyH9WHFT) Retail entering\ninto a partnership
    to develop new mining technology and [Caldari Business Tribunal](32Y4no5DBn6kGO5HnWuYgH)
    investigators\nraiding Ishukone Corporation's offices in Oimmo system. This last\nincident
    proved to be embarrassing for the Caldari Providence\nDirectorate, which had prompted
    the CBT to take the action and sent its\nown troops to participate in the investigators'
    raid. Within the day,\nIshukone Watch made over 300 arrests among Ishukone personnel
    on charges\nof aiding piracy and corporate corruption throughout the Mito\nconstellation.\n\nApparently
    the result of a longstanding Watch investigation and\nsurveillance operation,
    the Ishukone security arm was forced to make its\nmove prematurely when the CBT/Provist
    raid interrupted its surveillance\nand alerted some targets of their operation.
    The Watch stated that\nalmost 50 suspects had eluded capture, among them some
    of the 'worst\noffenders.' When the Caldari Providence Directorate suit against\nIshukone
    Corporation went the the Tribunal's Regional Court it was\ndismissed, vindicating
    the position of Ishukone and leaving the Provists\nsorely disappointed. Ishukone
    chose to leave the matter there,\nrefraining from exercising its option of a countersuit
    over the\npremature raid and disruption to its business and that of Ishukone\nWatch's
    surveillance operation. More good press for Ishukone Watch CEO\nMens Reppola came
    when he intervened in the dispute between Hyasyoda and\nZainou to bring about
    a return to negotiations between the two\ncorporations.\n\nTreason and Salvation\n---------------------\n\nIn
    the Amarr Empire, news of the arrest of the [Ammatar Fleet](3as0Qu7kajUNvkjJdBSwF1)
    Grand Admiral Einkur Aro on the\norders of [Amarr Royal Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh)
    [Yonis Ardishapur](4Tb1Uk75SycuFuiizODkZD) shocked many across the\n[Ammatar Mandate](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz).
    The charges against Admiral Aro\nwere listed as dereliction of duty, failure to
    prevent mutiny and\ntreason. Speaking about his decision to order the arrest over
    six months\nafter the Elder Invasion exposed serious deficiencies in the Ammatar\nFleet
    and sparked widespread defections from its ranks, Yonis Ardishapur\nnoted that
    \"as the one in charge Grand Admiral Aro is totally\nresponsible for the failures
    and actions of his men.\" The action caused\nmuch disquiet within the ranks of
    the Ammatar Fleet, with many fearing a\ngeneral purge. On this the Royal Heir
    would only say that he had 'yet to\ndecide how deep the ineptitude in the Fleet
    runs.'\n\nIn Amarr itself, a charismatic former slave and cleric in the Salvation\nChurch
    of Blessed Servititude, [Abel Jarek](5HDj1enu8OW6rTNg6d9dR8),\ndeclared his intention
    to lead a \"Salvation Crusade\" from Amarr to\n[Pator](7MdCKy2OEJTpJSItRgx8DX),
    home system of the Minmatar. Accompanied by 214 Minmatar former\nslaves, Jarek
    left Amarr aboard a chartered transport and began to tour\naround Amarr systems
    picking up more former slaves to take part in his\n'crusade.' The Salvation Crusade
    ships were soon preparing to cross into\nMinmatar space where they would have
    to leave behind their House Sarum\nsecurity escort, the presence of which was
    an apparent sign of favor\nfrom the [Sarum Family](4EZ4a3Mw8QXHmisAA4Ff6L).\n\nCrossing
    into Minmatar space towards the middle of February, Abel\nJarek's small fleet
    of ships encountered several hostile vessels in Auga\nsystem. Mostly consisting
    of attack\n[frigates](6FJmBYuBTwDdtiiH8kIHsA) of the Rifter-class, the hostile\nfleet
    ordered the Salvation Crusaders to turn back into Amarr space\nafter halting Jarek's
    ship with a [warp disruptor](4uAflvhPRUB2142ZCg8hmw). Abel Jarek is believed to
    have\nimmediately refused this order but the stand-off was prevented from\ndescending
    into deadly violence by the arrival of Caldari mercenaries in\nseveral powerful
    ships, including three Cerberus-class missile cruisers\nand two Rook-class electronic
    warfare cruisers. These mercenaries jammed\nthe Minmatar frigates and escorted
    the Salvation Crusaders on their\njourney to [Pator](7MdCKy2OEJTpJSItRgx8DX) system.
    Arriving in the Minmatar\nhome system, Jarek and his followers landed on [Matar](5gheCRHTWLbi5jzbo5vvT6)\nand
    set up a camp in the largest refugee holding zone on the Minmatar\nhomeworld.\n\nEver
    since news of the\n'crusade' had reached the Minmatar Republic there had been
    much\ncontroversy and strong feelings of antipathy, as evidence by the\nunofficial
    attempt to halt Jarek at the border. However, as returning\nslaves claiming Republic
    citizenship, Jarek and his followers could not\nbe stopped by the Minmatar government
    despite the outrage their arrival\nand plan to build an Amarr chapel in the refugee
    camp caused. This\noutrage manifested itself in a number of violent arguments
    and minor\nscuffles when Jarek's followers ventured into the main camp to preach.\nThis
    hostility culminated in a major escalation when a several-hundred\nstrong group
    of rioters, apparently led by masked men directing the\ncrowd's actions, broke
    into the Salvation Crusade compound and burned\ntheir Amarr chapel down. The violence
    resulted in numerous injuries\namong Jarek's followers but there were no deaths.
    Complaints that the\nlocal police and fire services took too long to arrive were
    dismissed by\nthe Matar authorities. For his part, Abel Jarek was defiant and
    vowed to\n'continue to spread the word of God' among the Minmatar.\n\nTroubles
    in the Republic\n------------------------\n\nOther problems in the Minmatar Republic
    emerged in late February, with\nAidonis Medical - a medical and aid charity run
    by the [Aidonis Foundation](2ZdUwi6lEN75YZoamvXA72) - warning that food supplies
    to\nthe Republic were at risk due to shortages in Verge Vendor region caused\nby
    the ongoing Caldari offensive and consequent contraction of shipping\nvolumes.
    Added to this was increased tension over the issue of land in\nthe Minmatar Republic
    caused by a rising immigrant population and, in\nparticular, the return of the
    [Nefantar](1lfEcB4SdrV3EJIrmYWOK2) and\n[Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw) tribes.
    With members of both tribes\npressing claims to ancestral lands distributed to
    other parties or held\nby the Minmatar government in their absence a considerable
    increase in\nland disputes was reported by the Minmatar land and estates agency\n[Urban
    Management](wIqOeOMc7BHuJaMPwbe1M).\n"
