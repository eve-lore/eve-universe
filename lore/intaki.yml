- body: "The **Intaki** are a major bloodline within the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK)
    and one\nof its four founding members along with the Gallente, the\n[Mannar](4BaMCkOwYaPpd4ZMtEfEY)
    and the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy). Their\nhomeworld is the fifth planet
    of the [Intaki solar system](17xNygfKnuI4d0t0JHAU0Z),\nin the Viriette constellation
    of\nthe Placid region.\n\nJoining the Federation immediately after its founding,
    the Intaki remain\none of the largest ethnicities of the nation. Exceedingly gifted\ncommunicators,
    the Intaki are today very prominent among the Federal\nbureaucracy. Though Gallente
    culture has permeated their society to some\nextent, they still cling to their
    cultural identities and beliefs, most\nnotably their unusual theories regarding
    the human life cycle\\-in\nparticular, death and rebirth. These theories give
    them a unique outlook\non life and the living, and many attribute the Intaki's
    stoic nature to\nthis philosophy.\n\nBecause of political turmoil during the first\n[Gallente-Caldari
    War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV), a number of Intaki were forced\nout of the Federation,
    eventually forming what is now the\n[Intaki Syndicate](4DOTqrhXfEcWH1ygU05Vby).\n\nRacial
    Traits\n-------------\n\nThe Intaki male is methodical and reserved, never outspoken
    or\nconfrontational. He generally enjoys quiet reflection, and Intaki homes\nare
    traditionally places of peace and tranquility. The typical Intaki\nhas absolute
    control over his emotions and is able to remain calm even\nunder the most trying
    circumstances.\n\nLike their male counterparts, Intaki females are quiet and\ncontemplative,
    moving through the world seemingly without making a\nripple. Yet their contemplative
    manner often embraces great beauty\nthrough both physical and literary arts. A
    great number of the\nuniverse's most notable contemporary artists are of Intaki
    heritage, and\namong them a disproportionately large number are female.\n\nAncestry\n--------\n\n###
    Artist ancestry\n\nIt is widely believed that the introvert Intaki create the
    most stunning\nand thought-provoking art around. They've revolutionized many art-forms\nand
    created new, such as metapaints and touch sculpture. Intaki artists\nseem to have
    a unique ability to create and convey unparalleled beauty\nthat is universal for
    all human races.\n\n### Diplomats ancestry\n\nSince their inauguration into the
    Federation the Intaki have slowly\nestablished a reputation as superb diplomats,
    negotiators, and\nbureaucrats. In the tense and often violent world of [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk)\nthese
    qualities can be of vital\nimportance.\n\n### Reborn ancestry\n\nAlthough persons
    in risky positions (such as starship captains) use\nclones, the general Intaki
    public refrains from using them. Instead they\nhave a unique method for transferring
    the personality of a dying person\ninto a newborn baby. Steeped in tradition and
    perfected with technology,\nthe Reborn process is the ideal Intaki vision of 'afterlife'.\n\nHomeworld\n---------\n\nIntaki
    V, known to as \"Intaki Prime\" to its inhabitants, is a tropical planet and a
    place of great natural beauty.\nIn a speech, Vremaja Idama described it:\n\n\"Intaki
    Prime is a jewel among planets. It is tropical and filled with diverse lifeforms.
    We have lived and grown on this planet for time beyond measure. I was born in
    the town of Asaya, sitting at the base of the Akat mountain range. These mountains
    mark the southern end of the habitable region of the north pole. My town was hidden
    from the harsh sunlight in the deep valleys that intersect the mountain range.
    Intaki Prime is a very hot world, and both polar regions were once thick with
    tropical forests. The equatorial oceans are exceedingly hot, and few living things
    survive around the equator. The rich and varied life of Intaki Prime has been
    confined to the polar regions, and in constant struggle for land, food, and shelter
    from the environment.\"\n\nThe administrative capital of Intaki V is the city
    of Navyii Akat, a former mining town in the foothills of the Akat Mountains that
    expanded rapidly when the Intaki Assembly chose it as its meeting place due to
    its relatively central location. \n\nThe traditional and cultural capital of Intaki
    Prime is Lenoika, which remains the largest population center of the planet. The
    ancient city sprawls across a coastal river delta fed by a system of tributaries
    that ultimately rise from the Akat range far to the south-east. \n\nIn contrast
    to the beauty of the planet's surface, the Intaki solar\nsystem has a 0.1 security
    status rating from\n[CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt). Similarly low security
    status exists\nthroughout most of the Placid region, with the elevated crime rates
    that\ncome with it. This has been a source of political contention, especially\namong
    [capsuleers](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ).\n\nHistory and Politics\n--------------------\n\nThe
    first contact between the Gallente and the Intaki was made in 22794\nAD, 327 years
    before the founding of the Federation. At the time, the\nIntaki were technologically
    pre-industrial but socially and culturally\nadvanced. Within a century, they caught
    up with the Gallente, mastering\nspace travel to settle other nearby regions and
    holding positions in the\nGallente government.\n\nWhen the Intaki were negotiating
    for Federation membership, one of the\nstipulations of their joining was for a
    minimal\n[Federation Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1) presence in the system. \"The
    original\nIntaki representatives asked for minimal protection at the founding
    of\nthe Federation,\" according to Vremaja Idama. \"We have always valued our\nindependence
    and self-reliance.\" In the modern era, however, he says,\n\"We have been left
    to suffer\", referring to the lackluster response to\nthe Reschard V disaster
    and the rampant space piracy that didn't exist\nwhen the original deal was made.\n\nIntaki
    citizens in the Federation comprise the largest portion of the\n\"Doves\" voting
    block. Doves object to military action in all but the\nmost clearly defensive
    cases, though do not endorse total pacifism and\nsimilarly extremist views.\n\n###
    The Gallente-Caldari War\n\nDuring the breakout of the [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV),
    many Intaki sympathized\nwith the Caldari, both openly and not. This was a potentially
    dangerous\nposition to have with the ultra-nationalist politicians that had taken\nover
    the Federation government at the time.\n\nOf the active dissenters, those that
    were deemed the biggest threat to\nthe Federation were arrested and exiled, forbidden
    to colonize any\nplanets or moons. A group of these exiles built stations in lawless\nspace
    and formed The Intaki Syndicate in the region that now bears the\nsame name. Dorn
    en Diabel, governor of the station in Poitot, became the\nde facto leader and
    established the Syndicate as a free haven from the\nempires as well as a hub of
    black market trade. After his death in a\nfreak accident, governorship of the
    station bounced between his sons\nuntil his daughter, Silphy en Diabel, took over.
    Because of her ties\nwith V. Salvador Sarpati, the Syndicate is now known to have
    connections\nwith the [Serpentis](64u7D7YksvODwmCFL3llMs).\n\nA group of more
    militant exiles went to the Caldari and joined the\n[Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN).
    They were put under the command\nof the Caldari commander Muryia Mordu and earned
    a reputation as an\nelite fighting unit. After the war they were allowed to settle
    in Waschi\nCity on the planet of Kamokor IV. They remained there until xenophobic\nsentiment
    among the Caldari lead to violence and ultimately drove them\nout. They called
    on Mordu for assistance and went on to form the\nmercenary corporation [Mordu's
    Legion](5csCeDqUe1exvVyfPdL75Q). \n\nVremaja Idama, who had been Reborn many times
    dating back before contact\nbetween the Gallente and Intaki and gave history lectures
    at the\n[University of Caille](3yrFWFSjOxnFu1GTFhudTM), described the\nsituation
    of Intaki who remained with the Federation at the time:\n\n\"We were afraid of
    those \"in power\". (...) [Violence was] never threatened openly. But when our
    fellow Federation citizens were bombarded, it was not a huge leap of reasoning
    to believe that any others expressing rebellious attitudes would be similarly
    dealt with. Whether it was true or not, I don't know. But we were afraid, and
    so many remained quiet and sought other ways to continue. Some left. Others became
    politicians.\"\n\n### YC 105 - YC 109\n\n#### Reschard V\n\nOn February 8, YC
    108, a planet-wide explosion struck the planet of\nReschard V, destroying the
    agricultural, primarily Intaki colony and\nrendering the planet largely uninhabitable.
    The blast was eventually\ndetermined by [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) and
    Mordu's Legion\ninvestigators to have been caused by the deployment of a Judgement\ndoomsday
    device from an Avatar-class Titan, which escaped through a\ncynosaural field accompanied
    by the activation of several other cynos to\ncover its tracks. It took rescue
    convoys from the [Sisters of EVE](77ihwsVRHRojCaPC5XZn2g) over seven months to
    reach the planet\nsurface safely, further complicated by pirate attacks on the
    convoys.\nCONCORD has never released details on the perpetrator.\n\n#### Gallente
    Elections\n\nDurring the presidential election of YC 108, Intaki voters played
    a\nsignificant role in the re-election of [Souro Foiritan](37ecuyyUNrWqNAzxwC5Wbt).
    The controversial proposals of\n[Mentas Blaque](1bZzUGejHEhyHp6LVUtjBT) to segregate
    immigrant\npopulations into designated districts and his ultranationalist leanings\nbrought
    voters to the polls in droves.\n\n### The Empyrean Age - YC 110 to present\n\nIn
    the aftermath of the Caldari attack on Luminaire, most Intaki in the\nFederation
    were as appalled as the rest of their fellow citizens at the\nevents. Those that
    associate with the Doves were equally appalled at\ncalls for unrestrained retaliation
    and hope that Luminaire can be\nrecovered as peacefully as possible. A fringe
    element still sympathize\nwith the Caldari cause but so far has not expressed
    itself in unrest on\nthe scale of what occurred during the first war a century
    ago.\n\nBecause of the CONCORD Emergency Militia War Powers Act, most of Placid,\nincluding
    the Intaki system, is part of the active war zone in the\ncurrent war between
    the Gallente Federation and the Caldari State.\nPlacid shares a border with the
    Caldari State at [Black Rise](black-rise).\n\nHaving watched in horror the bloodshed
    of the two temporary war zones,\nthe station administrators of the Syndicate are
    having to ask themselves\nsome very difficult questions. While nominally a wholly
    independent and\nnon-aligned body, the Syndicate has nevertheless always retained
    strong\nties to the Federation. Currently, their residents are feeling immensely\nsympathetic
    to the plight of their Federal brothers\\-particularly fellow\nIntaki\\-even to
    the point of suggesting a more moderate stance toward\nthem. The more far-sighted
    officials, however, have a feeling that\nrelations will get a lot worse before
    they get better.\n\nIn the third month of YC 111, Federation forces in the Intaki
    system\nfell to the [State Protectorate](2VlyV0CDyxFv0Qg3N3dW8k), ceding\noccupancy
    to the Caldari state. Unrest and violence broke out in\nplaces on the Intaki homeworld,
    divided between pro-Federation,\npro-State and Intaki secessionist factions. Active
    protests mostly\nabated over the following weeks, but the general unrest persisted
    amid\nworry over the intentions of the Caldari (who did not take control on\nthe
    ground at the time) and shortages of high-tech and heavy industry\ngoods. Panic
    resumed mid-August upon the announcement that the \nCaldari Providence Directorate
    would be\nauctioning off development rights to the occupied systems, prompting
    the\nplanetary government to instate a curfew. Fear and speculation led\nto a
    tense standoff in one farming community between police and\narmed would-be resistance
    forces, although the standoff ended\npeacefully. The system was bid on and the
    auction won by [Ishukone Corporation](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI). Unknown to the
    general\npublic, Ishukone was involved in a deal with an anonymous Gallente or\nIntaki
    capsuleer to acquire the system as a form of protective\ncustody. As with all
    other Caldari-occupied systems, Intaki was\nbarred from voting in the Gallente
    presidential elections of November YC\n111 triggered by the resignation of Souro
    Foiritan, a fact which may\nhave hurt the chances of candidate Celes Aguard against
    the\neventual winner, [Jacus Roden](1ijjvREo0tNCQD1EKlUa5z).\n\nCulture\n-------\n\n###
    Ida - The Intaki Faith\n\nIn a speech given upon his return to Intaki from Bourynes,
    Vremaja Idama\nspoke of the Intaki Way:\n\n\"We are considered by outsiders to
    be a quiet, reserved and thoughtful people. The unwritten laws, or customs, of
    the Intaki give rise to these impressions. We tend to think before we speak, preferring
    to give a concise statement rather than half formed thoughts. When someone is
    involved in a task we prefer to let them acknowledge our presence rather than
    interrupting. We also tend to look at problems in a more holistic way, considering
    all things connected.\nMuch of this is crystallized in our philosophy, or as others
    call it \"the Intaki Faith\". We simply call it Ida\u2014the literal translation
    is \"to consider\", and is a good description of the Intaki. Some try to belittle
    us by calling it \"the path of least resistance\", although that is a good description!\n\nWe
    who follow the Way aim to live a life of moderation, not succumbing to the extremes
    of self-indulgence or self-denial. Ida is a way of living, we do not have any
    beliefs in a heaven or hell, and do not take any writing or saying as \"truth\".
    Ida is a path, but Intaki are expected to walk it themselves.\n\nOne core tenet
    is that all things are in a cycle. Death leads to rebirth. A solution only leads
    to more problems. We know that the \"soul\" or \"spirit\" is eternal and will
    be reborn many times to learn new lessons, and once it fully understands the cycle
    it may finally move on. The Reborn are an important part of this. These were people
    who had reached a level of understanding that they may choose to be liberated,
    but choose to remain and teach others. In earlier times there were many tests
    and rituals to ensure that a soul had indeed been reborn, and through mental discipline
    and training these Reborn were able to continue their life work over many lifetimes.
    These rare people were given the title of Idama.\n\nIn modern times, with the
    assistance of technology, the rebirth process has been made more certain. In fact
    many of the techniques and experiences of the Reborn have assisted the development
    and perfection of psyche restoration and cloning. But even today the status of
    Idama is still reserved for those who have been reborn without assistance.\"\n\nNotable
    Intaki\n--------------\n\nThe former President of the Gallente Federation, Souro
    Foiritan is of\nIntaki ancestry. It was a sudden surge in voting from Intaki and
    Mannar\ncitizens that secured his victory over Mentas Blaque, whose\nnationalistic
    campaign platform included a proposal to segregate\ncommunities of non-Gallente
    immigrants.\n\nA couple of Idama have made headlines among the capsuleer community
    in\npast years:\n\n-   Vremaja Idama is an outspoken advocate of Intaki culture
    and the\n    improvement of security for the Placid region.\n-   Sundari Idama
    was involved in a drug-trafficking scheme which\n    resulted in a major incident
    (commonly known as the RISE Incident),\n    in which a Serpentis carrier full
    of RISE was intercepted and\n    captured by a fleet of capsuleer pilots under
    the temporary command\n    of Vorada Kuvakei of the Illoren and then impounded
    by Inspector\n    Xavier of [Federation Customs](2LZwH7MsRSRhlMHNegrgGx).\n\nSilphy
    en Diabel is the de facto leader of the Intaki Syndicate after\ntaking over from
    her late father and seizing power from her less\ncompetent brothers.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n-
