- body: '**Dropships** are a class of starship that can land on planets and

    operate in atmospheric conditions. The largest dropships are military

    variants capable of delivering infantry and armored vehicles to surface

    combat zones.


    Use and limitations

    -------------------


    These ships can only warp for short distances, cannot mount standard

    starship weapons, and cannot use [stargates](416pCzXGIwn2Tt7feZYSpk). They

    are transported across interstellar distances by carrier-class or higher

    ships. Dropships can be armed with anti-dropship, anti-aircraft, and

    anti-armor ground suppression weapons platforms.


    They use [fusion](50ccQDKYOFOFmw0RqFCRmR)-generated thrust for

    takeoff and landing. [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk)

    interstellar vessels as they exist today cannot perform surface

    landings, and the largest dropship class is no bigger than a

    [cruiser](3wE5sDRggwgYjiExdCRyL0).
