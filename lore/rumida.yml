- body: '**Rumida** is a planet in the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo). An
    ocean on Rumida was impacted by an asteroid around YC 100. Thousands of homes
    were destroyed and people killed as a result of powerful shockwaves which plowed
    through the surface along a path several kilometers wide. Several thousand people
    were left deaf thanks to intense sound waves. This event is similar to one prophesied
    in a century-old book called "[The Seven Events of the Apocalypse](1vsutxaE6RLjfDo0cJuevU)."
