    [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) still absorbing the implications of\nEmpress
    [Jamyl I's](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L) emancipation of all slaves\nof 9th generation
    and upwards, New Year brought news of some holders in\noutlying regions of the
    [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) refusing to\ncomply with the Imperial decree
    on slave releases. While hundreds of\nmillions of slaves had been or were in the
    process of being released\nfollowing the [Empress's](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) proclamation,\nholders
    controlling several million slaves in systems in the\n[Aridia](uPYIH9Hhde0bYIaZFR4eB)
    and Genesis regions defied the edict and\ndemanded the [Theology Council](38uUjWk3RiR80FqDwjmQWk)
    make a\nruling on the religious legality of the order. Some recalcitrant\n[Holders](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v)
    also went so far as to appeal to the\n[Speakers of Truth](3vA8Xh4A10DiybH2UTOEUO),
    in itself suggesting\nthat this was for them a direct dispute with Empress Jamyl
    I.\n\nThe hopes of the so-called 'Refusard' Holders were to be dashed when the\nTheology
    Council swiftly condemned them and called on all Imperial\nsubjects to enforce
    the will of Empress Jamyl I. The Theology Council's\ntrenchant ruling reaffirmed
    the ancient doctrine that \"the word of the\nEmpress is the word of God, the will
    of the Empress is the will of God\"\nand warned of harsh punishment for those
    continuing to refuse the edict.\nEmpire-wide transmission of the Council's ruling,
    and news that the\nSpeakers of Truth declined to intervene, led to a widespread
    collapse of\nthe Refusards with many immediately complying and repenting before\nofficials
    of the [Imperial Chancellor](7GOV3morIu47J3BmidrhU8).\n\nHowever, several holders
    on several planets in the Aridia region, known\nfor its plethora of hardline cults
    and ultra-orthodox sects, maintained\ntheir refusal to release slaves under the
    terms of the edict, citing\nreligious justification. Chancellor\n[Kor-Azor](2puF18pxR6b7AVuy3HE9IV)
    instructed a fleet seconded to\nthe Chancellery to enforce the edict using all
    means necessary. It is\nknown that the enforcement fleet subjected several Refusard
    holder\nestates and associated targets to heavy bombardment from orbit, and\nnumerous
    locations were assaulted by Chancellery troops. In all, these\nactions resulted
    in the seizure of over 15 million slaves who were\nsubsequently released in line
    with the emancipation proclamation.\n\nThe treatment of the most recalcitrant
    Refusards was harsh indeed, with\nthe leaders summarily executed and their followers
    and families reduced\nto [slavery](slavery) for generations. Others who less\ndramatically
    sought to evade the edict's terms were also firmly dealt\nwith as holders using
    subterfuge and fraud to keep their 9th generation\nslaves were pursued by the
    [Ministry of Internal Order](5P4c9Lcr1rAUNd2Lb8gb3t). In a notable case, the\nwealthy
    slaveholder Adash Korta, Holder of Dakba and owner of something\nover half a million
    slaves, was found to have altered the genealogical\nrecords of his stock, thereby
    hiding the 9th generation and above status\nof approximately 100,000 slaves. The
    Theology Council made an example of\nKorta, condemning him to slavery, stripping
    his family of noble rank and\ndistributing his assets between the new Holder of
    Dakba and other local\nHolders.\n\nReactions to the emancipation edict across
    New Eden were somewhat mixed.\nThe [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) was
    muted in its reactions but\nclearly many saw it as an opportunity to ease old
    tensions between the\nCaldari, legally and culturally opposed to slavery, and
    the Amarr over\nthe issue. In the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK)
    many\nwelcomed the release of hundreds of millions of slaves, although\nconcerns
    were expressed by some politicians that it could result in a\nnew influx of refugees
    to Gallente regions. The\n[Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) diaspora in the Federation
    was more\nsceptical as to the quality of Empress Jamyl I's mercy. This view found\nmore
    than an echo in the response from the Minmatar Republic, where\n[Sanmatar](180IYq6xQy0PzfGH6hLEuO)
    [Maleatu Shakor](3H5EVyO9kiyIUOEELIqOlV) warned of 'Amarr treachery' even as\nhe
    welcomed millions of slaves home to the Minmatar worlds.\n\nReaction to Executions\n----------------------\n\nReactions
    to the\nwidely-publicized executions of the Gallente Admiral [Anvent Eturrer](4ft267N4XjELE5by1uHCt5)
    and former Amarr [Court Chamberlain](4cstqCKrXLAu5XDiqztSe6) [Dochuta\nKarsoth](1qDadkKQ3HzwYZpl2r4JLL)
    at the end of the last year\ncontinued for some time. Most strident in their criticism
    of the very\npublic and grotesque method of cellular immolation used by the\nFederation
    to put to death the traitor Eturrer were the Servant [Sisters of EVE](2eTQAT2DL0C7TWVtkOr8pN),
    calling it \"barbaric and inhumane\"\nand urging the method be banned. The Federation
    government made no\nofficial response to this but many Gallente citizens defended
    the public\nexecution and even the immolation method. Pro-war rallies saw many\nthousands
    backing the Federation's approach, though other citizens\nexpressed quiet reservations.
    In contrast, reaction to the private,\nalmost dignified execution of Dochuta Karsoth
    were few. However, an\n[Amarr Imperial Navy](3PKvXZS0iHKIgAmO9np74g) observer's
    report of the\n[Royal Khanid Navy](nQJFwBFQzGij9cZKKCrm7) operations against the\n[Blood
    Raider](7obiU8rOyJkPZ3S0Faxc5W) Covenant that netted Karsoth\ntold of the heavy
    cost on both sides.\n\nEconomic Stimulus\n-----------------\n\nEarly in January,
    in another bold initiative from the Amarr Empire,\nEmpress Jamyl I announced a
    multi-trillion ISK package of investment\ninto the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy).
    The Caldari-Amarr Economic\nStimulus Agreement (CAESA) was negotiated with the
    assistance of the\n[Tash-Murkon Family](4t1KEOTA8LvYIHDcOtIPAb) and the Khanid\nKingdom
    but reactions within the Empire were\nmixed. While the more liberal Tash-Murkon
    and Kor-Azor hailed the\ninvestment package, religious conservatives and Amarr
    business leaders\nexpressed concern that such investment should more properly
    be aimed at\nAmarr businesses. In the Caldari State reactions were almost entirely\nfavorable,
    with Executor [Tibus Heth](6E1MZyo3l7DscBmmOdp7KG) welcoming\nthe package and
    pledging that the Amarr Empire would receive a\nprofitable return on the investment.
    In a development related to the\nemancipation, the Caldari Providence\nDirectorate
    announced it\nwould be making available a number of experienced trainers for\nsecondment
    within the Amarr Empire to train former slaves who choose to\ntake up residence
    there.\n\nMilitia Warfare Increases\n-------------------------\n\nOther developments
    across New Eden as the year began included increased\nlevels of fighting between
    the militias in the war zone even as the [Caldari Navy's](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN)
    logistics command published a report\ndetailing the costs of occupying [Caldari
    Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i). The scale of the costs both in ISK,\nmateriel
    and morale among occupying troops came as a surprise to some\nand the liberal
    faction megacorporation\n[Hyasyoda](WisddAsk7hie3SUcwiNwa) used the occasion of
    a\ndebate on the report in the [Chief Executive Panel](5OC2T1uqCSy4NUPhhpq9Xr)
    to criticize the military\npolicies of State Executor Tibus Heth. While this criticism
    elicited\nsome support, the patriot bloc corporations, in particular [Lai Dai](5k5GiWRlFceyTjLSz71XT),
    supported Heth's policies\nvigorously. Perhaps more ominous for Heth than the
    almost expected\ncriticism from the liberals was the silence of the practical
    faction\ncorporations. Certainly, the grim tally set out in the report had\nclearly
    caused disquiet among the profit-conscious Caldari megacorps.\n\nCompetition for
    Ishukone Succession\n-----------------------------------\n\n Another\nsignificant
    development in the Caldari State concerned the [Ishukone Corporation](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI),
    without a CEO since the\nMalkalen Disaster in May [YC110](4s7KrRaqQANTatQhzlSaRi),
    and the\nmegacorporation's long search for a new chief executive. With several\ncandidates
    having fallen by the wayside the previous year, it emerged\nthat the Ishukone
    board was seriously considering two leading\ncontenders: Mens Reppola, CEO of
    [Ishukone Watch](21GQBhNgawJQQ39wqVX4yU) and a friend of the late [Otro Gariushi](5QydCJCoYvbvbWvFlAlbHg),
    and Soisonen Okalala, CEO of\nIshukone mining subsidiary [Minedrill](2cjgnHBuWiKY7pH2xjzvG0).
    With both\ncandidates being chief executives within the Ishukone family of\ncorporations
    and appealing to different tendencies within the Ishukone\nboard, the competition
    between the two was expected to be close.\n\nTraditions and 6th Tournament\n-----------------------------\n\nIn
    the Minmatar Republic, an upsurge of interest in the history of the\nMinmatar
    and its tribes was most interestingly manifested in a great\nincrease in enthusiasm
    for the traditional cuisine of the Minmatar\npeoples. The Minmatar [Native Freshfood](kxxhlMqv4IIzQkSf083E2)\ncorporation
    reported a rise in sales of traditional ingredients and\nrecipe books, attributing
    it to the cost-effectiveness of traditional\ncuisine as well as the attraction
    of eating \"like Minmatar.\"\n\nThe Independent Gaming Commission announced its
    6th Alliance Tournament\nfor [capsuleers](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) would begin
    at the end of the\nmonth. In a move that was perhaps designed to play on patriotic
    feelings\nin the core empires, and thereby increase viewing figures, the IGC\nannounced
    that teams from the four militias would be accepted into the\nqualifying rounds
    of the tournament. In the event, none of the militia\nteams progressed past the
    qualifiers into the final rounds, perhaps\nunable to score sufficiently against
    seasoned and well-equipped\ncapsuleer alliance squads despite some individual
    wins.\n"
