    involved in the [Omicron Incident](6DrNULs5fhn08ajtKLHiqc). He was tricked into

    systems. Reluctant to go to war with an poorly-equipped army, he was relieved
    to discover a [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) arms merchant ([the Broker](35XiT6V98vAeV9AdpZyl72)
    in disguise) visiting his capital. As open war broke out between the two Holders,
    the [Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) was forced to send a royal arbitrator to
    calm things down. By that time, both Holders had already spent their fortunes
    on weapons.
