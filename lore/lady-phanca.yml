    IV](6Dhz7HjegSpFQc36TepEJ9), who reigned roughly 700 years ago.\nShe was noted
    for having an unusual amount of influence over her son,\ndirecting many of his
    policies from behind the scenes. Her most enduring\nlegacy is the [Ardishapur
    Decree](6hU25lQLApAKe2PoFmqQpB).\n\nLife\n----\n\nBorn Phanca Matricus, the third
    daughter of a high-ranking [noble family](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v), Lady Phanca
    was not presented with much\nopportunity by her family. The young woman was far
    more ambitious than\nher birth order allowed her. She frequently chafed against
    the\nrestrictions her family placed on her, including attempts to push her\ninto
    joining the church, and looked for ways to advance her own station.\n\nHer opportunity
    arose when her family decided to enter into a political\nmarriage with the [Kador
    Family](3ium7VluTCFnGS0TqpinlO). Originally,\nit was her elder brother who would
    marry a daughter of the Kador Family,\nbut the brother balked at the proposed
    wife. Phanca stepped in, agreeing\nto marry a Kador son in exchange. Her proposal
    was accepted and she\nmarried into the [Heir Family](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh).\n\nLady
    Phanca's husband was reportedly untalented and unmotivated, and\ndespite her efforts
    he remained unimportant in history. He did give her\na son, however, whom she
    named Velenus after a former Kador Emperor. She\nimmediately began to assert her
    dominance over Velenus.\n\nAccording to all reports, Lady Phanca pushed her son
    to rise to great\nheights. Though the boy inherited his mother's talents, he also
    was\ncursed with his father's lack of ambition. It was only his mother's\ndominance
    that caused him to rise through the Family ranks. She worked\nin the shadows to
    advance his cause, while exerting her authority over\nhim.\n\nWhen [Damius III](4YXvIhUK7GjrXhK4dZ5AOM)
    died, she used her charismatic\nruthlessness to help her son's cause. He wound
    up being elected Emperor\nand was crowned [Velenus IV](6Dhz7HjegSpFQc36TepEJ9).\n\nArdishapur
    Decree\n---------------------\n\nAs the mother of the Emperor, Phanca began to
    use her influence over her\nson to affect Imperial policy. Velenus IV mostly acceded
    to his mother's\ndemands. As she aged, she became far more strict and shrewish,
    leading\nto some rather capricious edicts.\n\nThe most notable, and lasting edict,
    is the Ardishapur Decree. Lady\nPhanca had a pet [furrier](55Py0v5XOZySNC1oWsEV2O)
    that had been her\ncompanion for several years. She doted over it, lavishing it
    with gifts\nand attention. She allowed the creature to run free, which often caused\ndistress
    to those around her, who said nothing in fear of risking the\nwoman's wrath.\n\nDuring
    a visit to the [Ardishapur](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO) royal\npalace, Lady Phanca
    allowed the furrier to run amok across the dinner\ntable. The animal began to
    harass [Uri Ardishapur](544JRCbSvLEGko9J3ARQwm), the son of the Ardishapur Heir.\nThe
    young man was impetuous and hot-headed and he struck the creature,\nknocking it
    from the table and breaking its neck.\n\nLady Phanca was furious. She persuaded
    her son to pass an edict that the\nyoung man, and all his descendants, would have
    the offending hand\namputated. The Ardishapur Family, always conservative and
    loyal,\naccepted without complaint and Uri Ardishapur lost his right hand.\nHowever,
    the Family replaced it with a silver cybernetic\n[prosthetic](5qIWvxsa4ayo3MzGijHspk),
    as no such rule against it had\nbeen created. Since then, the Family has taken
    the silver prosthetic as\na badge of honor.\n\nLater Life\n----------\n\nLady
    Phanca outlived her son by several decades. The next Emperor found\nher meddling
    bothersome, so he exiled her back to the Kador Family\npalaces, essentially cutting
    her off from the [Emperor Family](IXrotYvoWOVnuGAMbbYEv). She continued to exert
    what limited\ninfluence she had over her servants.\n\nIn her later years, she
    began to suffer from dementia. Her demands\nbecame increasingly erratic and troublesome
    and her family mostly\nhumored the old woman as much as they could without revealing
    her\ntroubles to the public. She reportedly died peacefully in her sleep.\n\nSee
