- body: '**Skids**, real name Skidochi, is a [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy)

    mercenary. She was a firearms expert with a Quickdraw implant that

    allowed her to quickly draw and fire her weapon. Skids is noted to be

    rebellious, which led to her exile from the Caldari State. She continues

    to carry guilt over her inability to properly serve the State.


    Her mercenary team was hired to discover the location of [Anvent Eturrer](4ft267N4XjELE5by1uHCt5).
    Skids was noticeably agitated with

    the mission, growing more uncomfortable as it progressed, since the

    State considered Eturrer a hero. Her teammates, specifically

    [Jeanelle](31qt5S4KiXZpu5ggLHHsNd), noticed her increasing discomfort. Once

    Jeanelle managed to discover Eturrer''s location, Skids attempted to kill

    her to halt the transmission. However, [Asadir](1LI0JW7HmHC7Dey3QEhTuG) had

    rigged an EMP device that deactivated Skids''s Quickdraw implant, then

    Jeanelle activated a [Dead man''s switch](3Z5w49e94cXP0OFn0iBBQk)

    implant that knocked Skids unconscious. Skids'' memory was then wiped to

    before the mission, allowing her to forget her guilt over turning in

    Eturrer.
