    the Sebiestor are known far and wide as engineers and inventors. Their reputation
    for tinkering with any kind of technology is well deserved, and the Sebiestor
    become very passionate when their inquisitive nature is aroused. Occasionally,
    the Sebiestor passions can turn to obsession, and individuals can have a marked
    tendency to psychological cruelty and outbursts of temper. All that said, the
    Sebiestor, in the main, are very level headed, even when some project activates
    their energetic enthusiasm.\n\nExcellence in engineering naturally propelled the
    Sebiestor to the fore during the period when the Minmatar Empire pushed into space.
    During the Amarr occupation, the Sebiestor did much to hold what remained of Minmatar
    society together with their skill at maintaining or adapting technology. The Amarr
    themselves recognized the usefulness of the Sebiestor for use as slaves in roles
    requiring technical ability and had some interest in ensuring they had a pool
    of talent from which to draw such slaves. As a result, while the Sebiestor suffered
    much from the depredations of the slavers, the tribe avoided a total dissolution
    of their culture and communities.\n\nDuring the Great Rebellion, the Sebiestor
    became the armorers and quartermasters of the rebel forces, as well as providing
    many fighters, along with every tribe that rose up against the Amarr. When the
    Minmatar Republic was founded, the Sebiestor once more took a lead in space, and
    they are responsible for engineering most of the ships and stations constructed
    by the Minmatar. Once again free to work with advanced technology, the Sebiestor
    have established a reputation for a very high order of skill in mathematics and
    nanotechnology.\n\nPolitically the Sebiestor instinctively favor diplomacy before
    aggressive action, but the identification of the Karin Midular regime with \u201Cappeasement\u201D
    has significantly tempered this tendency, pushing the tribe toward a more hawkish
    stance as they seek to shake off that reputation. The assassination of Karin Midular,
    in a twist of black irony, has acted as further pressure in this direction. Regardless,
    the Sebiestor are a strong stabilizing influence within the republic and have
    always been the readiest to cooperate with others, even beyond the Minmatar tribes."
