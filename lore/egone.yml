    to clients.\n\n###Overview\n[Egonics Inc.](41x1mlLjrAPNSQCibjqWLQ) maintains a
    huge database containing personal profiles of billions of people. It is arguably
    the largest database of personal information owned by a non-governmental company.
    From that database, news, music and entertainment\u2014much of the latter specifically
    created by the Egonics itself\u2014are delivered to customers via specially-designed
    headsets called the Egone.\n\n\n###Technology\nEgonics use a unique method in
    distributing music to its customers. The Egone may look like a head ornament instead
    of a headphone. This is because it doesn\u2019t broadcast sound to the ears as
    normal headphones do, but rather projects the music directly to the zones in the
    brain that govern hearing, bypassing the ear altogether.\n\nThis has many obvious
    advantages, both for Egonics and the customer. Most importantly, there is no danger
    of illegal copying and distribution, as there is no actual sound to record. Also,
    there is no noise pollution and people can easily converse with each other as
    the ears are clear.\n\n\n###Entertainment\nEgonics employs thousands of sound
    engineers and musicians which constantly create music according to the specs of
    a certain group of customers.\n\nBecause Egonics recognizes hundreds of distinct
    taste patterns in the populace and makes certain everybody can find music that
    caters to their very special preferences, the corporation publishes thousands
    of songs every single day.\n\nAlthough the musicians employed by Egonics are total
    non-entities while in its service, they gain invaluable experience during their
    stay and a number of them have gone onto fame after their stint there.\n\n\n###Social
    Aspect\nEarly on, conservatives within the [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK)
    government vehemently opposed the data gathering methods used by Egonics. The
    corporation ingeniously used this opposition to its advantage by rallying young
    people to its cause, advocating personal freedom of all things. This was one of
    the major factors in the subsequent growth of the company; the Egone became a
    symbol of liberty among young people everywhere. The [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
    has forbidden the operation of Egonics Inc. within its borders. \n\nThe information
    in the Egonics database is extremely detailed: it lists both the social status
    of a person including job, education, marital status, and so on, but also very
    thorough genealogical and biological data, including DNA samples. Egonics uses
    every method possible to enlarge their database and keep it up to date. Some of
    these methods are frowned upon by many, but others applaud how dedicated the company
    is in making sure the customer gets exactly what he likes and there are some that
    thrive on selling Egonics DNA samples from people not in their vast database.\n\n\n###See
