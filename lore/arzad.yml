    Arzad II

    --------


    Arzad II was once a hot temperate world, but it underwent disastrous

    climate changes as the result of orbital bombardment. Once known as

    Starkman Prime, it was the capital world of the Starkmanir tribe. As a

    result of intervention by royal [Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) [Idonis Ardishapur](2ZNvkPaPzpj4IaVpL2vWK3),
    the planet was declared an

    Imperial Protectorate (see Khadrea''s Law), although the world is not

    subject to Imperial Law.


    Hidden Hope

    -----------


    Hidden Hope (or Vo''shun) is a population center situated within a deep

    ravine carved into the planet''s surface by orbital weapons systems. This

    is one of the few remaining inhabited places on Arzad II and is perhaps

    one of the most lawless settlements in the universe.
