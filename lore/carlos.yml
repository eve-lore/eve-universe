- body: '**"Carlos"** is a [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) man with a drawn-out
    accent. His knees crack and he smells of sweat. He is short and stocky with muscles
    that had started turning to fat. His hair, beard and clothes are all of trim cut,
    but dirty and grimy. His eyes look tired.


    He was nick-named Carlos by [Sebastian](5XvDRS1t6l5P9mK4ycTU6S) because he seemed
    the most human of the three interrogators.
