- body: "The **Chief Executive Panel** is a political entity jointly owned and run
    by the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) megacorporations. The CEOs of the mega
    corporations sit on the board of the Panel and make sure the mega corporations
    don't go overboard in competing with each other, smoothing over potential conflicts
    before they escalate out of control. The Panel also handles the foreign policy
    of the Caldari State. It is the closest thing to a Caldari government as there
    ever will be. \n\nThe Chief Executive Panel is the main bureaucratic apparatus
    through which the Caldari megacorporations rule the State. The Panel's primary
    purposes are to determine the budgets for the State's few government agencies,
    such as the [Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN) and the [Caldari Business Tribunal](32Y4no5DBn6kGO5HnWuYgH),
    and to act as a way for the State's corporate powers to coordinate national policy,
    such as foreign relations, customs and trade regulations, and inter-corporate
    business laws.\n\nThe Panel itself consists of the major megacorporate CEOs and
    a non-partisan director. In reality, the CEOs usually send a delegation of trusted
    executives, corporate lawyers, or board members to represent the corporation's
    interests on the Panel, and the director is nothing more than a figurehead, a
    pawn of the most influential political bloc at the time."
