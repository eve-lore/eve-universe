    and one of the many cultural and\neconomic centers of the wider [Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK).\nSituated
    on the river Stomeve in the heart of the Garoun continent, the\ncity dates back
    to before the rise of the Rouvenor dynasty, since\nexpanding to encompass nearby
    towns and villages into its wider\nconglomeration. It is perhaps most famously
    known as the home of the\n[University of Caille](3yrFWFSjOxnFu1GTFhudTM), and
    the\n[Crystal Boulevard](45ZcfxzqF7v2mqmLksGxYU), a shopping district\nthat is
    built over a hardened military bunker. As a hub of Luminaire\nculture alongside
    cities such as [Hueromont](1PzpjLA0ZHtQRZu2f8x4gO), it\nis famous across [New
    Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) for its\nextravagancy and flamboyancy.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n###
    Age of the Ancients\n\nCaille is one of the earliest recorded settlements on Gallente
    Prime,\nstarting out as nothing but a fishing settlement on the Stomeve river.\nFor
    many centuries, Caille (historically Cylle) did not develop beyond a\nfew hundred
    people, content to live in oblivion from the wider world.\nHowever, during the
    Iron Age, it became a strategic target for the\nvarious kingdoms that sought control
    of the Stomeve river, which ran\nfrom coast-to-coast along the continent. Caille
    eventually grew into a\nlarge town under the rule of various vassal leaders, exchanging
    hands\nbetween various empires on a frequent basis. Its stone walls did not\nalways
    prove adequate in fending off invaders, and Caille was often\npillaged and ransacked.\n\nEventually,
    the people of Caille had enough. In AD 21656, under the\nleadership of a young
    Doule dos Rouvenor, a new independent kingdom was\ndeclared. As an immediate threat
    to the other nations, a war raged on\nmultiple fronts. Thanks to King Rouvenor's
    tactical genius, he was able\nto fight back the invaders and expand the borders
    of his new kingdom,\nswaying the local populace to their cause with his charisma.
    Not two\nyears later, Rouvenor declared the creation of the first Garoun Empire,\nthe
    territory of which encompassed the entire continent.\n\n### Garoun Empire and
    Industrial Age\n\nAs the centrally-located capital of the new empire, Caille received
    an\ninflux of peoples and cultural ideas from across the continent. Although\nthe
    Garoun Empire was a continental power on a maritime world, its\nstatus as the
    greatest empire on Gallente Prime meant that it became the\ncenter of civilization
    at the time. Under the socially and\ntechnologically progressive rule of Doule
    dos Rouvenor III, Caille was a\nhub of philosophical and ethical thought, with
    slavery gradually\nbecoming eradicated during this era. The war with the seven
    armies of\nMorthane had little consequence on Caille, allowing it to flourish.\n\nWhen
    the Garoun Empire collapsed under its own weight in AD 21837,\nCaille became the
    first industrialized city on Gallente Prime. Its city\nlimits began expanding
    outwards, incorporating other towns and\nsettlements into its greater metropolitan
    area. While pollution became a\nproblem, the development of ecological technologies
    during\npost-industrialization mitigated many of the long-term consequences of\nthis.
    Caille's location meant it was undisturbed by the information era\nwars, and would
    be one of the leading cities in the eventual\nglobalization of Gallente Prime,
    even as a much smaller nation-state\nthan it once was.\n\n### Federation era\n\nWhen
    the [Gallente Federation was founded in AD 23121](5hUiG2COBH343iSJznERSi),\nCaille
    was selected to be the capital of the new colonial alliance. This\nwas unsurprising
    to many critics of the Federation's founding, noting\nthe dominance of the Gallente
    in interstellar affairs at the time.\nGovernmental buildings were constructed,
    including a presidential palace\nthat is sometimes still used to this day, and
    Caille soon experienced\nall the benefits of being the center of an interstellar
    empire.\n\nUnder the\nUltra-Nationalist during the beginning of the [Gallente-Caldari
    War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV),\nCaille was ruled with an iron fist. The U-Nat secret
    police had a strong\npresence in the city, and it is generally regarded as a very
    dark period\nin Caille's history. During this time, the Ultra-Nationalists drew
    up\nplans to construct an heavily fortified bunker for the Federal\ngovernment
    beneath the city, to protect the military and political\ncommand in the event
    of something that Caldari admiral [Yakiya Tovil-Toba](RsUoECrk1bkV0t35D4sDE) ended
    up doing, crashing his\ncarrier into the city of Hueromont and killing two million
    people.\n\nThough the bunker was never constructed under the Ultra-Nationalists,\nthe
    Federation government that followed after the Hueromont Incident\ndecided to go
    through with the plans. Instead of constructing the bunker\nbeneath the city itself,
    it was built under the green belt next to\nCaille's financial district. The space
    above the bunker was then rented\nto businesses and corporations, constructing
    the modern day Crystal\nBoulevard. The Boulevard acts as a shield for the bunker,
    twenty meters\ndeep of pure synthetic diamond, followed by eighty meters worth
    of\nlatticed, crystal-carbonate nanofiber armor.\n\nWhen the Federation capital
    was moved from Luminaire to Villore, the\nbunker was handed over by the Federal
    government to the Gallente Prime\nmilitary, and it is now the heart of the world's
    planetary defense\nnetwork, rumored to have expanded tenfold since its original\nconstruction,
    and subject to many conspiracy theories. Despite Caille no\nlonger being the capital
    city of the Federation, it continues to enjoy\nits status as one of the cultural
    and economic hearts of the wider\nnation.\n\nGeography & Environment\n-----------------------\n\nCaille
    is located roughly in the center of the Garoun continent, built\non both sides
    of the Stomeve river. The surrounding terrain is mostly\ngrasslands and rolling
    hills, making the city relatively flat, though it\nis not far from the marsh and
    alpine regions of Garoun. Caille\nexperiences a continental climate, with four
    distinct seasons. The\nsummer months are hot and humid, while the winters are
    cold, snowy and\nwindy. Rising sea levels, though quite minimal on Gallente Prime\noverall,
    did not have much effect on the Stomeve river. This\nunremarkable and inoffensive
    climate allowed Caille to continue to hold\nonto its status for hundreds of years,
    not being victim to any natural\ndisasters that may have stifled its development.\n\nThe
    farmlands outside of Caille's city limits are home to many different\nvillages
    and small towns, while there are some forests that inhabit the\ncity's green belt,
    home to a variety of different domestic animal\nspecies. The natural environment
    did not suffer much permanent damage\nduring Caille's industrialization, as the
    local expertise for ecological\npreservation went a long way to maintaining an
    equilibrium with the\nsurroundings.\n\nCityscape & Infrastructure\n--------------------------\n\nCaille
    is a low-rise city that is located around and along the Stomeve\nriver. Encompassing
    many different historical towns and districts, there\nis no universal architectural
    style to the city, and it would take many\nvisits to explore Caille in its entirety.
    The oldest parts of the city\nare located centrally, with the districts gradually
    becoming more recent\nthe further out one goes, with contemporary suburbs located
    past the\ngreen belt that encircles the inner and medial parts of the city,\nalthough
    incorporated towns and villages in these areas retain their\nhistorical architecture.
    The original campus of the University of\nCaille, founded towards the end of the
    Rouvenor era, is located on the\noutskirts of the city, nestled in a forested
    area, with some\nsub-campuses located within Caille itself.\n\nCentral Caille
    is marked by the white stone walls that date back\nthousands of years. Though
    these walls have decayed to almost nothing in\nsome places, they are nonetheless
    preserved by the city authorities as a\nboundary to the center of town. Located
    within these boundaries is the\nCity of the Ancients, an historical site that
    encompasses the oldest\nbuildings and pathways of the city, built using white
    marble. The\narchitecture is somewhat eccentric compared to the rest of Caille,\ncomprised
    of sharp triangular and circular constructions, along with\nwhite brick roadways.
    In the heart of the City of the Ancients is the\nSanctuary of the Seventh\nGoddess,
    the city's largest and main cathedral, famous for its multicolored crystal windows\nand
    gemstone mosaics. Its spire is the highest point in Caille outside\nthe Crystal
    Boulevard and financial district, and can be seen from most\nplaces in the city.
    The equally ancient Palace of the Ens\xEEks (Kings) straddles\nthe edge of the
    City of the Ancients and the rest of central Caille,\naccessible from either side.
    It is the extravagant residence of the\ncurrent royal family, dating back to Doule
    dos Rouvenor II.\n\nThe rest of central Caille is, for the most part, composed
    of industrial\nera terraced blocks ranging from four to ten storeys high, with
    distinct\nmansard roofing. The shades and colorations of these buildings vary\ngreatly.
    There are also some sidestreets with half-timber buildings,\nwhich often host
    various public houses. The roads are mostly\ncobblestone, although busier thoroughfares
    have been replaced with\nasphalt and/or concrete. The Houses of the High Parliament
    is also\nlocated in this part of the city. The financial district, known as\nL'Neiro,
    is located by the river, made up of early modern skyscrapers of\nglass, steel
    and concrete, being one of the few high-rise areas in the\ncity. The Crystal Boulevard,
    perhaps the most well-known district in\nCaille, sits in between L'Neiro and the
    green belt. Everything in the\nBoulevard, from the roads to the lamp posts, is
    made from materials that\nseek to emulate a crystalline appearance, including
    glass or\nsynthetically grown diamond. The Boulevard has a set of its own\ncrystalline
    skyscrapers of typical Gallente design, though no buildings\nexceed the height
    of the Sanctuary's main spire. The power requirements\nfor both L'Neiro and the
    Boulevard are provided by their own solar\nreceivers, while the rest of the city's
    power is provided for by a\nhydroelectric dam upriver, in the alpine mountain
    regions nearby.\n\nThe city has an extensive public transport system, with a bus
    network\nand an underground metro that covers most of the metropolitan area.\nRailways,
    constructed during industrialization, remain particularly\nimportant, snaking
    outwards across the Garoun continent and connecting\nup with other towns and cities.
    Doule dos Rouvenor Spaceport provides\nlinks to other areas of Gallente Prime,
    and offers flights to mooring\nstations in orbit.\n\nPolitics\n--------\n\nCaille
    is the capital of the (Ens\xEEnate) Kingdom of Central Garoun, a legacy nation\nand
    sub-planetary member of the Gallente Federation. It is also the host\nof Gallente
    Prime's planetary assembly. As the brief capital of the\nFederation, Central Garoun
    lost authority over the city, forced to move\nits administrative capital elsewhere.
    It was returned to the nation when\nVillore became the new Federal capital, however.
    Central Garoun is a\nconstitutional monarchy, though actual power is exclusively
    held by the\nHigh Parliament, with the royal family mostly around for the purposes
    of\nceremony, tradition and culture.\n\nWhen the Garoun Empire collapsed centuries
    ago, there was a brief civil\nwar between a democratist and royalist faction.
    The former wished to\noverthrow the monarchy and replace it with a democratic
    system under\nuniversal suffrage, while the royalists sought to retain their\ntraditional
    system, citing the need for a strong leader in the face of a\nrapidly realigning
    continent. A compromise was reached, establishing a\ndemocratic legislature alongside
    a weaker monarchy. Over the next few\ngenerations, the High Parliament grew in
    power, reducing the monarchy to\nhaving nothing but a ceremonial role.\n\nUnlike
    Hueromont, Caille did not apply for independent megalopolis\nstatus on the Federal
    level, which would have granted it increased\nfreedoms and recognition nationally.
    Instead, how it is accounted for in\nthe administrative system appears overly
    complex and unnecessarily\nconvoluted to outsiders. It juggles the status of being
    the capital of\nits own pre-Federation legacy state, the *de facto* political
    center of\nGallente Prime, and a cultural hub of the wider Federation (which\nunofficially
    grants it more power and influence than it otherwise would\nhave). To the locals,
    Caille continuing to be apart of its legacy\nnation-state is important in respecting
    the history of the city, the\nlegacy of the Rouvenor dynasty, and its participating
    role in the\ndevelopment of modern Gallente culture.\n\nEconomy\n-------\n\nCaille
    is one of the two global cities of Gallente Prime, alongside\nHueromont. It is
    an economic powerhouse, primarily around the finance,\nservice and tourist industries,
    and is one of the most visited cities in\nNew Eden. Restaurants, nightclubs, theaters,
    opera houses and other such\nvenues rack in millions of ISK per year, while most
    New Eden\nmegacorporations have a presence in the city. The tourist and service\nsectors
    are centered around the City of the Ancients and the Crystal\nBoulevard, while
    L'Neiro is the heart of the financial sector.\nPreviously, the City of the Ancients
    took in the most tourist revenue\nlong before the Crystal Boulevard was conceived
    of. The former was not\nvery commercialized, and was highly regulated by the city
    authority,\nwith local businesses adopting a period aesthetic to fit in with the\nsurroundings.
    The Boulevard, however, remains mostly unregulated, with\nnew owners moving in
    and out in an endlessly cyclical fashion. Most of\nthese businesses, with the
    exception of venues such as nightclubs, are\nsubsidiaries of interstellar megacorporations.
    The L'Neiro district is\nshared between these megacorporations and older companies
    that date back\nbefore the Federation. The [Bank of Luminaire](4bnT8zUwvoUORCQotMfK7R),
    for example, has its original\nheadquarters at L'Neiro. As a result, the district
    has a strong sway in\nfinancial affairs, both on Gallente Prime and beyond.\n\nThough
    not as primary a leader in fashion as the Coriault Couture\nCollective or [Mannar](4BaMCkOwYaPpd4ZMtEfEY)
    Textile Institute\nInternational, Caille has its own ranges and designs, varying
    from\ncasual to eccentric. Widely-used Caillean leather (and its synthetic\nvariants)
    is produced and sold all over the cluster, with cheap\nimitations being found
    as far as [Dam-Torsad](UI6KVmdCZ0H42EvHijFVZ) on\n[Amarr Prime](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4).
    Entertainment, along with\nliterature and poetry, is another strong sector of
    Caille, with period\nholodramas set in old areas of the city being quite common.
    Fine\njewelery using gemstones is also a major export of Caille.\n\nDemographics
    & Culture\n----------------------\n\nCaille is extremely cosmopolitan, incorporating
    peoples and cultures\nfrom all four corners of New Eden. This melting pot manifests
    itself in\nmany different ways. For example, fashion follows the contemporary
    style\nwhile fusing in elements of other cultures, and the cuisine is\nconstantly
    evolving, as ingredients are imported from across the\ncluster. Demographically
    speaking, the population of Caille is extremely\ninterracial. The local Gallente
    are mixed between the different\nethnicities of the homeworld, who have in turn
    mixed with immigrants\nfrom off-world, including both Federation and non-Federation
    races.\nCaille has its own language dialect as a result of this.\n\nThe presence
    of the University of Caille had and still has a great\ninfluence on academic thought
    that is exported out of the city, going a\nlong way to shape classical and modern
    Gallente thought. Student\nactivism has an incredibly strong sway on grassroots
    politics, which is\namplified by the University's interstellar presence across
    the\nFederation. Moreover, the melting pot nature of the University, which is\nattended
    by students from all empires, has influenced Caille in being\nextremely welcoming
    to immigrants and other outsiders. However, Caille\nis one of the most expensive
    cities in New Eden to live in, and is often\nthe final goal for some aspiring
    migrants to the Federation.\n\nThough Caille is disproportionately prosperous,
    it is not without its\ndownsides. Behind the facade of glamor and success, a very
    amoral\nunderworld permeates Caillean society, particularly in the city's high\nculture.
    Fashion houses have often been implicated in acquiring their\nmodels from human
    traffickers, or purchased illegally from slavers. It\nremains a chronic problem,
    yet does nothing to dent Caille's reputation\nwithin the general purview, which
    some say makes the matter even more\nsinister. Similarly, crime families that
    date back many generations have\na strong sway in economic activity. While it
    is not to a level that has\nany effect on the ordinary citizen, there have been
    many cases over the\nyears of institutional corruption because of it, along with
    a series of\nhigh-profile murders, kidnappings and extortions. These darker sides
    of\nCaille have never really made much of an issue for the city or people,\nbut
    it is enough for more discerning individuals of New Eden to be\nturned off the
    city completely.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n- [Crystal Boulevard](45ZcfxzqF7v2mqmLksGxYU)\n-
