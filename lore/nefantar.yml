- body: "## History\n\n### Minmatar Empire\n\nThe Nefantar tribe originated in the
    Tronhadar Delta on the continent of Houdea on [Matar](5gheCRHTWLbi5jzbo5vvT6).
    The Nefantar have always seemed to be at the center of turbulent events in the
    history of the Minmatar. \n\nA large and powerful tribe in the early days of Matar,
    the Nefantar often came into conflict with other tribes and clans. The [Krusual
    Tribe](7KI9OEieV9sdjksayCyoGk), in particular, have historically been a special
    enemy of the Nefantar, with very little love lost between them. Some of the last
    internecine conflicts of the pre\u2013Minmatar Empire period were between the
    Krusual and the Nefantar, with only the establishment of a global polity on Matar
    damping down the last flames of open warfare. \n\nThe Nefantar were keen to participate
    fully in the politics of the Minmatar Empire and established a good working relationship
    with the other main tribes, forging particularly strong ties with the [Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw).
    When the Starkmanir left for Arzad, and became more and more absorbed with their
    own issues, the Nefantar sought to replace them as the preeminent tribe on Matar.
    \n\nThough the Nefantar did not quite reach the levels of esteem among the other
    tribes as the Starkmanir had enjoyed, but certainly their influence and prestige
    grew into the vacuum that had been left. While they did use their increased influence
    to claim the Hjoramold system, the Nefantar tribe as a whole didn't move, preferring
    instead to hold on to their new found prominence on Matar.\n\n#### Wayfarer Clans\n\nTraditionally
    not as nomadic as other Minmatar tribes, the exception among the Nefantar were
    the Wayfarer Clans. Wayfarer Clans were families that traveled extensively, often
    only returning once every few generations. One of these clans mapped the entire
    Immensea region over the course of six generations, though their name has since
    been lost to history. After the Amarr conquest began, returning Wayfarer clans
    were shocked at the change of fortune their people had experienced. Uncomfortable
    with their tribe's role in this new order, many simply headed out again, never
    to return.\n\n### Amarr Raids and Collaboration\n\nWhen the Amarr slave raiders
    first arrived on the [Day of Darkness](4pIEpmqcTQ885m2fHwzlR), the Nefantar were
    as vigorous as any of the other tribes in attempting to fight back, but in the
    aftermath of that first crushing defeat, reality set in. As one of the largest
    tribes, the Nefantar had been hit hard by the raids, and their leadership debated
    leaving Matar for their colony world of Hjoramold. In the end, the Nefantar chief
    decided against the move, despite strong support for it among influential families
    and clan leaders. The debate\u2019s aftermath left bitter divisions within the
    tribe, and the acrimony would lead many of the most powerful members of the Nefantar
    tribe to look to the protection of their own families at the expense of others.
    \n\nThe next time Amarr raiders came to Matar, they encountered no resistance
    in areas controlled by certain Nefantar families. The Amarr quickly understood
    that these members of the Nefantar elite were willing to work with them in exchange
    for immunity from the raids for their own families. Over time the collaboration
    of the Nefantar with the Amarr became widespread across Matar, as the benefits
    of the betrayal of their fellow Matari became clear.\n\nAfter a century of Amarr
    raiding, the Nefantar had become the effective rulers of what remained of the
    Minmatar people. Any open challengers to their control would quickly find themselves
    in the next quota of slaves handed over to the raiding parties. The Nefantar had
    already begun to ape their Amarr masters, abandoning many tribal ways and adopting
    an aristocratic hierarchy. Finally, just before the invasion and occupation of
    Amarr, the Nefantar moved their capital to Hjoramold, evidently with the approval
    and assistance of the Amarr. \n\n### Becoming the Ammatar\n\nSafely on Hjoramold,
    the Nefantar leadership adopted the Amarr faith and pledged their allegiance to
    the Amarr Empire. The emperor, Damius III, was so impressed he bestowed special
    privileges on the Nefantar and spoke of them as \u201CAmmatar,\u201D in acknowledgement
    of their loyalty. The Nefantar, as the Ammatar, enjoyed a very privileged relationship
    with their Amarr rulers and considerable autonomy.\n\nSafely on Hjoramold, the
    Nefantar leadership adopted the Amarr faith and pledged their allegiance to the
    Amarr Empire. A great purge was begun as every Minmatar not of their tribe was
    enslaved. The Nefantar willingly abandoned a great number of their traditions,
    claiming they had progressed beyond the old social structure of the Minmatar tribes,
    and so impressed [Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) [Damius III](4YXvIhUK7GjrXhK4dZ5AOM)
    that he granted them considerable autonomy.\n\nIn a speech announcing this favored
    status, the Emperor alluded to the Nefantar poetically as \"Ammatar\". The word
    was quickly picked by the Minmatar slave population who used it as a derogatory
    term for the tribe that had betrayed its brethren. It was also during this period
    that Tyrion Plethar was consecrated as the first Minmatar priest of the Amarr
    religion. The [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) would be the first to legally
    use the term Ammatar in one of their early drafts of the Gallente-Amarr Free Trade
    Agreement.\n\nThe Amarr poured a great deal of wealth into the Ani constellation
    in an attempt to help the Nefantar build up their infrastructure. Research centers,
    stations, trading hubs, even hospitals and cultural buildings were erected in
    a short period of time. The Nefantar inclination towards establishing and developing
    fixed centers of trade combined with Amarr underwriting soon led to an accumulation
    of vast amounts of wealth that the tribe hoarded in various locations. Many high-ranking
    Ammatar became slaveholders, and the use of space vessels was granted them. \n\nEven
    so, the Nefantar were as shocked as anyone by the annihilation of Starkman Prime.
    Perhaps even more so. The Starkmanir, after all, had been almost as privileged
    as the Nefantar, and the two tribes had maintained links even after their respective
    migrations away from Matar. Some of the Nefantar elites became convinced that
    a great crime had been carried out and were determined to save what was left of
    the Starkmanir. \n\nFrom this time on, these Nefantar families covertly gathered
    to them as many Starkmanir as they could and, under the guise of establishing
    slave colonies, placed them in areas controlled by the Nefantar. Papers were forged
    and much strong-arming and coercion were used as the Nefantar acquired a great
    number of Starkmanir slaves, hiding them in plain sight on their holdings. The
    Nefantar would later claim the protection of the Starkmanir as their primary motivation
    for siding with the Amarr during the Minmatar Rebellion.\n\n### The Great Rebellion\n\nWhile
    many small attempts had been made at revolution before, the destruction of Starkman
    Prime heightened and intensified incidents of unrest throughout the Amarr Empire.
    Ironically, the Nefantar played a role in fermenting this unrest by first exporting
    those Minmatar showing the most signs of dissidence to all corners of the Empire,
    and then hiding the fact that a fair number of Starkmanir actually survived on
    their holdings. It took two hundred and sixty-nine years for the spark set off
    by [Drupar Maak](4jYB1gA3QgB54Pi5vxP3Em) to ignite the flames of Rebellion, but
    ignite it did.\n\nThe Amarr had always been spread too thin, and with their defeat
    at the hands of the [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G), they were completely unprepared
    for the passion of the Minmatar people. However, despite the extreme success of
    the Rebellion in the vast majority of places, the Amarr still maintained a heavy
    superiority in space. Even when the Minmatar forces had taken Hek, it was still
    relatively easy for the Amarr to move their fleet around, and they answered the
    Nefantar plea for help by sending significant forces, including a capital ship,
    the *TES Reclamation*.\n\nInitially the Amarr force swept aside whole squadrons
    of rebel ships, and the governor of Ani at the time, Lord Basad, used the brief
    respite granted by the *Reclamation*'s arrival to construct a formidable fortress
    in orbit around Hjoramold XII.\n\nThe tide turned quickly for the pro-Empire forces.
    A double agent lured the Nefantar tribal leader to a remote location in the Uriok
    system and assassinated him. This act caused a massive up-swing in disruptive
    acts among those slaves still held in bondage, and mere days later a saboteur
    succeeded in destroying the *TES Reclamation* in the Traun system.\n\nWith the
    threat of the capital ship gone, the rebel fleet turned back towards Hjoramold.
    The bulk of the Amarr Fleet had been forced to pull back to quell riots closer
    to home, and the Ani constellation was now completely cut off now from the rest
    of the Empire. The Nefantar prepared to evacuate.\n\nDismantling monuments and
    relics, the Nefantar packed them up and, avoiding the jump gates, snuck them out
    of the system along with the remnants of the Starkmanir tribe. The fort constructed
    by Lord Basad came to be known as Lord Bastion during its valiant two month stand
    against the invading rebel forces. When it finally fell, the last of the Nefantar
    that were able to left Ani for good.\n\nThe Nefantar tribe were relocated to the
    Derelik region. The Molden Heath entrance to this region was through Audesder,
    at the time heavily fortified by Amarr forces and thought to be well behind the
    farthest possible advance of the rebels. As such, this was the destination system
    for the relics being moved from the Ani constellation. Ironically, the rebel forces
    did reach Audesder, and with Fort Kumar in Kenobanala proving too hard to break,
    it was the last system taken by the rebels.\n\n### The Ammatar Mandate\n\nAfter
    the Great Rebellion, the Nefantar, now almost universally known as the Ammatar,
    retreated from the Minmatar worlds with their Amarr masters. Uncertain whether
    or not the Minmatar rebels would ultimately survive, the Nefantar conspirators
    took their Starkmanir charges with them and settled them on one of the worlds
    under their control in the new buffer state the Amarr set up for them: the Ammatar
    Mandate.\n\nWith both the Amarr and the majority of the Nefantar unaware of the
    deception the tribe's leadership was undertaking in regards to the Starkmanir,
    the relationship between the Empire and its subjects in the Mandate seemed stronger
    than ever. The inadvertent discovery of the Starkmanir by the Sisters of EVE was
    a disaster that almost turned into a second genocide.\n\n### Return of the Nefantar
    and Starkmanir\n\nLate in the Year [YC110](4s7KrRaqQANTatQhzlSaRi), the secret
    the Ammatar leadership had been keeping was exposed to the whole cluster when
    the [Sisters of EVE](77ihwsVRHRojCaPC5XZn2g) announced the discovery of a large
    population of Starkmanir living within the Mandate. Fortunately, the Nefantar
    conspiracy controlled the Mandate through the governorship of Ana Utulf and was
    able to delay repercussions until the Elder Fleet invaded the Mandate and recovered
    the Starkmanir.\n\nWhile the Elder Fleet carried out its coordinated attacks designed
    to liberate the Starkmanir, Ammatar Consulate Governor [Ana Utulf](7wtM3XjsKYiuGDdDJW14Vh)
    encouraged her people to go with them. The Nefantar conspirators and their families
    led a mass defection of many Ammatar back to the Minmatar Republic at the same
    time. Not only slaves and commoners, but slave-owners and members of the [Ammatar
    Navy](3as0Qu7kajUNvkjJdBSwF1) defected. In fact, it was the Ammatar Navy defectors
    who first provided a clue to what was happening when they altered their ship transponder
    signals to identify themselves as \"Nefantar Tribe\" vessels.\n\n### Nefantar
    in the Republic \nWith some of the slaves freed by [Jamyl Sarum's](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L)
    proclamation returning to the Republic along with the Starkmanir, [Thukker](3uoxvtJY1Z30BoVwuJLj2z),
    and the Nefantar, it was the Nefantar who seemed to be getting the shortest end
    of the stick. \n\nThe ancestral lands of the Thukker and Starkmanir on Matar had
    been held in trust, but no such accommodation had been made for the Nefantar.
    Court cases, and other land disputes, along with rising religious tensions have
    made it difficult for the Nefantar refugees, some of whom had left relatively
    opulent lives and positions of power in the Mandate.\n\nToday, the Nefantar tribe
    has been restored as one of the Seven Tribes of Matar, even while many of their
    bloodline remain loyal to the Amarr Empire. The Nefantar chose Eleca Valkanir
    as their chief in YC115.\n"
