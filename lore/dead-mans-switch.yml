- body: 'A **dead man''s switch** is a type of implant that knocks its owner

    unconscious when activated. When set off with a specially prepared,

    deliberately focused EMP bomb, it knocks the wearer out and erases

    recent memories. It is not healthy for the wearer, and often doesn''t

    work as well as it should. It has a unique requirement that the victim

    needs to feel like they died at the time of the memory wipe. Otherwise,

    the risk of irreversible psychosis rises steeply.
