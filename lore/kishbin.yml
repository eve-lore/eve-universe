- body: '**Kishbin** was a CEO of

    [Sukuuvestaa Corporation](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB). He disapproved of the

    close relationship between [David](3H01yyv6huJ5QjGhvOP55j), the then-CEO of [Kaalakiota](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK),
    and Kand Yonate, the

    former CFO of Sukuuvestaa, and worked to demolish both men. In order to

    keep the two from releasing a joint project, he demanded David procure

    100 units of a rare mineral. David produced 200, further enraging

    Kishbin. Eventually, he began making moves to purchase SuVee shares and

    eject David from his position, leading David to hide his shares in

    shadow accounts. Kishbin then brought corruption charges against the

    men, which held weight because of David''s shadow accounts. The two men

    resigned rather than be formally tried.
