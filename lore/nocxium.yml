    one of the vital ingredients for [capsule](2klMsyfd5quK05XnGL9wNB) production.
    Due to the fact that this strange matter forms only during supernovas, it can
    only be found in a few exclusive regions. As the nocxium breaks down when under
    intense heat and pressure, it only exists in asteroid fields and not in larger
    stellar objects. A few years ago numerous asteroids containing nocxium were discovered
    in the extensive Miennue [Outer Ring](76XHDOSsVTEcKoz8b0QuNt) just outside the
    jurisdiction of the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK), propelling
    the otherwise desolate cloud ring into the international political limelight.
    \n\n\n### Rarity and ORE excavation\nThousands of prospectors have flocked to
    Miennue since nocxium was first discovered there, but as always only a handful
    reap the rewards of their efforts. [Yani Sar Arteu](5Hr0XePLMfBW8OLWbVbgUu) was
    one of the few to hit the jackpot big time. He and his small company named [Outer
    Ring Excavations](vtyIqELC7ngvFuWla7baP) recently stumbled across an asteroid
    reportedly containing the biggest nocxium deposit ever found in this region. Although
    rumors abound nothing has been confirmed, as only Arteu and his companions have
    seen this alleged super-asteroid and are not about to disclose its location. In
    fact, they only spend the minority of their time actually mining the asteroid,
    hunting it down on weekly excavation expeditions. This is because they don\u2019t
    want to flood the market with nocxium, thus bringing down the price. In between,
    they spend their energy playing elaborate games of hide-and-seek with jealous
    competitors eager to get their hands on the asteroid.\n\n\n### Continued ORE dominance\nThe
    empires monitor the goings-on in Miennue closely and all of them have made both
    overt and covert proposals to Outer Ring Excavations, offering security for a
    stake in the company. Outer Ring Excavations have rejected all these offers, but
    ever-increasing pressure from competitors is making it harder and harder for them
    to keep their secret safe much longer. Sooner or later, one of the numerous methods
    employed by those pursuing the asteroid -- bribes, threats, tracking devices,
    bugs -- is bound to unveil the secret that Arteu has so meticulously kept concealed.
    In the meantime, Arteu and Outer Ring Excavations are getting richer -- fantastically
    so -- by the minute. \n\n\n### See Also\n* [Outer Ring Excavations](38pEfgwJxyeFUuqMgpTLZ)"
