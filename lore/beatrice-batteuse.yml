    Garoun in YC110 at 30 years old, following her father's decision to undergo euthanasia.\n\nEns\xEE
    Beatrice broke familial tradition within the year by making surprise public appearances
    in several local arts events, academic symposiums, and on one occasion, a child's

    suffered complications due to an autoimmune disease during a diplomatic trip to
    Intaki. Ens\xEE Beatrice ceased making public appearances shortly after.\n\nIn
    YC120, Ens\xEE Beatrice remarried Doctor Jeras Alaila, a professor at the local
    branch of the University of Caille and former executive of the [Sukuuvestaa Corporation](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB).

    media coverage](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/gallente-royal-destroys-local-divine-in-freestyle-verse-exchange-gets-married/),
    and many speculated that it may signal Ens\xEE Beatrice's return to the public
    sphere."
