- body: "The **Gallente Federation is a treaty-based interstellar community** of semi-independent
    and autonomous nations, planets and solar systems, based on a democratic and libertarian
    system. Officially the Federated Union of Gallente Prime, [Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK)
    government itself functions as a supranational authority that promotes and protects
    individual rights, free economies, and democratic governance across the stars.
    As a [democracy](50Q1BNUHpwZCZBn7VqBL18), it is unique in the sense that ultimate
    power rests with the Federation\u2019s peoples, who actively participate in the
    political process. Its existence as a pluralistic union of nations has created
    a level of social, cultural, and political diversity unseen anywhere else in [New
    Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk).\n\n### History\nThe Gallente\u2019s habit for progressive
    government and constant reform has resulted in the different eras of Federation
    politics being grouped by academics into so-called \u2018Unions\u2019.\n\n####
    First Union\nThe First Union is synonymous with the founding of the Gallente Federation
    in 23121AD. The union was designed to cultivate interplanetary trade and space
    development as the sole representative body of humanity, created as a replacement
    of the various diplomatic agreements that had existed for several centuries prior.
    The founding members were the nations of the Gallente, [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy),
    [Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn), and [Mannar](4BaMCkOwYaPpd4ZMtEfEY) homeworlds,
    signing the treaty known as the Federal Charter. Other members would join over
    time (such as the [Achura](4zhtMkBDe0W8xX2ihsfnik)), but would lack the size or
    influence of the founding races.\n\nThis incarnation of the Federation was very
    loose in structure, acting as a supraplanetary colonial alliance that was mostly
    concerned with interstellar economic affairs and trade, though it would operate
    a  as a peacekeeping armada. Post-nationalism and post-racialism were two of its
    founding principles, and thus the Federation did not regard itself as a nation
    in the traditional sense (given contact with the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
    had yet to be established). At this time, the government was composed only of
    a [Senate](x8brOPuT22Bcly2Sikkt5), with representatives appointed by the Federation\u2019s
    member governments. Internally, Senators would elect a [President](UW2GqozmvYnsm1kRPpp1E)
    from their ranks, who would be able to exhibit some executive powers.\n\n####
    Second Union\nThe Second Union came about not long after the invention of [Faster
    Than Light Communication](7Eqc0yOgUoUswOop0Q2uMQ) in 23146AD. The establishment
    of FTL relays across the Federation allowed popular democracy to take place at
    an interstellar level, which was previously considered a logistical impossibility.
    Eventually, the Federal Charter was amended so that voting by universal suffrage
    would elect one-third of the members of the Federation Senate, rising to half
    within the following years.\n\nThe creation of a Luminaire-dominated interstellar
    media network would cultivate the notion of \u2018human rights\u2019 across the
    member planets of the Federation. Member nations would often bypass the Federal
    government to sanction or penalize \u2018unsavory\u2019 states directly, as the
    Federation had no legal basis to intervene in planetary affairs. As this proved
    disharmonious, a Constitution was eventually created that would outline and protect
    the rights for every single citizen. The Federal Charter was amended to recognize
    the treaty to be binding across all member nations.\n\nMany academics consider
    the Second Union to be the first step to the Federation taking on the concept
    of traditional nationhood, something that was previously considered outdated and
    anachronistic by many. The Constitution\u2019s use of the term \u2018Federation
    citizen\u2019 for the first time pointed to this notion.\n\n#### Third Union\nAfter
    the departure of the Caldari from Luminaire in 23156AD following the outbreak
    of the [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV), the Federation underwent
    a series of reforms to prevent a further political calamity from occurring a second
    time. In order to avoid future divisions, a standardized system of democracy implemented
    at the interstellar level would be see as one of the means to this ideal, deemphasizing
    the focus on nations using the Federation as a forum to compete against one another.\n\nThe
    Third Union created the modern day three pillar system, composed of an executive,
    legislative, and judicial branches. Each would have clear separation of powers
    to prevent totalitarian forces from wrestling control of the government. Rather
    than being elected from the Senate, the President would occupy a separate executive
    branch, as the nominal head of the newly-established [Federal Administration](3FvIDT7Y2mQEOOCLVpy3kz).
    Every Federation citizen past the age of suffrage would be entitled to vote for
    the President every five years. The Senate would occupy the legislative branch,
    now fully elected (again every five years) rather than half of the chamber being
    appointed by member nations. Finally, the judicial branch was composed of a [Supreme
    Court](6gOOivEzFVq2cUAKDvKZEQ), which would protect and uphold the Federation
    Charter and Constitution.\n\nDistricts were also created as a product of the Third
    Union, in response to protests from colonies of the Federation member nations
    that did not have representation in the Senate. Member nations were no longer
    permitted to operate colonies outside of their home constellation, effectively
    granting these vassal territories full independence from their motherlands. Instead,
    newly-created districts (each taking up a constellation for the most part) would
    be granted its own parliament and court for the member states to consolidate under.
    Member states could use these Federation-recognized districts to deal with local
    issues and advise the Senate as a collective entity.\n\nRather than representing
    their home countries, Senators would now represent districts instead. It was to
    be emphasized that politicians at the Federation level were to be representatives
    of the people regardless of member state. Signatory nations would now use their
    district parliaments rather than the Federation as localized interstellar forums.\n\nFurther
    appeasement came with the granting of certain member states the power of \u2018opt-out\u2019,
    which allowed territories to refuse to take part in elements of the Federation\u2019s
    laws. Some considered this to be a knee-jerk and paranoid response to possible
    union instabilities, even unjust as citizens from opted-out territories could
    still vote in Federation elections yet not be subject to all its laws. Member
    nations in the Luminaire and Intaki solar systems would have the most opt-outs.
    The [Jin-Mei](6SFvK45QIlCCCoNODY3gUB) nation would be granted opt-outs to protect
    its caste system when it joined the Federation in 23174AD.\n\n#### Fourth Union\nThe
    Fourth Union emerged following the social, cultural, and political shocks of encountering
    the Amarr Empire in 23180AD. No longer the sole interstellar civilization of humanity
    in known space, doubts were raised amongst its members, considering the possibility
    that subscribing to democracy was not a compulsory requirement for ascending into
    the stars. Reforms would be undertaken to maintain unity in the face of the Amarr.\n\nA
    movement emerged, concerned with reviving the once-discarded concepts of nationhood
    to implement across the entire Federation. Portions of this movement emphasized
    the Federation as a \u201Cnation of nations\u201D (rather than just an alliance),
    while other segments focused more on individuals. Federal citizens came to regard
    the Empire as a corrupt, oppressive tyranny eager to stamp out other cultures,
    and that only through [slavery](slavery) and heavy-handedness had it emerged so
    large. In some circles, the Federation would still be seen as the only representative
    of human civilization, with the Amarr Empire deemed as enemies of mankind altogether.\n\nThrough
    this movement, the Senate passed a series of laws in order to appear as a more
    cohesive entity before the Amarr Empire. A system of general taxation would be
    introduced (prior to this, founder nation funding and trade tariffs were the primary
    sources of Federal revenue). Though the introduction of taxation was immensely
    unpopular at first, member state funding was abolished, resulting in lowered local
    taxes. This meant that the average citizen would pay no more than they usually
    would, ultimately quelling protests. Trade tariffs were lowered, stimulating further
    trade between Federation members.\n\nThe new laws would generally limit and curb
    the spacefaring powers of planetary nations somewhat, with the exclusion of those
    in the home systems. Member state militaries no longer being able to operate beyond
    their respective nation\u2019s boundaries was one notable law. Smaller protocols
    were introduced, such as starship licenses granted by planetside bodies no longer
    being recognized, only documentation given to space captains by the Federation.
    To enforce the new laws and protocols, an interstellar gendarmerie known as the
    Federal Police was created, taking the best of the best from local planetary and
    system law enforcement agencies. FedPol (alternatively the more colloquial \u2018Gallente
    Police Department\u2019, or GPD) fell under the judicial branch, becoming the
    enforcer of the new \u2018Federal Law\u2019 that was emerging.\n\n#### Fifth Union\nThe
    Fifth Union started with the founding of CONCORD in 23233AD, and became further
    realized after peace was signed with the Caldari in YC12. The creation of an international
    system where the Federation was just one of five major nations saw the union take
    a different approach to decades prior, focusing more on internal affairs rather
    than stellar expansion.\n\nAs territorial expansion of the major factions had
    effectively halted in the wake of CONCORD\u2019s founding, the Federation looked
    to developing large tracts of its space that had been ignored up until this point.
    Eventually, the groundwork for a welfare program would be laid out, where the
    Federation government would start handing out financial aid to planetary governments
    or individuals to assist in local development or alleviate poverty. The end of
    the war and the subsequent slashing of the military budget gave the Federal government
    plenty of capital to invest in development projects across its territories, and
    generally work to improve quality of living for the first time.\n\nSuccessors
    of President [Aidonis Elabon](3IcoxAofkzoA9VQJbk5mPE) failed to live up to the
    high standard that he had set. Presidents in this era became puppets of the various
    political alliances working behind the scenes, and while most acted independently,
    they always did so within the strict framework set by these groups. As a result,
    they became perceived as weaklings who could not think or act for themselves,
    frequently brow-beaten by the Senate. Instead, it was the Senate that began to
    see itself as the true leader of the Federation.\n\nThe atomization of Federal
    politics between hundreds of Senators resulted in lobbyist factions pushing through
    the use of electronic referenda to utilize public opinion, believing in a more
    open democracy for all. However, the negligible interaction an everyday citizen
    has with the Federation combined with the fact the central government primarily
    legislates on spaceside affairs would result in extremely low turnouts for these
    referenda, averaging around 10% each time.\n\nThe Fifth Union\u2019s focus on
    social and planetary development would see a political alliance called the Social
    Democrats (or Sociocrats) emerge as the main political force in the Federation
    for that time. The Sociocrats advocate social equality on all levels, believing
    that the Federal government\u2019s highest priority is to aid underdeveloped member
    worlds and those in the lower stratas of the Gallente societies. This came at
    the cost of planetary autonomy and the more laissez-faire approaches of the Federation.
    Towards the end of the Fifth Union, the welfare system would break down when supporting
    it became uneconomical, especially when corrupt planetary governments would hoard
    the aid for themselves rather than distribute it to their constituents. Over time,
    the more individualistic-focused Progressors would become the largest alliance,
    slightly ahead of the Sociocrats.\n\n#### Sixth Union\nThe Sixth Union began with
    the election of President Souro Foiritan in YC103. The era would be characterized
    by the rise of big personalities amongst the Federal government and the significant
    increase of member autonomy previously curbed under the Sociocrats. It also saw
    the creation of the constitutionally questionable [Black Eagles](6eVk3icIk4UHf5Uh799xDN).\n\nAlthough
    President Souro Foiritan was elected as a Progressor in YC103, his first action
    was to expel his main competitors from the alliance, and subsequently distance
    himself from the faction in following years. The President did not intend to be
    a puppet of the alliances, and proceeded to overturn the popular perception that
    the Senate were the true leaders of the Federation by using his charisma and shrewd
    intelligence. Not since Aidonis Elabon a century ago had a big personality arisen
    in Gallente politics, causing Souro Foiritan to be one of the most popular Presidents
    in Federation history.\n\nTo counterbalance President Foiritan\u2019s charisma,
    Head Senator Mentas Blaque would rise as his main rival. The Senate as a whole,
    in order to compete and contrast with Foiritan\u2019s populism, became a champion
    of megacorporate and entrenched interests for its main source of support. This
    would turn Federation politics into a spectacle of competing personalities and
    ideologies. However, the massive increases of member and citizen autonomy under
    President Foiritan meant that such trends on the Federal stage would rarely affect
    the average citizen. The Supreme Court, as the impartial arbiter of the Federation,
    would regularly intervene to prevent the spectacle from threatening the core principles
    of the union.\n\nOne major constitutional change pushed through by Souro Foiritan
    was that Presidents can now be elected for a maximum of two terms. It was widely
    considered that a single five-year term rule was an outdated concept in the contemporary
    era, and was simply not long enough for a President to have any lasting effects
    on the massive bureaucracy the Federation had become.\n\nPresident Jacus Roden,
    elected in YC111, would be another so-called big personality President, though
    he is considered much more of a pragmatist than a populist. He would continue
    the trend of the previous administration to increase citizen and member autonomy,
    while using the Black Eagles to defactionalize the Federal government and serve
    as an intervention force. The spectacle that had defined Federation politics in
    previous years has been subsiding through Roden\u2019s policy of tightening control
    of the executive and legislative branches, castrating the power of alliances\nand
    politically eliminating any other potential \u2018big personalities\u2019.\n\nJacus
    Roden\u2019s extensive knowledge of Federal Law means that the President has been
    able to work his way around the system to avoid the Supreme Court intervening
    to declare his methods as illegal or unlawful. Indeed, one of President Roden\u2019s
    key policies is to unite the three branches by eradicating the self-aggrandizing
    politics of the previous administration. Many critics point out that it is an
    irony that the Federation could only remain solvent in the face of record levels
    of freedom and autonomy (almost equal and in some parts exceeding First Union
    standards) thanks to the existence of the Black Eagles, who seem ever ready to
    remove destabilizing elements who would exploit their newfound liberties.\n\n###
    Treaties\nThe core of the Federation is its Charter, and its Constitution to a
    slightly lesser extent. Unlike other empires, power in the Federation ascends
    from the bottom, rather than being dictated top down. Thus, if all signatories
    withdrew from the Charter, then the Federation would cease to exist, at least
    in theory. On the other hand, as the Constitution identifies individuals existing
    as citizens of the Federation independent of its member states, the solvency of
    the union is a unique question amongst academics.\n\n#### Federation Charter\nThe
    Federation Charter is the founding document of the union. It stipulates the creation
    of an interstellar alliance of nations, planets and colonies for three main purposes;\n\n-
    Regulation of free and fair trade between its signatories\n- Facilitation of peaceful
    stellar expansion for its signatories\n- Promotion of democratic governance amongst
    its signatories\n\nThe Charter outlines the powers and limitations of the Federation
    government, the rights of each member state, and the expectations of each signatory.
    There are three core requirements of joining the Federation, outlined by the Charter.
    The first is that the economy of a member state must not be closed to free trade
    with other signatories. The second is that the government of a member state must
    be democratic, with regular elections and universal suffrage. The third requirement
    was added later with the introduction of a Constitution, stipulating that the
    society of a member state must respect and abide by the latter document\u2019s
    articles.\n\nOutside of these three core requirements, a member state is free
    to govern itself as it wishes, although Federal Law takes supremacy over local
    politics. This has given the territories of the Federation an unrivalled level
    of political diversity, to the point that the trappings of a government in Placid
    would be completely different to its counterpart in [Solitude](mQjw4DzdzeHF8rNpzaZKr).\n\nThe
    benefits of Charter membership are many, though the two considered the most desirable
    is the opportunity to compete economically and the ability to exploit Federal
    representation for local benefit. Military and diplomatic protection is another
    major benefit for signatories less concerned with central participation.\n\n####
    Federation Constitution\nThe Constitution of the Federation was created some years
    after the invention of FTL communications. Although not a founding document, it
    is nonetheless binding for all member states and citizens to abide by. It stipulates
    that the Federation be founded on a system of semi-direct democracy, and on the
    values of equality, justice and freedom. The document is designed to be politically
    neutral and a human universal, independent of culture and history (though plenty
    do not deny it is simply an extension of ideas taken from [Gallente Prime](41JbD6M3Keq024T44ULv7a))\n\nThe
    Constitution has titles in the following order;\n\n- **Dignity**: Human dignity
    is inviolable. Articles primarily concern the physical and mental integrity of
    the individual, and the outlawing of slavery.\n- **Freedom**: Right to liberty.
    Includes right of (such as thought, identity, and religion), right to (such as
    education, privacy, and expression), and right from (such as persecution, censorship,
    and expulsion). Also covers the right to self-determination, notably including
    articles on territorial freedoms.\n- **Equality**: Everyone is equal before the
    law. Enforces non-discrimination and respects cultural, religious, and linguistic
    diversity.\n- **Justice**: Fairness and impartiality in the justice systems. Concerns
    the right to a free trial, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and
    that penalties must be proportionate to the offences committed.\n- **Solidarity**:
    Freedoms of citizens within larger social structures. Protects the rights of workers,
    consumers, and families. Entitles citizens to social assistance and healthcare.
    Enforces environmental protection in the interests of social comfort.\n- **Citizenship**:
    Right to political participation. Articles regarding the right to vote and stand
    as a political candidate, the right to good governance, the right to petition,
    and the freedom of movement and residence.\n\nThe Constitution also has a seventh
    title regarding the interpretation and application of the document. The Gallente,
    when proposing the creation of a constitution and having centuries worth of experience
    in democracy themselves, were fully aware of the issues with how such a document
    can be twisted for personal agendas. Because each citizen and politician interprets
    liberty in their own way, the Constitution is careful to ensure that the individual
    freedoms given by the Federation do not involve the freedom to oppress other individuals,
    which is a constant political and legal issue in the union. Articles in this section
    ensure that the constitutional freedoms cannot be abused, nor can they be disproportionately
    taken out of scope or context.\n\nThe existence of such a constitution is unique
    across the four empires. Its emphasis on the rights of the individual over the
    rights of governments is what attracts millions of immigrants to the Federation
    each year. Indeed, those who have spent any significant amount of time in the
    Federation (or outside of it) often reportedly begin to feel that the levels of
    freedoms provided by the Constitution makes the other empires appear irredeemably
    oppressive and totalitarian.\n\n### Members\nThe Federation is composed of tens
    of thousands of member states that are organized into 62 constellation-sized districts.
    Colonies, an important building block of the contemporary Federation, slot into
    this structure with their own set of liberties and laws. In addition to these
    two types of member territories, there are also special city-states called registered
    megalopoli, and territories that are under direct Federal control (known as FCTs).
    The member state is the first point of interaction and identification for the
    vast majority of citizens, with the Federation government having secondary or
    tertiary relevance at best, if one at all. \n\nThe member states are libertarian
    in nature, meaning they are expected to take full responsibility for all their
    own affairs, and are assumed to conduct themselves in a way that abides by and
    is not in direct violation of any interstellar protocols. The central Federation
    authority and other bodies are available to assist a member state in fulfilling
    these responsibilities (but only when remit is granted), or punish should they
    fail to live up to the standard. Outside of following democratic principles, the
    member states are proscribed no method of self-governance. While this has given
    member states a very large amount of freedom and diversity, it equally results
    in widespread divisiveness due to the political relativism present in the system.
    This has created a paradox where a member state's pursuit of freedom and security
    may undermine another's, or even the wider whole.\n\n#### Signatories\nThe member
    signatories of the Federation compose the fundamental administrative makeup of
    the union. They are smaller nations that have agreed to abide by the laws and
    principles of the Charter and Constitution in exchange for the political, economic,
    and military benefits of Federation membership. In many ways, each member nation
    can be considered sovereign or independent insofar as its level of self-governance,
    although neither CONCORD nor the other empires recognize the constituent nations
    of the Federation to be independent. This comes despite the fact that member states
    can be extremely distinct from one another, having their own language, culture,
    and customs.\n\n##### Territorial\nFederation member signatories vary in size.
    There is generally a preference towards higher levels of territorial fragmentation
    in the Federation, as larger authorities suffer a negative stigma for being seen
    as homogenizing and bureaucratically cumbersome (thus perceived as authoritarian).\n\nIn
    relatively newer areas of the Federation, member nations are found as entire solar
    systems. This may involve a single planet that claims authority to the whole system
    and all colonies within it, to smaller nations that come together to form a single
    solar union. The smallest nations are found as individual territories on planets,
    from island-states to continental confederations. This is common in areas settled
    before the Federation\u2019s founding, particularly on homeworlds such as Gallente
    Prime, Caldari Prime, and Intaki. These historical legacy states were founded
    centuries before the Federation, or even centuries before spaceflight in the case
    of a homeworld. They are not just found on the major homeworlds, and can be found
    as minor civilizations as well. \n\nOther types of planetary nations are territories
    that declared their independence from a larger government (a practice which is
    mostly bloodless and protected by the Federal Charter). In many cases, worlds
    colonized by a single state can proceed to fragment into multiple territories
    once the planet has been settled and/or developed in full. If large enough, certain
    artificial habitats (in space or otherwise) can be categorized as member signatories.\n\n#####
    Political\nA Federation member state's government and political format must be
    democratic in some form or another. So long as a system abides by certain rules
    (eg. universal suffrage and regular elections), any type of government imaginable
    is permitted in the system. This gives member states the freedom to construct
    a government that reflects their indigenous culture. Ancient areas of Gallente
    Prime (or neo-classical Gallente nations elsewhere) can be constitutional or elective
    monarchies. Recently elevated civilizations can use a tribal parliamentary system.
    Future-minded communities may experiment with a digital form of government.\n\nTrends
    indicate that the level of technology available to a member nation influences
    its execution of democracy. Advanced countries may use direct democracy or variations
    thereof (such as demarchy or consensus), while countries that aren\u2019t as developed
    rely on representative forms of democracy. The level of education plays a similar
    role, with better-educated societies showing greater inclination to direct democracy.
    Either way, all are built on the assumption that each system is ultimately accountable
    to the people.\n\n##### Diplomatic\nMember states reserve the right to engage
    in diplomatic agreements with other members as well as the Federation itself.
    Travel and trade agreements are the most common, and there is generally little
    limitation on how member states can interact. Member states reserve the right
    to refuse any sort of outside presence in their borders, and are under no obligation
    to cooperate with one another or the central government whatsoever (assuming there
    is no breach of Federation treaties). A [franchise system](7nwbW8LIvwRIDCFoi2E6vX)
    is used by member states to delegate out various responsibilities to outside bodies
    regarding the economic activities of their wider solar system, as it is generally
    considered that member states are too weak to engage in interstellar development
    on their own.\n\nEven if member states have the power to theoretically defy central
    authorities outright, doing so can potentially sour relations with other signatories.
    Cooperation is encouraged in the name of promoting interstellar harmony. By tradition,
    it is assumed that if a member state is not interested in cooperating with their
    neighbors, then they would have not signed the Charter in the first place. The
    agreement to this collective goal is one element that keeps the Federation relatively
    cohesive. Isolationism is more than tolerated, so long as that member state does
    not attempt to impose itself on others.\n\nThough most member states have their
    own armed forces, they are restricted from sending them beyond their designated
    territories unless they are a participant of the Federation Army. For interstellar
    defense, member states delegate out the Federation Navy or other reputable outfit.
    This does not come from any legal obligation, but more as a practice of tradition
    and habit.\n\n##### Economic\nMember states rely heavily on trade with one another
    for their economic affairs. All member states must be open to free and fair trade.
    A member state may specialize in one product to export, or rely completely on
    imports. Generally, there is a complex weave of economic interdependency across
    the member states, and it has been said numerous times that it is this particular
    reality that has kept the union cohesive in the face of the massive social and
    political divisions that characterize the Federation. Other member states may
    prefer to be self-sufficient, treating the Federation as nothing more than a trade
    organization. Member states who are economically influential (especially those
    found in a major home system) are notorious for being able to leverage greater
    rights than what traditions would typically allow.\n\n##### Legal\nThe laws of
    a member state are their own, but they must not be in violation of Federal Law.
    Moreover, member states are expected to pass their own laws that reflect any legislation
    made by the Federation government. This enhances the perception of a member state's
    freedom, as they are able to implement the Federation's wide-sweeping legislation
    in forms that are compatible with the culture and society of their jurisdiction.
    This has given the reputation of the Federation government being a very distant
    entity; even if the majority of a member state's laws are derived from higher
    authorities, they will appear to be a product of the local government. Member
    states who fail to abide by Federal Law are either fined or placed under economic
    sanction, though they can appeal to the Supreme Court in such instances.\n\nA
    certain number of member states are designated as having the power of opt-out
    by the Federation government. This means that these signatories can refuse to
    take part in any aspects of the Federation\u2019s laws. This is highly controversial
    for a number of reasons, as citizens from opt-out territories can still vote in
    Federation elections, leading to criticisms regarding political inequality. Opt-outs
    are deemed as necessary for appeasing nations who do not perceive themselves as
    compatible with the Federation, yet their continued membership is seen as critical
    to the union\u2019s wellbeing. \n\nThe most notable example of a signatory with
    the power of opt-out is the nation of Jin-Mei. The Jin-Mei are regarded as key
    financial players in the Federation yet have opted-out of clauses that compromise
    their caste system. Other signatories with the most opt-outs reside mainly in
    the Luminaire and Intaki solar systems. Special ruling can override an opt-out
    in theory, but the severe and potentially fatal backlash this would cause means
    this has never been done in Federation history.\n\n#### Colonies\nThe member colonies
    of the Federation are considered one of the union\u2019s main building blocks.
    Many Federation signatories were once colonies that acquired independence to become
    a nation unto itself. Colonies fall under various different administrations depending
    on who they have been established by and where they have been founded. The largest
    and most successful colonies tend to be those settled by member states themselves,
    followed by corporate settlements.\n\nAs all colonies must be democratic, a colonial
    government is typically composed of an elected director and their staff. As the
    size of the colony expands, more advanced government trappings may be adopted.
    Their administrative style and format tend to follow the mother culture of the
    colony.\n\n##### Government and Corporate Colonies\nColonies established by member
    states have various rights entitled to them by the Federal Charter. Their mother
    nation is expected to take care of military protection and ensure that the rights
    of these colonists are identical to the citizens living back home. If a colony
    and/or its citizens feel it is not being taken care of by its home country, it
    can protest to the local district court or the Federal Supreme Court with its
    grievances.\n\nCorporations who wish to establish a colony typically have to acquire
    permission to do so from the nearest authority, either a member state or district
    government. Colonies established beyond the borders of the Federation who desire
    political representation and/or association are accountable solely to Federal
    Law.\n\n##### Independent Colonies\nIndependent colonies established by non-governmental
    and non-corporate groups or individuals can exist in unclaimed areas, particularly
    in so-called \u2018unorganized systems\u2019(where no member states reside). They
    may peripherally tie themselves to or freely associate with a member state elsewhere
    (through trade or paying taxes for example) in exchange for political representation
    and/or other benefits. Many of these independent colonies forgo paying taxes altogether,
    thus lacking any political representation. These types of colonies can be controversial
    in the Federation, particularly settlements established by immigrant groups (such
    as [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) clans or former Amarr slaves). Local laws
    and opinions on them vary greatly.\n\nFounding colonies in areas already inhabited
    by previously unknown indigenous groups (such as planetary tribes) is a problematic
    practice in the Federation. Unlike other empires, the Federation considers all
    individuals on its planets as entitled to citizenship by default, especially individuals
    who have always resided on a world. Nonetheless, long legal battles have been
    conducted by colonists who feel their rights as frontierspeople are greater than
    those of \u2018uncivilized\u2019 birth. No clear law has emerged on this practice.\n\n#####
    Capsuleer Colonies\nA new development as of YC112, colonies run by independent
    capsuleers in the Federation are founded by negotiating with the local member
    state (or district in the case of an unorganized system), either by the capsuleer
    personally or a representative. They may be staffed by local citizens. In instances
    when the affected authority is unhappy with the colony\u2019s establishment (even
    with the ISK involved in the equation), the colony would be inhabited by drones
    and/or off-worlders instead.\n\nThere are reports of independent capsuleers threatening
    member states reluctant to allow capsuleer operations in their borders with orbital
    bombardment. The Federation has since gone out of its way to remind its signatories
    that these attempts at coercions are bluffs, and that the sovereignty of a member
    planet is not at the dictat of independent capsuleers.\n\n##### Ascension\nOnce
    a colony reaches a certain size, it can apply to the Federal Administration to
    become a full member signatory of the Charter. A colony must consider whether
    the benefits of becoming a full Federation member outweigh the downsides. Often,
    a home nation or its controlling corporation may not want to relinquish authority
    of their colony vassal for various economic or political reasons, and frequently
    attempt to do everything in its power to prevent the colony from ascending to
    full membership. Capsuleer colonies are unlikely to ascend at this present time,
    due to the fact that few have been founded with any sense of permanency. This
    is the main process that previously uninhabited areas of the Federation have achieved
    full political franchise and representation.\n\n#### Registered Megalopoli\nA
    registered megalopolis is a special planetside city that is entitled to autonomy
    independent of the district and member state it is enclaved by. Effectively city-states
    that wield enough economic and political influence that rival entire solar systems,
    many registered megalopoli are considered microcosms of the wider Federation.
    These cities are highly cosmopolitan, well-travelled, and well-integrated with
    New Eden\u2019s economy.\n\nRegistered megapoli universally use a three branch
    system, composed of a mayor, city council, and local court. They are also counted
    as a sub-district, granting it a single seat on the Federation Senate. Becoming
    a registered megalopolis is no easy feat, and it is possible for the Federation
    to revoke the prestigious status if the city does not live up to the standard
    expected.\n\n[Hueromont](1PzpjLA0ZHtQRZu2f8x4gO) and Des Ponticelles are two of
    the most well-known registered megalopoli in the Federation, having never lost
    the status. Although [Caille](73TXaac6RTgSJaqJHkTxCz) is far more of a major political
    and economic player than these two cities, it has never submitted itself to become
    a registered megapolis, preferring to remain the capital of its ancient Garoun
    state.\n\n#### FCTs\nFederally-Controlled Territories (or FCTs) are under the
    direct control of the Federation government. The capitals of the Federation are
    FCTs, as well as the Gallente Border Zone constellation. Smaller FCTs exist across
    Federation space, mostly military bases or prisons. The Federation must negotiate
    to establish an FCT in a territory already under the control of another authority.
    In the case of the capitals, the Federation often devolves powers to smaller areas
    for the purposes of bureaucratic ease. Unlike the rest of the Federation, these
    powers are not protected, and can be revoked by the central government at any
    time.\n\n### Branches\nThe responsibilities of the central Federation government,
    or FedGov, are the following;\n\n- Representation of all Federation nations and
    citizens to non-signatories\n- Maintenance of the union's cohesion for the benefit
    of all Federation participants\n- Promotion of the articles present in the Federation's
    founding treaties\n\nEffectively, FedGov is an interstellar regulatory body that
    binds the union together by executing and upholding the values laid out in the
    Federation Charter and Constitution. It is made up of a three branch system composed
    of an executive, legislature, and judiciary, all with clear separation of powers.
    The intent of this system is to prevent one arm from gaining undue influence over
    the affairs of either the other two branches, the wider Federation, or both. There
    are as many as three capitals to symbolically emphasize this principle, although
    Villore IV (better known as Libertopolis) is the symbolic capital world.\n\nThe
    Federation government operates on a semi-direct or hybrid democratic system. The
    intent of this is to strike a balance between the flaws of both full direct and
    full representative systems, where the former may see the oppression of minorities
    by majorities, and the latter may result in an oligarchy that only superficially
    interacts with its constituents. While the Federal government has very rarely
    fallen to either extreme wholesale, it has exhibited tendencies in different areas
    to varying degrees occasionally throughout its history. While turnouts for public
    referenda at the Federal level is only 10% on average (which can throw the legitimacy
    of these votes into question), it is generally accepted that citizens who do participate
    are those who will be the most affected by the outcome.\n\nCompared to the interstellar
    governments of other empires, the Federation government has no influence on the
    average citizen, at least not without going through many layers of separation.
    This is because FedGov's power is mostly military or economic in nature. While
    this ensures that individual and social freedoms are protected from off-world
    influence, it does mean that enforcement against violations of such may be lax.
    It is the member states who are entrusted with carrying forward the Federal government\u2019s
    decisions to their respective citizens. The extremely light touch the Federation
    has on its citizens has resulted in the low rates of political participation at
    the interstellar level.\n\n#### Executive\nThe President heads up the executive
    branch, which is primarily composed of his or her cabinet and the [Federal Administration](3FvIDT7Y2mQEOOCLVpy3kz).
    Elections for the President run every five years, and can only be re-elected once.
    The executive branch is in charge of executing and implementing the law in the
    spirit of the Federation\u2019s principles. The President is the Chief of Command
    of the Federation armed forces.\n\nThe Office of the President is located in the
    Federation executive capital of Ladistier, with auxiliary offices found in Parts.
    The flag of the President is represented by an eagle on a green background with
    a single diagonal stripe. The eagle stands for the citizen in both Gallente and
    Caldari cultures (albeit the citizen as a free individual in the former and the
    citizen as a part of the flock in the latter), while the green coloring is designed
    to represent moral integrity. The single stripe is a gesture of an oath.\n\n#####
    Responsibilities\nThe responsibilities of the President are the following;\n\n-
    Execution of all the union\u2019s laws and treaties in the spirit of the Federation\u2019s
    founding principles\n- Defense of all human life from both natural and man-made
    threats\n- Ambassadorship of the Federation government on behalf of her participants
    to non-signatories\n\nThe President\u2019s first responsibility of executing the
    law is mostly ceremonial, as it is the Federal Administration who do the day-to-day
    work. In this area, Presidents are seen as nothing more than a figurehead. The
    President will speak on behalf of the bureaucracy or the entire Federation government,
    with each cabinet member also filling the role of spokesperson for the respective
    policy department they head.\n\nThe second responsibility is unique in New Eden
    in the sense that a non-combatant is in ultimate control of one of New Eden\u2019s
    largest militaries, where other empire forces are in control of a senior military
    figure (such as an [Empress][Emperor Family](IXrotYvoWOVnuGAMbbYEv)) or are otherwise
    a faction unto themselves (such as the [Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN)).
    Civilian oversight of the military is seen as key to preventing wartime atrocities
    taking place that are contradictory to the values of a liberal democracy. It is
    the President\u2019s job to ensure that all branches of the Federation armed forces
    do not commit actions that would violate Gallente ideals, such as what occurred
    in the beginning of the [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV), while
    still being able to lead them effectively against forces that would threaten the
    safety and security of the union.\n\nThe third responsibility of the President
    is serving as the face of the Federation to foreign entities. Although the Senate
    has certain diplomatic powers, the President is most frequently called upon to
    act as first ambassador to other factions, having the power to propose treaties
    with foreign empires to be approved by the legislature. Presidents have acted
    on their own in this regard, or have been at the whims of a Senate alliance.\n\n#####
    Procedures\nFor the defense of the Federation from natural or man-made threats,
    the President heads the Federal Security Council. It is generally regarded as
    the highest and most powerful civilian body in the Federation despite no laws
    ever having identified it as such. The Security Council is made up of relevant
    cabinet officials, senior military officers, and chairpersons of relevant Senate
    committees. Representatives from member states either affected by or in need of
    military action are legally obliged to attend Security Council meetings and briefings
    (which can be open or closed door). Though the President has ultimate command
    of the military, they almost always deliberate with the Security Council, which
    can be dominated by specific personalities who are not the chief executive. This
    can result in very long responses to military flashpoints, far slower than the
    response times of other empires. For this reason, military commanders are trained
    to be able to act decisively and without executive support, while at the same
    time attempting to minimize any potential political fallout.\n\nOn the assumption
    that not all man-made threats can be dealt with in open channels, the [Federal
    Intelligence Office](4Q7sdriIYVeeQANNNXF0nH) is under the exclusive control of
    the President (albeit with some scrutiny from the Senate), giving the chief executive
    great powers beyond their more codified roles. The FIO is considered a controversial
    entity, sometimes seen as a private military force exclusively for executive interests.
    The other branches as well as the rest of the Federation merely tolerate the existence
    of the FIO as a necessary evil, trusting the President to act morally in protecting
    the union from the hidden threats within and without it. The FIO's foreign intelligence
    network is on par with the [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G), giving the President
    international sway.\n\nThe President has certain law-making powers. The President
    can pass Federal decisions known as executive orders, which pertain to particularly
    issues requiring central intervention. Presidents can also propose voluntary Federation-wide
    initiatives to member states. The President can propose legislation to the Senate,
    but takes no part in the deliberative process. All legislation proposed by the
    President goes to public vote by default, while Senate proposals can be forced
    to go to public vote by the executive. Senate bills can be vetoed by the President,
    on the assumption that the executive has either found the proposal to be unsuitable,
    or lacking in having gone through proper deliberation.\n\nHow freely a President
    utilizes their legislative power is heavily dependent on current traditions and
    their approval level. Presidents who are puppets of Senate alliances may be maneuvered
    to reflect the will of that faction. Only Presidents who are popular with the
    Federation public would dare to propose any legislation, as the outcome of the
    subsequent plebiscite will often reflect on their current popularity. The majority
    of Presidents have stuck to using their law-making powers only when it is absolutely
    necessary, although the more recent \u2018hands-on\u2019 chief executives such
    as Souro Foiritan and Jacus Roden have discarded these long-established traditions,
    at least temporarily.\n\n##### Reputation\nIn many respects, the [President](UW2GqozmvYnsm1kRPpp1E)
    can be considered the most powerful individual in New Eden. This is especially
    true when the President\u2019s role of being seniormost ambassador of a diplomatically,
    culturally, and economically influential empire is combined with their command
    of New Eden\u2019s second-largest armed force (which, in addition, has the greatest
    clusterwide presence), and their near-exclusive control over an extremely extensive
    interstellar intelligence network. As this mostly concerns perceptions of interstellar
    political and military power, the average citizen is unlikely to think a President
    to have any bearing over their everyday lives.\n\nOutside of their codified responsibilities,
    the President is generally accepted to have influence in setting the impetus and
    direction for the rest of the Federation government, either on behalf of a Senate
    alliance or as an independent figurehead. Often times, the President will appear
    as an actor or actress playing the role of the kind, considerate and generous
    mother or father of the people, dispute the harsh factionalism beneath the surface.\n"

  layout: default
- body: "#### Legislative\nThe Senate comprises the legislative arm of the Federation
    government. It currently holds 903 members, up from 881 a decade ago, with elections
    held every five years. Each Senator represents their district via a single sub-district
    where they are elected according to popular vote. A sub-district may take up a
    single solar system at its largest, or an individual planet at its smallest. The
    amount of sub-districts in a district depends on the size of the district\u2019s
    population. This means that not all districts have the same number of Senators
    representing them.\n\nA single Senator is internally elected to the position of
    Head of Senate, currently Aulmont Meis. The Head Senator acts as an arbitrator
    and facilitator of the legislature\u2019s proceedings, though some heads have
    functioned in a more executive role than traditions would typically allow.\n\nThe
    Senate itself is located in the Federation legislative and de facto capital of
    Villore, with auxiliary offices in Old Man Star. The flag of the Senate (which
    is also the flag of the whole Federation) is an eagle surrounded by twelve stars
    on a blue background. The stars originally acknowledged the twelve largest founding
    nations of the union, but has since moved on to represent principles taken from
    various Federation cultures. The blue is designed to stand for peace and cooperation.\n\n#####
    Responsibilities\nThe responsibilities of the Federation Senate are the following;\n\n-
    Legislation of new laws in the interests of both safeguarding and forwarding the
    principles of the Federation\u2019s founding treaties amongst its participants\n-
    Control of the Federal Budget in ensuring that all fiscal expenditure represents
    the will of the Federation and her participants\n- Oversight of the activities
    of other Federation institutions in the continuing efforts to enforce high moral
    standards and eradicate corruption in all its forms\n\nThe first responsibility
    of the Senate is the legislating of new laws in the interests of protecting or
    projecting the ideals laid out in the Federation Charter and Constitution. Any
    attempt to directly legislate for its constituent territories is seen as outright
    oppression of both the citizens and member states. As such, the Senate legislates
    within matters of interstellar affairs, which the Charter dictates as the central
    government\u2019s primary area of remit.\n\nThe second responsibility of the Senate
    is the supervision of taxation and fiscal spending via control of the Federal
    Budget. The legislature is entrusted with ensuring that the Federation\u2019s
    fiscal spending is in the best interests of the people. Control of the Federal
    Budget is exerted through monthly meetings and the passing of respective legislation.\n\nA
    third responsibility of the Senate is to ensure that the other branches of the
    Federation government are behaving as per the high moral standards of the union.
    The Federation\u2019s belief in multilateral dialogue means that one individual
    wrestling control of the entire government must be kept in check by a wider assembly
    of other individuals.\n\n##### Procedures\nAny Senator can propose a bill. Proposals
    go through several stages of reading as well as being forward to standing committees
    for review.. These committees and subcommittees thereof are composed of Senators
    with professional experience in a specific interstellar policy area, ranging from
    human security or economic development, to scientific affairs and social practices.
    Committees have significant sway over budgetary matters.\n\nDepending on the nature
    of the proposed law, the Senate will decide whether to vote internally or pass
    it to public referendum. The President, Head Senator, or Supreme Court can force
    any bill destined for Senate vote to become a public one instead. A simple majority
    is required for votes on most proposals, both amongst the Senate or public. Two-thirds
    majority is required for amendments or decisions (the latter of which is never
    voted on publically). Once a bill has become a full government act, it is signed
    into law by the President.\n\nFor the oversight of other areas of the government,
    the Senate maintains several standing committees that oversee and scrutinize the
    activities of the President and Federal Administration, as well as the military
    and intelligence communities. These committees monitor the budget for various
    government departments, and prepare legislation for appropriations to these areas.
    Committees are also maintained for oversight of the judiciary, particularly for
    advising the approval process of Supreme Court nominees.\n\nThe Senate also operates
    special select committees, which come into being in order to investigate particular
    occurrences and issues concerning either the Federal government or the Federation
    as a whole. Breaches of moral standard or government failings are two examples
    of select committee activities. Unlike standing committees, which are permanent,
    select committees expire once they have completed their primary duties.\n\nFinally,
    the Senate has the power to pass votes of no confidence on either the President
    and other Federal officials, or Supreme Court justices, requiring a two-thirds
    majority. The Senate is obliged to hold a vote of no confidence automatically
    if over half of all Senators receive a petition signed by a simple majority of
    all constituents in the sub-districts they represent.\n\n##### Reputation\nHistorically,
    Senators are considered the key interstellar political players in the Federation.
    Senators are widely considered one of the most (if not the most) educated and
    knowledgeable individuals in New Eden. Many will have at least two higher qualifications,
    with one in an astroscience of any discipline. Polymaths are highly-valued, and
    can expect an easy election into office.\n\nProspective Senators must demonstrate
    both their humanity and their education in equal parts if they are to be successful.
    They will near-universally have to represent hundreds or even thousands of smaller
    cultures and interests spread across multiple solar systems. Senators must be
    able to appeal to all of these groups without alienating any one of them, and
    rally them all together despite any differences and oppositions that exist between
    the groups.\n\nMost of a Senator\u2019s constituents will have little interest
    in Federal politics. Thus, how the Senator is able to exploit Federation representation
    for the benefit of their constituency is generally considered far more important
    than the Senator\u2019s contribution to a wider interstellar ideology.\n\n####
    Judicial\nThe Supreme Court comprises the judicial arm of the Federation government.
    The Supreme Court is composed of 13 justices including one seniormost chief justice
    (currently Broyal Alserette), all appointed for life by the President and approved
    by the Senate.\n\nThe Supreme Court itself is located in the Federation judicial
    capital of Parts, with auxiliary offices in Villore. The flag of the Supreme Court
    is an eagle carrying two swords crossed over one another on a red background and
    diagonal cross. The swords and diagonal cross is designed to represent the idea
    that the Federation will defend its principles, but never in anger. The red coloring
    is intended to stand for justice.\n\n##### Responsibilities\nThe responsibilities
    of the Federation Supreme Court are the following;\n\n- Interpretation of Federal
    Law for the efforts of upholding the values present in the Federation\u2019s founding
    treaties\n- Arbitration of disagreements between Federation participants in pursuit
    of an open, honest, and wholesome union\n- Protection of the law and all articles
    of the Federation's founding treaties from corrupting elements\n\nFor all of the
    above, the Supreme Court concerns itself with the higher truths of authority.
    It ensures that all elements of the Federation are just, and is known to adapt
    as the definitions of truth and justice change throughout the ages. The Federal
    Police (FedPol) fall under the judicial branch, and are trusted with protecting
    Federal Law in space. They are autonomous insofar that they do not answer to the
    Supreme Court, although their actions are kept in check by the Senate.\n\nThe
    role of Supreme Court is comparable to other judiciaries with interpretative duties
    in New Eden, like the Amarr\u2019s [Theology Council](38uUjWk3RiR80FqDwjmQWk).
    However, it differs from this example in the sense the Supreme Court very rarely
    deals with individual crimes, as Federal Law mostly concerns itself with the conduct
    of member states, megacorporations, and other interstellar bodies. The average
    citizen will never have any interaction with the Supreme Court, unless they come
    to the body after exhausting all lesser avenues of appeal.\n\n##### Procedures\nFor
    interacting with the other two branches of government, the Supreme Court has the
    power to overrule any action at a whim, be it Senate legislation or Presidential
    order, on the assumption these actions are not in the spirit of the laws and principles
    already established. Because justices are bound to neither popular support or
    political factions, they can act on their own moral codes that are (in theory)
    derived from the principles of the Federation\u2019s core documents. In practice,
    hundreds of lawyers employed by the Supreme Court monitor every aspect of how
    the Federation may be affected by a particular course of action, and attempt to
    offer their objective and holistic assessments to the justices. As a result, the
    Supreme Court only undermines the authority of the other two branches when it
    is deemed absolutely necessary.\n\nThe most common day-to-day activity of the
    Supreme Court is serving as an arbitrator of disputes between member states, ranging
    from territorial disagreements to the infringement of another\u2019s autonomy.
    Member states can also protest unwanted Federation government intervention to
    the Supreme Court, as well as corporations. As the Federation also has rights
    that have been handed over to it by signatory states, clashes between multiple
    parties can be common.\n\nThe Supreme Court can deal with individual citizens,
    generally from two groups. The first group are citizens who have come to the Supreme
    Court as the highest court of appeal, having exhausted all previous levels of
    justice. These are frequently individuals who feel their treatment by their original
    home governments is in violation of the Federal Constitution. The Supreme Court
    would carefully consider the rights of the individual according to the Constitution
    versus the rights of the member state according to the Charter, as well as any
    local cultural variables that come into play. Depending on the character of the
    justices involved, decisions can fall either way. The second group are tycoons
    and entrepreneurs (or otherwise rich citizens, such as celebrities) with interests
    spread across multiple planets, who have somehow managed to violate Federal Law,
    something that is a near-impossible feat for the average citizen.\n\nAs individual
    citizens, member state signatories, corporations, and the Federation itself all
    have rights and responsibilities granted unto them, excessively convoluted legal
    and political conflict is rife, especially when any one of these elements are
    in disagreement with one another. Though this does lead to criticisms of the Federation
    as inefficient and divisive, others support the above realities as key in ensuring
    that the freedom of the individual or group never means the freedom to oppress
    other individuals or groups.\n\n##### Reputation\nWhen it comes to the rare event
    of prosecuting individual citizens, the Supreme Court is not known for being fair
    when the subject in question is well-off. The odd citizen who does break Federal
    Law and is not wealthy will find themselves with a much harsher sentence than
    their rich counterparts. However, even if the rich can expect some leniency in
    sentences imposed by the Supreme Court they do not get preferential treatment
    in the investigation of a crime. A citizen is just as likely to be caught for
    a Federal crime whether at the top or bottom of the social ladder, given the fact
    it is a rare feat to begin with. Moreover, many consider that the social rejection
    by their peers is a much more efficient method of punishing the rich over wasting
    Federation money locking them up in a high-class prison.\n\nBecause Supreme Court
    justices are appointed for life to their position (with most starting judges already
    a century old), they generally do not concern themselves with the temporal nature
    of everyday Gallente politics or the differing ideologies that are constantly
    in flux. Instead, they focus purely on the greater ideals as outlined in the Federation\u2019s
    Constitution and Charter. This is a source of both support and criticism. Supporters
    of the Supreme Court state that the judiciary will never be bound to any interest
    other than the core of the Federation itself, which means the union will never
    stray from its ideals.\n\nCritics deride the judges of the Supreme Court as being
    disconnected from reality and too caught up in ideology. They are seen as unable
    to appreciate the cultural and social diversity of the Federation, as the universalistic
    nature of the Constitution and Charter does not always take into account the very
    complex and nuanced variations that crop up amongst the Gallente societies. However,
    in most cases regarding the above, it is not simply a matter of one approach or
    the other.\n\n#### Bureaucratic\nThe Federal Administration is the bureaucratic
    arm of the entire Federation government, although it technically falls under the
    executive branch. It is made up of millions of officers and employees, who are
    tasked with the day-to-day running of the union at the Federal and district level.
    The head offices of the bureaucracy are located in Algogille, with administrative
    operations across the Federation.\n\n##### Responsibilities\nThe responsibilities
    of the Federal Administration are the following;\n\n- Implementation of Federal
    Law across all Charter signatories\n- Collection of Federal taxes and tariffs
    from relevant participants\n- Supervision of the democratic process at the Federal
    and district level\n\nThe size and political fragmentation of the union means
    the [Federal Administration](3FvIDT7Y2mQEOOCLVpy3kz) maintains a space presence
    that is notably more active than its counterpart bureaucracies in other empires.
    This means that those living and working in space frequently interact with the
    Administration. At the planetary level, the Administration is aware of its unwelcome
    presence, and thus trusts the member states\u2019 own bureaucracies to carry out
    its duties in its stead.\n\n##### Procedures\nThe Federal Administration interacts
    primarily with member state and district governments for the implementation of
    the law. How the dialogue proceeds depends on the type of Federal law in question.
    The Administration mostly concerns itself either with the enforcement of a central
    decision or the monitoring of how well a member state is implementing a directive.
    In the latter case, the Administration can assist member states in drafting local
    legislation that complies with a Federal directive. The Administration takes an
    active role within member states that have opted for participation in an initiative.
    The bureaucracy may assist in the implementation of law on behalf of a district
    government, though never a member state, unless remit is explicitly granted by
    the local authority. In all cases, the Administration will employ various departments
    built around specific policy areas depending on the nature of the law being implemented.\n\nThe
    vast bulk of revenue collected by the Administration is from tariffs on space
    trade (which is proportionately much larger in the union than elsewhere), customs,
    and interstellar corporation tax. As space travel for ordinary citizens is much
    more accessible in the Federation than elsewhere, the Administration collects
    taxes from independent space captains and travel companies. All collected revenue
    goes directly to the Federal Budget. This means that the Federation government\u2019s
    finances relies heavily on the economic health and vibrancy of its spacelanes.
    The historically largest expenditures of the Federal Budget in no particular order
    include the armed forces, planetary aid and development (particularly in education
    and healthcare), administration and bureaucracy, industrial and economic cooperation,
    and space infrastructure (such as FTL communication relays and stargates). Funding
    in these areas varies according to the current makeup of the Senate and the immediate
    needs of the Federation.\n\nWhile the Federal Administration is responsible for
    collecting general taxation from the citizens, their weak presence on planets
    combined with corruption in very remote areas makes this an unreliable source
    of income. Only in well-integrated areas of the union (such as on [space stations](2qtjPWHmmUS1ochdVGMFx1))
    can citizens expect to pay Federal tax. This is a contentious and controversial
    issue with many different opinions on the matter. One opinion is that every single
    citizen of the union must pay tax as a matter of principle. Another opinion is
    that the Federation earns enough through other means, and that attempting to impose
    central authority by sending out tax collectors in droves may antagonize the member
    states and their respective citizens.\n\nFinally, the Federal Administration supervises
    all elections at the Federation and district level. These elections are publically
    funded, meaning the Administration has an active role in dealing with the thousands
    of political candidates who are campaigning for office. These exact procedures
    are detailed [here](50Q1BNUHpwZCZBn7VqBL18).\n\n##### Reputation\nAs bureaucratic
    power in the Federation ultimately rests with the member states, the Federal Administration
    does not have consistent levels of influence. While the Administration can be
    said to be ubiquitous along well-travelled spacelanes, its ability to operate
    at lower levels is kept in check by how willing a member state is in cooperating
    with the central government. As a result, administrative coverage and bureaucratic
    implementation is one of the weakest of the four empires, just ahead of the Minmatar
    Republic. Combined with the union's problematic integration issues, the existence
    of the Federal government is seen as irrelevant by many Gallente citizens, despite
    the Administration\u2019s best efforts.\n\n### Districts\nThe Federation is split
    into 62 districts. A district takes up a constellation, although particularly
    populous constellations are split into two districts. The purpose of a district
    is to offer some sense of political coherency by organizing the various member
    states of a constellation under a single body that the Federation can choose to
    interact with as an intermediary. Whether the member states permit a district
    to speak for them to the Federation varies.\n\nDistricts are also necessary for
    acting as a local authority in areas of Federation space which are not claimed
    by any member state or corporation. These are known as unorganized systems or
    territories. Any sense of a legal authority in these systems may not exist when
    district governments have little to no power.\n\n#### Parliaments\nEach Federation
    district is granted its own parliament. The official function of a district parliament
    is to consolidate representation of its various member states and respective citizens
    in order to advise and support the Senate on local issues. The political diversity
    of each member state necessitated the creation of districts, which offer a way
    of standardizing representation before the Federation without infringing on local
    political cultures.\n\nDistrict parliaments are bicameral. The lower chamber (known
    as the house) is composed of representatives elected by popular vote. One house
    member represents a single ward, which are the constituencies of a district. A
    ward is typically drawn according to the boundaries and population of a member
    state. The upper chamber (known as the council) is made up of councillors appointed
    by the district\u2019s member states, with one councillor to a single member state
    regardless of size.\n\nDistrict parliaments are funded by the member states. If
    member states pull out of funding a district parliament, the Federal Administration
    will do so instead. It is generally considered that the Federal Administration\u2019s
    funding for a district parliament is not adequate, meaning the parliament will
    only exist as a formality with little to no influence.\n\n##### Advisory role\nSenators
    of a district are required to hold weekly sessions with both chambers of the local
    parliament. From the lower chamber, the Senators will hear the issues and grievances
    of the district electorate, as well as report back whatever developments are taking
    place at the Federal level. The same dialogue will take place with the upper chamber,
    where the Senators will interact with the member state appointees. By tradition,
    the Senators of that district are expected to cooperate in taking the advice of
    the parliament to the Federation itself, but are ultimately under no obligation.
    Senators may choose to interact with constituents or member state governments
    directly, bypassing the district parliament altogether.\n\nDepending on the individual
    prestige of a Senator, they may be able to influence the proceedings of a district
    parliament. Alternatively, Senators may be at the whims of either one of the chambers
    (or both). If a district\u2019s citizens and/or member states do not support the
    Federation, they may manipulate their Senators to keep the central government
    at bay. If an opposing group of citizens and/or member states within that same
    district are supporters of the Federation, however, they may also use exploit
    Senator dialogue to this end.\n\n##### Law-making\nDistrict parliaments have the
    power to legislate laws for their jurisdiction. District parliaments do not have
    the power to propose legislation independently. Only the member states of a district
    can propose legislation to the parliament, either moved to by their respective
    government or citizenry. Both chambers of the parliament will then go through
    processes similar to the Federal Senate in order to reach a codecision. The bill
    will be exchanged between the chambers until a consensus is reached. If no codecision
    is made, the bill fails.\n\nNo chamber is superior to the other in this process.
    The intent of this rule is that member state sovereignty is not undermined by
    constellation-wide populism (as represented by the appointed upper chamber), yet
    the will of all people regardless of their background is not undermined by government
    oligarchy (as represented by the elected lower chamber). In reality, a district
    parliament may swing either way. If the people of a district are relatively united,
    then parliament authority can undermine that of the member states. If the member
    states are in league with one another, then individual representation is secondary.
    In the latter instance, a district will tend to legislate on intra-constellation
    economic affairs or other agreements pertaining to member state relations. Parliaments
    are weak or otherwise non-influential if there is no political cohesion within
    a constellation, especially if member states are in opposition to one another
    or are more interested in retaining authority for themselves. Power shifts frequently,
    and nothing is static in this regard.\n\nIn other cases, the law-making process
    can be dominated by a particularly powerful member state or bloc of. For example,
    the district parliament of the Luminaire home constellation has been historically
    at the whims of the Kingdom of Central Garoun (home to the famed city of Caille)
    as well as the Hueromont city-state. Likewise, the Intaki Assembly has majority
    influence in both chambers of their respective district parliament due to their
    large population, giving it de facto control over the wider constellation. The
    Jin-Mei\u2019s district parliament, meanwhile, exists as nothing but a formality;
    the Sang Do overlords have continued to hold nearly all the power in their nation.\n\n####
    Courts\nEach Federation district has its own court. Its primary purpose is to
    serve the role similar to that of the Supreme Court at a lower level, as the Federation
    is simply too big for one institution to manage single-handedly. For the interpretative
    role, the district courts ensure that any legislation or action passed by either
    the member states or district parliament are not in violation of any pre-established
    laws and protocols. However, unlike the Supreme Court, a district court is not
    meant to ensure that all legislation is derived from the Federal Charter, Constitution,
    or whatever local treaties are present. Rather, it ensures that local legislation
    is not in violation of, acting as an arbitrating go-to for the district's member
    states. This is because the district courts stand independently, and are not considered
    to be mechanistically tied to the district parliamentary or member state governments
    in the same way the Supreme Court is tied to the Federal Senate and President.\n\nDistrict
    courts also takes care of disputes or appeals from the member states and citizens
    on behalf of the Supreme Court. Because of the asymmetric nature of districts
    and the frequent non-cooperation of member states within them, some courts are
    impotent and inconsequential. Member states and their citizens will have to trust
    all parties in the assumption that no one is in violation of Federation law. The
    Supreme Court is available for instances of illegalities in this instances, but
    only once the relevant proceedings have gone through the local district court
    first.\n\n### Authorities\nThe legislative powers of the Federation government
    are known as authorities. Signatories of the Federal Charter retain all powers
    not explicitly delegated to the Federation itself. The Federation has sole authorities
    in some areas, where the member states are unable to act independently. In other
    areas, the member states are free to act, with Federation serving an assisting
    role should it be granted the remit to do so. The majority of authorities are
    joint, meaning that the member states may legislate only in areas where the Federation
    has not done so already.\n\nThe exception to the above is with signatories that
    have been granted the power of opt-out, who are permitted to legislate within
    those areas that are typically reserved for the Federation government.\n\n####Sole
    authorities\nThe Federation has sole authority to legislate within:\n\n- Human
    security and defense\n- Interstellar customs\n- Extraterritorial diplomatic policy\n-
    Construction and maintenance of military stargates\n- FTL communications\n- Establishment
    of competition rules necessary for the functioning of the Federal interstellar
    market\n- Monetary policy for member states with Federal currency\n- Interstellar
    travel and starship licensing\n- Extraterritorial colonial administration\n- Territorial
    cohesion\n- Conservation of natural planetary environments under [the Aclan Agreement](239UsWf0eflceZoW5SLYvE)
    and other treaties\n- Conservation of mineral resources under Federal astromining
    policies\n\n#### Joint authorities\nMember states are free to legislate in the
    following areas where the Federation has not done so prior:\n\n- The Federal interstellar
    market\n- Construction and maintenance of civilian stargates\n- Trade and commercial
    policy\n- Corporate regulation\n- Consumer protection\n- Interplanetary infrastructure
    and transport\n- Planetary ownership\n- Economic cohesion\n- GalNet regulation\n-
    Energy production\n- Freedom, security, and justice\n- Social policy for aspects
    defined by the Federal Constitution\n- Health and safety policy for aspects defined
    by the Federal Constitution\n\nFederation exercise in authority does not prevent
    member states from exercising theirs in:\n\n- Space colonization and development\n-
    Planetary colonization and development\n- Research and technological development\n-
    General development cooperation\n- Financial aid\n\n#### Assisting authorities\nIf
    remit is granted, the Federation can support, coordinate, or supplement member
    states action in:\n\n- Law enforcement, anti-piracy, and counter-terrorism/-insurgency\n-
    Protection and improvement of human health\n- Civil protection and disaster prevention\n-
    Social and political cohesion\n- Industry\n- Culture\n- Tourism\n- Education and
    vocational training\n- Administrative assistance\n\nThe occasional ambiguity of
    the above when applying it to specific cases means that member states frequently
    battle with the Federation (and vice versa) as to what areas of legislative authority
    are reserved for them. While the Supreme Court keeps an eye on these situations,
    it is careful to only intervene as a last resort. This results in very long legal
    clashes and media frenzies, though a compromise is almost always reached once
    fatigue sets in.\n\n### Laws\nThe laws of the Federation government (Federal Law)
    take supremacy over those made by member states. It is divided into primary and
    secondary legislation. Primary Federal Law is composed of the articles of the
    Charter and the Constitution, and forms the basis for all Federation government
    action. It is altered by the use of amendments. Secondary Federal Law includes
    regulations, directives, resolutions and decisions. They are derived from the
    principles and objectives set out in the Charter and Constitution.\n\n#### Amendments\nAn
    amendment is legislation passed that alters any articles present in the Federation
    Charter or Constitution. Amendments can be proposed by the President or Senate,
    and must have the approval of two-thirds of all district parliaments. Once this
    has happened, all amendments are required to be voted on publically via Federation-wide
    referendum.\n\nAmendments are proposed when elements of the Federation\u2019s
    core structure and/or ideologue are perceived to have become outdated. The last
    Federal amendment to be passed was increasing the Federation President\u2019s
    term limit from one to two.\n\n#### Regulations\nA regulation is immediately enforceable
    and self-executing as law in all member states simultaneously, and does not require
    any implementing measures. They are passed only by the Senate. The vast majority
    of regulations concern the political and economic conduct of Federation member
    states, such as within the areas of interstellar trade and travel, as well as
    communication. Very few regulations dictate the conduct of individuals, as this
    is not considered as something within Federation remit. Regulations concerning
    individual citizens mostly cover crimes against Federal officers, or space crimes
    such as piracy or interstellar trafficking.\n\nRegulations are typically implemented
    when a new technology or trend (or any sort of development in particular), if
    left unchecked, would threaten to violate the articles outlined in the Constitution
    and Charter.\n\n#### Directives\nA directive requires member states to achieve
    a particular result without the Federation dictating the means of achieving that
    result. They are passed only by the Senate. Directives leave member states a significant
    amount of freedom as to how they will adopt the exact law. Typically, a member
    state will pass its own local law that fits the criteria of the Federal directive.\n\nDirectives
    are the most common type of laws legislated by the Federation, as they are seen
    as not infringing on the rights of its members while still pursuing a common good
    through cooperation. The majority of directives concern matters such as the implementing
    of a new technology across the Federation, or adjusting industrial policy in the
    face of changes in New Eden\u2019s interstellar economy.\n\nOther directives may
    concern living or working standards. Regulations are not used in such instances,
    as the Federation is often aware of the complex nuances at the local level which
    prevent blanket laws from being effective. Typically, directives are used in the
    pursuit of a new ideal, whereas regulations are implemented to prevent already
    established ideals from being broken.\n\n#### Resolutions\nResolutions are legislative
    acts that are non-binding, and can only be passed by the Senate. They are designed
    to function as a symbolic gesture, taking a libertarian approach in encouraging
    the individual member states to carry forward the principles of the resolution
    themselves on a voluntary basis, without central involvement. Resolutions are
    traditionally passed regarding issues that may require decisive action, but where
    direct intervention by the Federation government would do more harm than good.
    Member states who do not abide by a resolution may be punished by other member
    states, but only through legal means (mostly economic sanction). Citizens who
    feel their member state governments should be following a resolution are by tradition
    expected to utilize the local democratic process in carrying this forward.\n\nResolutions
    can be very common, passed as frequently as directives. Their popularity is derived
    from a resolution's libertarian nature, which gives member states a significant
    amount of freedom within the system in being able to decide whether or not participation
    will benefit them. Incentives, be it respect or capital, may encourage participation
    in a resolution.\n\nResolutions may be decided on by public vote. Since the outbreak
    of the Empyrean War, the number of resolutions passed has dropped somewhat, especially
    in areas affected by the conflict. \n\n#### Decisions\nDecisions only apply to
    particular issues, and can be passed by any three of the Federation\u2019s government
    branches. Decisions are never subject to public vote.\n\n##### Instructions\nBills
    passed by the Senate as decisions are known as instructions, and fall within two
    areas. The first type of instruction may concern itself with a specific issue
    or flashpoint that emerges within the Federation and cannot be resolved by member
    state authorities, such as a planetary disaster or political conflict. The second
    type of instruction concerns areas directly pertaining to the Federation as a
    central entity. This includes matters such as foreign, defense, and budgetary
    matters. The majority of decisions fall under this latter category.\n\n##### Rulings\nMany
    decisions are passed by the Supreme Court, where they are known as rulings. Supreme
    Court rulings are typically made when a member state or individual is found violating
    Constitution or Charter Law. The Supreme Court has the power to penalize or sanction
    member states who are in Federal violation. After making a decision, their ruling
    becomes applicable for the indefinite future as Federal Law.\n\n##### Orders\nIf
    a decision is passed by the President, it is known as an order or executive order,
    typically suffixed with a five-digit number. Typically, executive orders are either
    concerned with very small issues that are of no real concern to the wider Federation,
    such as prisoner bureaucracy, or come in response to a major flashpoint that requires
    immediate action by the central government or military. The latter is extremely
    risky to the popularity of a President, as the wrong decision could be perceived
    as a single individual trying to wrestle his or her tyrannical influence over
    the Federation, or otherwise undermining citizen or member freedoms.\n\nThe last
    decision made by a President was Executive Order 81402, or better known as the
    Hueromont Act, which was a failed attempt by Souro Foiritan to nationalize the
    arms industry in the wake of Caldari military victories. This gross miscalculation
    on his part effectively ended his Presidency.\n\n#### Initiatives\nInitiatives
    are not technically laws, but nonetheless fall within the Federation\u2019s legislative
    remit. The Senate or President can propose an initiative to Federation member
    states, who have the option of accepting or refusing participation. Members who
    choose to participate in an initiative must abide by the protocols dictated by
    the Federation, on the agreement that it will benefit their territories once the
    initiative is implemented.\n\nInitiatives primarily concern education, healthcare,
    the development of infrastructure, and other social or economic matters. Often
    times, initiatives are criticized as the Federation exploiting gullibility of
    its member states at the expense of the latter\u2019s freedoms, only for the former
    to leverage influence over local autonomy.\n\nAn example was with the Protein
    Delicacies fiasco, which was a Federation initiative to supply the artificial
    food product across all Gallente schools, unaware that the food actually stunted
    mental growth. Though many attribute the act to the Caldari, others felt that
    the incident demonstrated how the Federation should not involve itself in relatively
    mundane affairs such as school catering.\n\n#### Petitions\nBy law, a petition
    that is presented before the Federation government with a backing of a certain
    number of citizens is required to become a formal topic within the Senate. Petitions
    can be written to either the President or a Senator. A petition that originates
    from two or more districts requires at least one billion supporters for the document
    to become a formal issue. A petition from a single district requires 51% of the
    local constituents for the document to become a formal issue.\n\nPetitions typically
    concern a specific social or technological development that the Federation government
    may not be aware of. As the Federation's primary remit is to pass wide-sweeping
    laws rather than concern itself with minute details, petitions are taken very
    seriously, as they demonstrate that the government's hands-off methods is not
    being as effective as it should be. Thus, a petition will almost always become
    law in one of the four previous forms, although how much they address absolutely
    all grievances may vary.\n\n### Participation\nAll of the above is considered
    empty and meaningless without [democratic participation](50Q1BNUHpwZCZBn7VqBL18)
    by the citizenry. Voting by universal suffrage is the official exercise of a citizen's
    political power, whether this is via a general election or a legal referendum.
    Third parties constitute the civil society, a key role in a democracy that bridges
    the gap between the government and the people. These civil society groups may
    include activist blocs, charities, and many other non-governmental organizations.
    Technology also plays a key role, either being informed of the effects of government
    actions by independent news providers or discussing politics with fellow citizens
    over GalNet and FTL. There are many vehicles and mediums of democracy in the Federation,
    and may very well be limitless as new forms of political participation are discovered
    every day.\n\nThe participation of citizens regardless of background or standing
    is to ensure that the Federation's governments are prevented from unnecessarily
    interfering with the lives of individuals. The reality of the matter is that too
    much or too little popular participation can turn a democracy into either a tyranny
    of the majority or an oligarchy of the minority. Though a rare occurrence (and
    extremely short-lived at the Federal level at least, however damaging), the justice
    system and civil society remains ever watchful for such instances, but the vast
    size of the union combined with its state of constantly being in flux means that
    the battle to destroy government oppression in all its forms is a constant one.\n"
