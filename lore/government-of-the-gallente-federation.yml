- body: "The **Gallente Federation is a treaty-based interstellar community** of semi-independent
    and autonomous nations, planets and solar systems, based on a democratic and libertarian
    system. Officially the Federated Union of Gallente Prime, [Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK)
    government itself functions as a supranational authority that promotes and protects
    individual rights, free economies, and democratic governance across the stars.
    As a [democracy](50Q1BNUHpwZCZBn7VqBL18), it is unique in the sense that ultimate
    power rests with the Federation\u2019s peoples, who actively participate in the
    political process. Its existence as a pluralistic union of nations has created
    a level of social, cultural, and political diversity unseen anywhere else in [New
    Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk).\n\n\n###History\nThe Gallente\u2019s habit for
    progressive government and constant reform has resulted in the different eras
    of Federation politics being grouped by academics into so-called \u2018Unions\u2019.\n\n\n####First
    Union\nThe First Union is synonymous with the founding of the Gallente Federation
    in 23121AD. The union was designed to cultivate interplanetary trade and space
    development as the sole representative body of humanity, created as a replacement
    of the various diplomatic agreements that had existed for several centuries prior.
    The founding members were the nations of the Gallente, [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy),
    [Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn), and [Mannar](4BaMCkOwYaPpd4ZMtEfEY) homeworlds,
    signing the treaty known as the Federal Charter. Other members would join over
    time (such as the [Achura](4zhtMkBDe0W8xX2ihsfnik)), but would lack the size or
    influence of the founding races.\n\nThis incarnation of the Federation was very
    loose in structure, acting as a supraplanetary colonial alliance that was mostly
    concerned with interstellar economic affairs and trade, though it would operate
    a  as a peacekeeping armada. Post-nationalism and post-racialism were two of its
    founding principles, and thus the Federation did not regard itself as a nation
    in the traditional sense (given contact with the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
    had yet to be established). At this time, the government was composed only of
    a [Senate](x8brOPuT22Bcly2Sikkt5), with representatives appointed by the Federation\u2019s
    member governments. Internally, Senators would elect a [President](UW2GqozmvYnsm1kRPpp1E)
    from their ranks, who would be able to exhibit some executive powers.\n\n\n####Second
    Union\nThe Second Union came about not long after the invention of [Faster Than
    Light Communication](7Eqc0yOgUoUswOop0Q2uMQ) in 23146AD. The establishment of
    FTL relays across the Federation allowed popular democracy to take place at an
    interstellar level, which was previously considered a logistical impossibility.
    Eventually, the Federal Charter was amended so that voting by universal suffrage
    would elect one-third of the members of the Federation Senate, rising to half
    within the following years.\n\nThe creation of a Luminaire-dominated interstellar
    media network would cultivate the notion of \u2018human rights\u2019 across the
    member planets of the Federation. Member nations would often bypass the Federal
    government to sanction or penalize \u2018unsavory\u2019 states directly, as the
    Federation had no legal basis to intervene in planetary affairs. As this proved
    disharmonious, a Constitution was eventually created that would outline and protect
    the rights for every single citizen. The Federal Charter was amended to recognize
    the treaty to be binding across all member nations.\n\nMany academics consider
    the Second Union to be the first step to the Federation taking on the concept
    of traditional nationhood, something that was previously considered outdated and
    anachronistic by many. The Constitution\u2019s use of the term \u2018Federation
    citizen\u2019 for the first time pointed to this notion.\n\n\n####Third Union\nAfter
    the departure of the Caldari from Luminaire in 23156AD following the outbreak
    of the [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV), the Federation underwent
    a series of reforms to prevent a further political calamity from occurring a second
    time. In order to avoid future divisions, a standardized system of democracy implemented
    at the interstellar level would be see as one of the means to this ideal, deemphasizing
    the focus on nations using the Federation as a forum to compete against one another.\n\nThe
    Third Union created the modern day three pillar system, composed of an executive,
    legislative, and judicial branches. Each would have clear separation of powers
    to prevent totalitarian forces from wrestling control of the government. Rather
    than being elected from the Senate, the President would occupy a separate executive
    branch, as the nominal head of the newly-established [Federal Administration](3FvIDT7Y2mQEOOCLVpy3kz).
    Every Federation citizen past the age of suffrage would be entitled to vote for
    the President every five years. The Senate would occupy the legislative branch,
    now fully elected (again every five years) rather than half of the chamber being
    appointed by member nations. Finally, the judicial branch was composed of a [Supreme
    Court](6gOOivEzFVq2cUAKDvKZEQ), which would protect and uphold the Federation
    Charter and Constitution.\n\nDistricts were also created as a product of the Third
    Union, in response to protests from colonies of the Federation member nations
    that did not have representation in the Senate. Member nations were no longer
    permitted to operate colonies outside of their home constellation, effectively
    granting these vassal territories full independence from their motherlands. Instead,
    newly-created districts (each taking up a constellation for the most part) would
    be granted its own parliament and court for the member states to consolidate under.
    Member states could use these Federation-recognized districts to deal with local
    issues and advise the Senate as a collective entity.\n\nRather than representing
    their home countries, Senators would now represent districts instead. It was to
    be emphasized that politicians at the Federation level were to be representatives
    of the people regardless of member state. Signatory nations would now use their
    district parliaments rather than the Federation as localized interstellar forums.\n\nFurther
    appeasement came with the granting of certain member states the power of \u2018opt-out\u2019,
    which allowed territories to refuse to take part in elements of the Federation\u2019s
    laws. Some considered this to be a knee-jerk and paranoid response to possible
    union instabilities, even unjust as citizens from opted-out territories could
    still vote in Federation elections yet not be subject to all its laws. Member
    nations in the Luminaire and Intaki solar systems would have the most opt-outs.
    The [Jin-Mei](6SFvK45QIlCCCoNODY3gUB) nation would be granted opt-outs to protect
    its caste system when it joined the Federation in 23174AD.\n\n\n####Fourth Union\nThe
    Fourth Union emerged following the social, cultural, and political shocks of encountering
    the Amarr Empire in 23180AD. No longer the sole interstellar civilization of humanity
    in known space, doubts were raised amongst its members, considering the possibility
    that subscribing to democracy was not a compulsory requirement for ascending into
    the stars. Reforms would be undertaken to maintain unity in the face of the Amarr.\n\nA
    movement emerged, concerned with reviving the once-discarded concepts of nationhood
    to implement across the entire Federation. Portions of this movement emphasized
    the Federation as a \u201Cnation of nations\u201D (rather than just an alliance),
    while other segments focused more on individuals. Federal citizens came to regard
    the Empire as a corrupt, oppressive tyranny eager to stamp out other cultures,
    and that only through [slavery](slavery) and heavy-handedness had it emerged so
    large. In some circles, the Federation would still be seen as the only representative
    of human civilization, with the Amarr Empire deemed as enemies of mankind altogether.\n\nThrough
    this movement, the Senate passed a series of laws in order to appear as a more
    cohesive entity before the Amarr Empire. A system of general taxation would be
    introduced (prior to this, founder nation funding and trade tariffs were the primary
    sources of Federal revenue). Though the introduction of taxation was immensely
    unpopular at first, member state funding was abolished, resulting in lowered local
    taxes. This meant that the average citizen would pay no more than they usually
    would, ultimately quelling protests. Trade tariffs were lowered, stimulating further
    trade between Federation members.\n\nThe new laws would generally limit and curb
    the spacefaring powers of planetary nations somewhat, with the exclusion of those
    in the home systems. Member state militaries no longer being able to operate beyond
    their respective nation\u2019s boundaries was one notable law. Smaller protocols
    were introduced, such as starship licenses granted by planetside bodies no longer
    being recognized, only documentation given to space captains by the Federation.
    To enforce the new laws and protocols, an interstellar gendarmerie known as the
    Federal Police was created, taking the best of the best from local planetary and
    system law enforcement agencies. FedPol (alternatively the more colloquial \u2018Gallente
    Police Department\u2019, or GPD) fell under the judicial branch, becoming the
    enforcer of the new \u2018Federal Law\u2019 that was emerging.\n\n\n####Fifth
    Union\nThe Fifth Union started with the founding of CONCORD in 23233AD, and became
    further realized after peace was signed with the Caldari in YC12. The creation
    of an international system where the Federation was just one of five major nations
    saw the union take a different approach to decades prior, focusing more on internal
    affairs rather than stellar expansion.\n\nAs territorial expansion of the major
    factions had effectively halted in the wake of CONCORD\u2019s founding, the Federation
    looked to developing large tracts of its space that had been ignored up until
    this point. Eventually, the groundwork for a welfare program would be laid out,
    where the Federation government would start handing out financial aid to planetary
    governments or individuals to assist in local development or alleviate poverty.
    The end of the war and the subsequent slashing of the military budget gave the
    Federal government plenty of capital to invest in development projects across
    its territories, and generally work to improve quality of living for the first
    time.\n\nSuccessors of President [Aidonis Elabon](3IcoxAofkzoA9VQJbk5mPE) failed
    to live up to the high standard that he had set. Presidents in this era became
    puppets of the various political alliances working behind the scenes, and while
    most acted independently, they always did so within the strict framework set by
    these groups. As a result, they became perceived as weaklings who could not think
    or act for themselves, frequently brow-beaten by the Senate. Instead, it was the
    Senate that began to see itself as the true leader of the Federation.\n\nThe atomization
    of Federal politics between hundreds of Senators resulted in lobbyist factions
    pushing through the use of electronic referenda to utilize public opinion, believing
    in a more open democracy for all. However, the negligible interaction an everyday
    citizen has with the Federation combined with the fact the central government
    primarily legislates on spaceside affairs would result in extremely low turnouts
    for these referenda, averaging around 10% each time.\n\nThe Fifth Union\u2019s
    focus on social and planetary development would see a political alliance called
    the Social Democrats (or Sociocrats) emerge as the main political force in the
    Federation for that time. The Sociocrats advocate social equality on all levels,
    believing that the Federal government\u2019s highest priority is to aid underdeveloped
    member worlds and those in the lower stratas of the Gallente societies. This came
    at the cost of planetary autonomy and the more laissez-faire approaches of the
    Federation. Towards the end of the Fifth Union, the welfare system would break
    down when supporting it became uneconomical, especially when corrupt planetary
    governments would hoard the aid for themselves rather than distribute it to their
    constituents. Over time, the more individualistic-focused Progressors would become
    the largest alliance, slightly ahead of the Sociocrats.\n\n\n####Sixth Union\nThe
    Sixth Union began with the election of President Souro Foiritan in YC103. The
    era would be characterized by the rise of big personalities amongst the Federal
    government and the significant increase of member autonomy previously curbed under
    the Sociocrats. It also saw the creation of the constitutionally questionable
    [Black Eagles](6eVk3icIk4UHf5Uh799xDN).\n\nAlthough President Souro Foiritan was
    elected as a Progressor in YC103, his first action was to expel his main competitors
    from the alliance, and subsequently distance himself from the faction in following
    years. The President did not intend to be a puppet of the alliances, and proceeded
    to overturn the popular perception that the Senate were the true leaders of the
    Federation by using his charisma and shrewd intelligence. Not since Aidonis Elabon
    a century ago had a big personality arisen in Gallente politics, causing Souro
    Foiritan to be one of the most popular Presidents in Federation history.\n\nTo
    counterbalance President Foiritan\u2019s charisma, Head Senator Mentas Blaque
    would rise as his main rival. The Senate as a whole, in order to compete and contrast
    with Foiritan\u2019s populism, became a champion of megacorporate and entrenched
    interests for its main source of support. This would turn Federation politics
    into a spectacle of competing personalities and ideologies. However, the massive
    increases of member and citizen autonomy under President Foiritan meant that such
    trends on the Federal stage would rarely affect the average citizen. The Supreme
    Court, as the impartial arbiter of the Federation, would regularly intervene to
    prevent the spectacle from threatening the core principles of the union.\n\nOne
    major constitutional change pushed through by Souro Foiritan was that Presidents
    can now be elected for a maximum of two terms. It was widely considered that a
    single five-year term rule was an outdated concept in the contemporary era, and
    was simply not long enough for a President to have any lasting effects on the
    massive bureaucracy the Federation had become.\n\nPresident Jacus Roden, elected
    in YC111, would be another so-called big personality President, though he is considered
    much more of a pragmatist than a populist. He would continue the trend of the
    previous administration to increase citizen and member autonomy, while using the
    Black Eagles to defactionalize the Federal government and serve as an intervention
    force. The spectacle that had defined Federation politics in previous years has
    been subsiding through Roden\u2019s policy of tightening control of the executive
    and legislative branches, castrating the power of alliances\nand politically eliminating
    any other potential \u2018big personalities\u2019.\n\nJacus Roden\u2019s extensive
    knowledge of Federal Law means that the President has been able to work his way
    around the system to avoid the Supreme Court intervening to declare his methods
    as illegal or unlawful. Indeed, one of President Roden\u2019s key policies is
    to unite the three branches by eradicating the self-aggrandizing politics of the
    previous administration. Many critics point out that it is an irony that the Federation
    could only remain solvent in the face of record levels of freedom and autonomy
    (almost equal and in some parts exceeding First Union standards) thanks to the
    existence of the Black Eagles, who seem ever ready to remove destabilizing elements
    who would exploit their newfound liberties.\n\n\n###Treaties\nThe core of the
    Federation is its Charter, and its Constitution to a slightly lesser extent. Unlike
    other empires, power in the Federation ascends from the bottom, rather than being
    dictated top down. Thus, if all signatories withdrew from the Charter, then the
    Federation would cease to exist, at least in theory. On the other hand, as the
    Constitution identifies individuals existing as citizens of the Federation independent
    of its member states, the solvency of the union is a unique question amongst academics.\n\n\n####Federation
    Charter\nThe Federation Charter is the founding document of the union. It stipulates
    the creation of an interstellar alliance of nations, planets and colonies for
    three main purposes;\n\n- Regulation of free and fair trade between its signatories\n-
    Facilitation of peaceful stellar expansion for its signatories\n- Promotion of
    democratic governance amongst its signatories\n\nThe Charter outlines the powers
    and limitations of the Federation government, the rights of each member state,
    and the expectations of each signatory. There are three core requirements of joining
    the Federation, outlined by the Charter. The first is that the economy of a member
    state must not be closed to free trade with other signatories. The second is that
    the government of a member state must be democratic, with regular elections and
    universal suffrage. The third requirement was added later with the introduction
    of a Constitution, stipulating that the society of a member state must respect
    and abide by the latter document\u2019s articles.\n\nOutside of these three core
    requirements, a member state is free to govern itself as it wishes, although Federal
    Law takes supremacy over local politics. This has given the territories of the
    Federation an unrivalled level of political diversity, to the point that the trappings
    of a government in Placid would be completely different to its counterpart in
    [Solitude](mQjw4DzdzeHF8rNpzaZKr).\n\nThe benefits of Charter membership are many,
    though the two considered the most desirable is the opportunity to compete economically
    and the ability to exploit Federal representation for local benefit. Military
    and diplomatic protection is another major benefit for signatories less concerned
    with central participation.\n\n\n####Federation Constitution\nThe Constitution
    of the Federation was created some years after the invention of FTL communications.
    Although not a founding document, it is nonetheless binding for all member states
    and citizens to abide by. It stipulates that the Federation be founded on a system
    of semi-direct democracy, and on the values of equality, justice and freedom.
    The document is designed to be politically neutral and a human universal, independent
    of culture and history (though plenty do not deny it is simply an extension of
    ideas taken from [Gallente Prime](41JbD6M3Keq024T44ULv7a))\n\nThe Constitution
    has titles in the following order;\n\n- **Dignity**: Human dignity is inviolable.
    Articles primarily concern the physical and mental integrity of the individual,
    and the outlawing of slavery.\n- **Freedom**: Right to liberty. Includes right
    of (such as thought, identity, and religion), right to (such as education, privacy,
    and expression), and right from (such as persecution, censorship, and expulsion).
    Also covers the right to self-determination, notably including articles on territorial
    freedoms.\n- **Equality**: Everyone is equal before the law. Enforces non-discrimination
    and respects cultural, religious, and linguistic diversity.\n- **Justice**: Fairness
    and impartiality in the justice systems. Concerns the right to a free trial, the
    presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and that penalties must be proportionate
    to the offences committed.\n- **Solidarity**: Freedoms of citizens within larger
    social structures. Protects the rights of workers, consumers, and families. Entitles
    citizens to social assistance and healthcare. Enforces environmental protection
    in the interests of social comfort.\n- **Citizenship**: Right to political participation.
    Articles regarding the right to vote and stand as a political candidate, the right
    to good governance, the right to petition, and the freedom of movement and residence.\n\nThe
    Constitution also has a seventh title regarding the interpretation and application
    of the document. The Gallente, when proposing the creation of a constitution and
    having centuries worth of experience in democracy themselves, were fully aware
    of the issues with how such a document can be twisted for personal agendas. Because
    each citizen and politician interprets liberty in their own way, the Constitution
    is careful to ensure that the individual freedoms given by the Federation do not
    involve the freedom to oppress other individuals, which is a constant political
    and legal issue in the union. Articles in this section ensure that the constitutional
    freedoms cannot be abused, nor can they be disproportionately taken out of scope
    or context.\n\nThe existence of such a constitution is unique across the four
    empires. Its emphasis on the rights of the individual over the rights of governments
    is what attracts millions of immigrants to the Federation each year. Indeed, those
    who have spent any significant amount of time in the Federation (or outside of
    it) often reportedly begin to feel that the levels of freedoms provided by the
    Constitution makes the other empires appear irredeemably oppressive and totalitarian.\n\n\n###Members\nThe
    Federation is composed of tens of thousands of member states that are organized
    into 62 constellation-sized districts. Colonies, an important building block of
    the contemporary Federation, slot into this structure with their own set of liberties
    and laws. In addition to these two types of member territories, there are also
    special city-states called registered megalopoli, and territories that are under
    direct Federal control (known as FCTs). The member state is the first point of
    interaction and identification for the vast majority of citizens, with the Federation
    government having secondary or tertiary relevance at best, if one at all. \n\nThe
    member states are libertarian in nature, meaning they are expected to take full
    responsibility for all their own affairs, and are assumed to conduct themselves
    in a way that abides by and is not in direct violation of any interstellar protocols.
    The central Federation authority and other bodies are available to assist a member
    state in fulfilling these responsibilities (but only when remit is granted), or
    punish should they fail to live up to the standard. Outside of following democratic
    principles, the member states are proscribed no method of self-governance. While
    this has given member states a very large amount of freedom and diversity, it
    equally results in widespread divisiveness due to the political relativism present
    in the system. This has created a paradox where a member state's pursuit of freedom
    and security may undermine another's, or even the wider whole.\n\n\n####Signatories\nThe
    member signatories of the Federation compose the fundamental administrative makeup
    of the union. They are smaller nations that have agreed to abide by the laws and
    principles of the Charter and Constitution in exchange for the political, economic,
    and military benefits of Federation membership. In many ways, each member nation
    can be considered sovereign or independent insofar as its level of self-governance,
    although neither CONCORD nor the other empires recognize the constituent nations
    of the Federation to be independent. This comes despite the fact that member states
    can be extremely distinct from one another, having their own language, culture,
    and customs.\n\n\n#####Territorial\nFederation member signatories vary in size.
    There is generally a preference towards higher levels of territorial fragmentation
    in the Federation, as larger authorities suffer a negative stigma for being seen
    as homogenizing and bureaucratically cumbersome (thus perceived as authoritarian).\n\nIn
    relatively newer areas of the Federation, member nations are found as entire solar
    systems. This may involve a single planet that claims authority to the whole system
    and all colonies within it, to smaller nations that come together to form a single
    solar union. The smallest nations are found as individual territories on planets,
    from island-states to continental confederations. This is common in areas settled
    before the Federation\u2019s founding, particularly on homeworlds such as Gallente
    Prime, Caldari Prime, and Intaki. These historical legacy states were founded
    centuries before the Federation, or even centuries before spaceflight in the case
    of a homeworld. They are not just found on the major homeworlds, and can be found
    as minor civilizations as well. \n\nOther types of planetary nations are territories
    that declared their independence from a larger government (a practice which is
    mostly bloodless and protected by the Federal Charter). In many cases, worlds
    colonized by a single state can proceed to fragment into multiple territories
    once the planet has been settled and/or developed in full. If large enough, certain
    artificial habitats (in space or otherwise) can be categorized as member signatories.\n\n\n#####Political\nA
    Federation member state's government and political format must be democratic in
    some form or another. So long as a system abides by certain rules (eg. universal
    suffrage and regular elections), any type of government imaginable is permitted
    in the system. This gives member states the freedom to construct a government
    that reflects their indigenous culture. Ancient areas of Gallente Prime (or neo-classical
    Gallente nations elsewhere) can be constitutional or elective monarchies. Recently
    elevated civilizations can use a tribal parliamentary system. Future-minded communities
    may experiment with a digital form of government.\n\nTrends indicate that the
    level of technology available to a member nation influences its execution of democracy.
    Advanced countries may use direct democracy or variations thereof (such as demarchy
    or consensus), while countries that aren\u2019t as developed rely on representative
    forms of democracy. The level of education plays a similar role, with better-educated
    societies showing greater inclination to direct democracy. Either way, all are
    built on the assumption that each system is ultimately accountable to the people.\n\n\n#####Diplomatic\nMember
    states reserve the right to engage in diplomatic agreements with other members
    as well as the Federation itself. Travel and trade agreements are the most common,
    and there is generally little limitation on how member states can interact. Member
    states reserve the right to refuse any sort of outside presence in their borders,
    and are under no obligation to cooperate with one another or the central government
    whatsoever (assuming there is no breach of Federation treaties). A [franchise
    system](7nwbW8LIvwRIDCFoi2E6vX) is used by member states to delegate out various
    responsibilities to outside bodies regarding the economic activities of their
    wider solar system, as it is generally considered that member states are too weak
    to engage in interstellar development on their own.\n\nEven if member states have
    the power to theoretically defy central authorities outright, doing so can potentially
    sour relations with other signatories. Cooperation is encouraged in the name of
    promoting interstellar harmony. By tradition, it is assumed that if a member state
    is not interested in cooperating with their neighbors, then they would have not
    signed the Charter in the first place. The agreement to this collective goal is
    one element that keeps the Federation relatively cohesive. Isolationism is more
    than tolerated, so long as that member state does not attempt to impose itself
    on others.\n\nThough most member states have their own armed forces, they are
    restricted from sending them beyond their designated territories unless they are
    a participant of the Federation Army. For interstellar defense, member states
    delegate out the Federation Navy or other reputable outfit. This does not come
    from any legal obligation, but more as a practice of tradition and habit.\n\n\n#####Economic\nMember
    states rely heavily on trade with one another for their economic affairs. All
    member states must be open to free and fair trade. A member state may specialize
    in one product to export, or rely completely on imports. Generally, there is a
    complex weave of economic interdependency across the member states, and it has
    been said numerous times that it is this particular reality that has kept the
    union cohesive in the face of the massive social and political divisions that
    characterize the Federation. Other member states may prefer to be self-sufficient,
    treating the Federation as nothing more than a trade organization. Member states
    who are economically influential (especially those found in a major home system)
    are notorious for being able to leverage greater rights than what traditions would
    typically allow.\n\n\n#####Legal\nThe laws of a member state are their own, but
    they must not be in violation of Federal Law. Moreover, member states are expected
    to pass their own laws that reflect any legislation made by the Federation government.
    This enhances the perception of a member state's freedom, as they are able to
    implement the Federation's wide-sweeping legislation in forms that are compatible
    with the culture and society of their jurisdiction. This has given the reputation
    of the Federation government being a very distant entity; even if the majority
    of a member state's laws are derived from higher authorities, they will appear
    to be a product of the local government. Member states who fail to abide by Federal
    Law are either fined or placed under economic sanction, though they can appeal
    to the Supreme Court in such instances.\n\nA certain number of member states are
    designated as having the power of opt-out by the Federation government. This means
    that these signatories can refuse to take part in any aspects of the Federation\u2019s
    laws. This is highly controversial for a number of reasons, as citizens from opt-out
    territories can still vote in Federation elections, leading to criticisms regarding
    political inequality. Opt-outs are deemed as necessary for appeasing nations who
    do not perceive themselves as compatible with the Federation, yet their continued
    membership is seen as critical to the union\u2019s wellbeing. \n\nThe most notable
    example of a signatory with the power of opt-out is the nation of Jin-Mei. The
    Jin-Mei are regarded as key financial players in the Federation yet have opted-out
    of clauses that compromise their caste system. Other signatories with the most
    opt-outs reside mainly in the Luminaire and Intaki solar systems. Special ruling
    can override an opt-out in theory, but the severe and potentially fatal backlash
    this would cause means this has never been done in Federation history.\n\n\n####Colonies\nThe
    member colonies of the Federation are considered one of the union\u2019s main
    building blocks. Many Federation signatories were once colonies that acquired
    independence to become a nation unto itself. Colonies fall under various different
    administrations depending on who they have been established by and where they
    have been founded. The largest and most successful colonies tend to be those settled
    by member states themselves, followed by corporate settlements.\n\nAs all colonies
    must be democratic, a colonial government is typically composed of an elected
    director and their staff. As the size of the colony expands, more advanced government
    trappings may be adopted. Their administrative style and format tend to follow
    the mother culture of the colony.\n\n\n#####Government and corporate colonies\nColonies
    established by member states have various rights entitled to them by the Federal
    Charter. Their mother nation is expected to take care of military protection and
    ensure that the rights of these colonists are identical to the citizens living
    back home. If a colony and/or its citizens feel it is not being taken care of
    by its home country, it can protest to the local district court or the Federal
    Supreme Court with its grievances.\n\nCorporations who wish to establish a colony
    typically have to acquire permission to do so from the nearest authority, either
    a member state or district government. Colonies established beyond the borders
    of the Federation who desire political representation and/or association are accountable
    solely to Federal Law.\n\n\n#####Independent colonies\nIndependent colonies established
    by non-governmental and non-corporate groups or individuals can exist in unclaimed
    areas, particularly in so-called \u2018unorganized systems\u2019(where no member
    states reside). They may peripherally tie themselves to or freely associate with
    a member state elsewhere (through trade or paying taxes for example) in exchange
    for political representation and/or other benefits. Many of these independent
    colonies forgo paying taxes altogether, thus lacking any political representation.
    These types of colonies can be controversial in the Federation, particularly settlements
    established by immigrant groups (such as [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) clans
    or former Amarr slaves). Local laws and opinions on them vary greatly.\n\nFounding
    colonies in areas already inhabited by previously unknown indigenous groups (such
    as planetary tribes) is a problematic practice in the Federation. Unlike other
    empires, the Federation considers all individuals on its planets as entitled to
    citizenship by default, especially individuals who have always resided on a world.
    Nonetheless, long legal battles have been conducted by colonists who feel their
    rights as frontierspeople are greater than those of \u2018uncivilized\u2019 birth.
    No clear law has emerged on this practice.\n\n\n#####Capsuleer colonies\nA new
    development as of YC112, colonies run by independent capsuleers in the Federation
    are founded by negotiating with the local member state (or district in the case
    of an unorganized system), either by the capsuleer personally or a representative.
    They may be staffed by local citizens. In instances when the affected authority
    is unhappy with the colony\u2019s establishment (even with the ISK involved in
    the equation), the colony would be inhabited by drones and/or off-worlders instead.\n\nThere
    are reports of independent capsuleers threatening member states reluctant to allow
    capsuleer operations in their borders with orbital bombardment. The Federation
    has since gone out of its way to remind its signatories that these attempts at
    coercions are bluffs, and that the sovereignty of a member planet is not at the
    dictat of independent capsuleers.\n\n\n#####Ascension\nOnce a colony reaches a
    certain size, it can apply to the Federal Administration to become a full member
    signatory of the Charter. A colony must consider whether the benefits of becoming
    a full Federation member outweigh the downsides. Often, a home nation or its controlling
    corporation may not want to relinquish authority of their colony vassal for various
    economic or political reasons, and frequently attempt to do everything in its
    power to prevent the colony from ascending to full membership. Capsuleer colonies
    are unlikely to ascend at this present time, due to the fact that few have been
    founded with any sense of permanency. This is the main process that previously
    uninhabited areas of the Federation have achieved full political franchise and
    representation.\n\n\n####Registered megalopoli\nA registered megalopolis is a
    special planetside city that is entitled to autonomy independent of the district
    and member state it is enclaved by. Effectively city-states that wield enough
    economic and political influence that rival entire solar systems, many registered
    megalopoli are considered microcosms of the wider Federation. These cities are
    highly cosmopolitan, well-travelled, and well-integrated with New Eden\u2019s
    economy.\n\nRegistered megapoli universally use a three branch system, composed
    of a mayor, city council, and local court. They are also counted as a sub-district,
    granting it a single seat on the Federation Senate. Becoming a registered megalopolis
    is no easy feat, and it is possible for the Federation to revoke the prestigious
    status if the city does not live up to the standard expected.\n\n[Hueromont](1PzpjLA0ZHtQRZu2f8x4gO)
    and Des Ponticelles are two of the most well-known registered megalopoli in the
    Federation, having never lost the status. Although [Caille](73TXaac6RTgSJaqJHkTxCz)
    is far more of a major political and economic player than these two cities, it
    has never submitted itself to become a registered megapolis, preferring to remain
    the capital of its ancient Garoun state.\n\n\n####FCTs\nFederally-Controlled Territories
    (or FCTs) are under the direct control of the Federation government. The capitals
    of the Federation are FCTs, as well as the Gallente Border Zone constellation.
    Smaller FCTs exist across Federation space, mostly military bases or prisons.
    The Federation must negotiate to establish an FCT in a territory already under
    the control of another authority. In the case of the capitals, the Federation
    often devolves powers to smaller areas for the purposes of bureaucratic ease.
    Unlike the rest of the Federation, these powers are not protected, and can be
    revoked by the central government at any time.\n\n###Branches\nThe responsibilities
    of the central Federation government, or FedGov, are the following;\n\n- Representation
    of all Federation nations and citizens to non-signatories\n- Maintenance of the
    union's cohesion for the benefit of all Federation participants\n- Promotion of
    the articles present in the Federation's founding treaties\n\nEffectively, FedGov
    is an interstellar regulatory body that binds the union together by executing
    and upholding the values laid out in the Federation Charter and Constitution.
    It is made up of a three branch system composed of an executive, legislature,
    and judiciary, all with clear separation of powers. The intent of this system
    is to prevent one arm from gaining undue influence over the affairs of either
    the other two branches, the wider Federation, or both. There are as many as three
    capitals to symbolically emphasize this principle, although Villore IV (better
    known as Libertopolis) is the symbolic capital world.\n\nThe Federation government
    operates on a semi-direct or hybrid democratic system. The intent of this is to
    strike a balance between the flaws of both full direct and full representative
    systems, where the former may see the oppression of minorities by majorities,
    and the latter may result in an oligarchy that only superficially interacts with
    its constituents. While the Federal government has very rarely fallen to either
    extreme wholesale, it has exhibited tendencies in different areas to varying degrees
    occasionally throughout its history. While turnouts for public referenda at the
    Federal level is only 10% on average (which can throw the legitimacy of these
    votes into question), it is generally accepted that citizens who do participate
    are those who will be the most affected by the outcome.\n\nCompared to the interstellar
    governments of other empires, the Federation government has no influence on the
    average citizen, at least not without going through many layers of separation.
    This is because FedGov's power is mostly military or economic in nature. While
    this ensures that individual and social freedoms are protected from off-world
    influence, it does mean that enforcement against violations of such may be lax.
    It is the member states who are entrusted with carrying forward the Federal government\u2019s
    decisions to their respective citizens. The extremely light touch the Federation
    has on its citizens has resulted in the low rates of political participation at
    the interstellar level.\n\n\n####Executive\nThe President heads up the executive
    branch, which is primarily composed of his or her cabinet and the [Federal Administration](3FvIDT7Y2mQEOOCLVpy3kz).
    Elections for the President run every five years, and can only be re-elected once.
    The executive branch is in charge of executing and implementing the law in the
    spirit of the Federation\u2019s principles. The President is the Chief of Command
    of the Federation armed forces.\n\nThe Office of the President is located in the
    Federation executive capital of Ladistier, with auxiliary offices found in Parts.
    The flag of the President is represented by an eagle on a green background with
    a single diagonal stripe. The eagle stands for the citizen in both Gallente and
    Caldari cultures (albeit the citizen as a free individual in the former and the
    citizen as a part of the flock in the latter), while the green coloring is designed
    to represent moral integrity. The single stripe is a gesture of an oath.\n\n\n#####Responsibilities\nThe
    responsibilities of the President are the following;\n\n- Execution of all the
    union\u2019s laws and treaties in the spirit of the Federation\u2019s founding
    principles\n- Defense of all human life from both natural and man-made threats\n-
    Ambassadorship of the Federation government on behalf of her participants to non-signatories\n\nThe
    President\u2019s first responsibility of executing the law is mostly ceremonial,
    as it is the Federal Administration who do the day-to-day work. In this area,
    Presidents are seen as nothing more than a figurehead. The President will speak
    on behalf of the bureaucracy or the entire Federation government, with each cabinet
    member also filling the role of spokesperson for the respective policy department
    they head.\n\nThe second responsibility is unique in New Eden in the sense that
    a non-combatant is in ultimate control of one of New Eden\u2019s largest militaries,
    where other empire forces are in control of a senior military figure (such as
    an [Empress][Emperor Family](IXrotYvoWOVnuGAMbbYEv)) or are otherwise a faction
    unto themselves (such as the [Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN)). Civilian
    oversight of the military is seen as key to preventing wartime atrocities taking
    place that are contradictory to the values of a liberal democracy. It is the President\u2019s
    job to ensure that all branches of the Federation armed forces do not commit actions
    that would violate Gallente ideals, such as what occurred in the beginning of
    the [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV), while still being able to
    lead them effectively against forces that would threaten the safety and security
    of the union.\n\nThe third responsibility of the President is serving as the face
    of the Federation to foreign entities. Although the Senate has certain diplomatic
    powers, the President is most frequently called upon to act as first ambassador
    to other factions, having the power to propose treaties with foreign empires to
    be approved by the legislature. Presidents have acted on their own in this regard,
    or have been at the whims of a Senate alliance.\n\n\n#####Procedures\nFor the
    defense of the Federation from natural or man-made threats, the President heads
    the Federal Security Council. It is generally regarded as the highest and most
    powerful civilian body in the Federation despite no laws ever having identified
    it as such. The Security Council is made up of relevant cabinet officials, senior
    military officers, and chairpersons of relevant Senate committees. Representatives
    from member states either affected by or in need of military action are legally
    obliged to attend Security Council meetings and briefings (which can be open or
    closed door). Though the President has ultimate command of the military, they
    almost always deliberate with the Security Council, which can be dominated by
    specific personalities who are not the chief executive. This can result in very
    long responses to military flashpoints, far slower than the response times of
    other empires. For this reason, military commanders are trained to be able to
    act decisively and without executive support, while at the same time attempting
    to minimize any potential political fallout.\n\nOn the assumption that not all
    man-made threats can be dealt with in open channels, the [Federal Intelligence
    Office](4Q7sdriIYVeeQANNNXF0nH) is under the exclusive control of the President
    (albeit with some scrutiny from the Senate), giving the chief executive great
    powers beyond their more codified roles. The FIO is considered a controversial
    entity, sometimes seen as a private military force exclusively for executive interests.
    The other branches as well as the rest of the Federation merely tolerate the existence
    of the FIO as a necessary evil, trusting the President to act morally in protecting
    the union from the hidden threats within and without it. The FIO's foreign intelligence
    network is on par with the [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G), giving the President
    international sway.\n\nThe President has certain law-making powers. The President
    can pass Federal decisions known as executive orders, which pertain to particularly
    issues requiring central intervention. Presidents can also propose voluntary Federation-wide
    initiatives to member states. The President can propose legislation to the Senate,
    but takes no part in the deliberative process. All legislation proposed by the
    President goes to public vote by default, while Senate proposals can be forced
    to go to public vote by the executive. Senate bills can be vetoed by the President,
    on the assumption that the executive has either found the proposal to be unsuitable,
    or lacking in having gone through proper deliberation.\n\nHow freely a President
    utilizes their legislative power is heavily dependent on current traditions and
    their approval level. Presidents who are puppets of Senate alliances may be maneuvered
    to reflect the will of that faction. Only Presidents who are popular with the
    Federation public would dare to propose any legislation, as the outcome of the
    subsequent plebiscite will often reflect on their current popularity. The majority
    of Presidents have stuck to using their law-making powers only when it is absolutely
    necessary, although the more recent \u2018hands-on\u2019 chief executives such
    as Souro Foiritan and Jacus Roden have discarded these long-established traditions,
    at least temporarily.\n\n\n#####Reputation\nIn many respects, the [President](UW2GqozmvYnsm1kRPpp1E)
    can be considered the most powerful individual in New Eden. This is especially
    true when the President\u2019s role of being seniormost ambassador of a diplomatically,
    culturally, and economically influential empire is combined with their command
    of New Eden\u2019s second-largest armed force (which, in addition, has the greatest
    clusterwide presence), and their near-exclusive control over an extremely extensive
    interstellar intelligence network. As this mostly concerns perceptions of interstellar
    political and military power, the average citizen is unlikely to think a President
    to have any bearing over their everyday lives.\n\nOutside of their codified responsibilities,
    the President is generally accepted to have influence in setting the impetus and
    direction for the rest of the Federation government, either on behalf of a Senate
    alliance or as an independent figurehead. Often times, the President will appear
    as an actor or actress playing the role of the kind, considerate and generous
    mother or father of the people, dispute the harsh factionalism beneath the surface.\n\n[Continues
