- body: '**Sanada** was a religious leader whose apocalyptic

    [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) sect was eventually considered too extreme by

    Amarr church authorities and excommunicated. She had been preaching on

    space stations and continued the practice with her small but devout

    group of followers, one of whom was [Auduban](C9YpzTe4NgePFlVHHzmK9).


    After being run off several stations and seeing her group of followers,

    cadre of ships and stocks of supplies all dwindle away, Sanada''s

    desperation grew, to the point where she confided in Auduban that she

    was at the point of giving up completely. Auduban, an acolyte whose

    devotion to Sanada was unwavering and fanatical, attempted to fix their

    problems by installing rigs in their single remaining vessel in the hope

    of fitting it for combat.


    He failed, miserably, and Sanada ended her physical life in the ensuing

    onboard ship systems failures, though her physical remains - and,

    possibly, spirit - remained of some import to the crazed Auduban and the

    scheme he eventually concocted.
