- body: '**Nale** started off as a terminally ill person recruited by the

    [Sisters of EVE](77ihwsVRHRojCaPC5XZn2g). He had worked, in family

    tradition, as a miner on [asteroid colonies](6NQhah6uyVb1Bzg0ifUe5N), though his
    profession - if any -

    at the time of his diagnosis was unknown. He had no known surviving

    relatives. After blood analysis, an [AI](67UaJpJzvXXlhQc8a0GnWR) doctor predicted

    he had between six and eighteen months to live, based on median data.

    Amazingly, Nale managed - possibly in shock, but still - to accept the

    judgment with good grace and found that it led to an awakening of the

    possibilities of life. Shortly after, he was recruited by an unnamed

    Sisters of EVE operative who, upon discovering his affinity for a

    particular mind-control device codenamed the Book of Emptiness,

    recruited him to a secret search squad.
