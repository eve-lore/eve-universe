    limb. They are typically used when limbs are lost via accident or\nmedically-necessitated
    amputation, but some choose to have limbs\nreplaced with prosthetics for body-augmentation
    or other reasons. The\nsimplest prosthetics are little more than hooks or pegs
    that replicate\nonly the crudest functionality of the appendage, while the most\ncomplicated
    (and expensive) can surpass ordinary human abilities.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nProsthetics
    have been used throughout human history to aid those who\nhave lost a limb through
    injury. The earliest prosthetics were simple\ndevices, typically carved from wood
    or bone, and were vastly inferior to\nthe limb they replaced. Peg legs can allow
    a person to walk, but they do\na poor job at motor control and balance. Hooks
    can crudely grasp some\nobjects, but cannot manipulate them to any intricate degree.\n\nFor
    thousands of years, prosthetics remained troublesome. Even as\ntechnological advances
    made them more complicated and more capable of\nreplicating basic human functionality,
    prosthetics did not truly become\nequivalent to natural limbs until fairly recently.
    Currently,\ntop-of-the-line prosthetics not only resemble natural limbs without\nclose
    inspection, but they also are capable of sensory-feedback that\nsimulates the
    sense of touch, fine motor control, and augmented\nstrength. The best prosthetics
    are even capable of surpassing human\nlimits, such as enhancing strength, fine
    control, and agility.\n\nTypes\n-----\n\nProsthetics can be grouped into three
    rough categories based on\nsophistication and the purpose behind the device. These
    are Basic\nReplacements, Cybernetic Limbs, and Augmentative Prosthetics.\n\n###
    Basic Replacements\n\nThese devices are primarily found among the poor and less
    advanced areas\nof [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk). These devices typically\nare
    obviously prosthetics, such as replacement legs shaped like curved\nmetal blades
    or hands that are immobile claws. These devices typically\nreplicate a fair amount
    of daily function of a lost limb, allowing the\nuser to live comfortably without
    much aid. However, they almost always\nhave some disadvantages over normal human
    limbs.\n\nThese disadvantages are usually an inability to make any delicate or\nprecise
    movements with the limb (such as writing or painting), a lack of\ntouch and other
    sensation, and inelegant interface with flesh leading to\naches and pains. Other
    issues may also arise, such as replacement legs\nleaving a runner with difficulty
    making sharp turns.\n\nHowever, they are advantageous in that they are readily
    available, easy\nto maintain, and inexpensive. This makes them among the most
    common\nprosthetics in New Eden, particularly among the outer colonies where\ndanger
    is frequent, medical treatment is less available, and money is\nsparse.\n\nCybernetic
    Limbs\n----------------\n\nCybernetic limbs seek to replicate as much functionality
    of the lost\nlimb as possible. They utilize robotics and neural interfaces to
    allow a\nuser to control the limb much as they would one made of flesh and bone.\nWhile
    such prosthetics take some learning to operate naturally, over\ntime users tend
    to have no more trouble using their replacements that a\nperson with their natural
    limbs.\n\nThey run the gamut from simple and relatively cheap to complicated and\nexpensive.
    The simplest replacements typically have less motor control\nand sensory feedback
    than human limbs, but still give these to some\ndegree. A user might be able to
    throw a ball, but would have difficulty\npicking a flower without crushing it,
    for instance. More advanced models\nare capable of the same delicate movements
    as a normal human limb, but\nare more costly to manufacture and require more regular
    maintenance.\n\nMost are made to resemble the lost appendage as much as possible,
    using\nfake skin colored to match the natural tone and appearance. However,\nthey
    can be left bare if desired, or even made from a variety of colors\nand materials.
    In professions where damage to the covering might be\nfrequent, such as mercenary
    work, the limbs can be left uncovered to\nprevent the need for constant repair.
    Notably, the \n[Ardishapur Family](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO) has a tradition of replacing
    the\nright hand of all males with a silver prosthesis at birth, making no\neffort
    to disguise its cybernetic nature.\n\nAugmentative Prosthetics\n------------------------\n\nAugmentative
    prosthetics seek to push past the limitations of the human\nbody with cybernetics.
    These devices are similar in many ways to\nstandard cybernetic limbs, but take
    the idea a step further by\npossessing abilities beyond the human baseline. These
    augmented\nabilities can take a variety of forms, such as increased strength,\nbetter
    fine motor control, increased sensitivity, or even hidden\nweaponry.\n\nThe most
    common augmentative prosthetics simply increase the strength of\nthe limb to superhuman
    levels, allowing a person to lift large weights\nor inflict serious wounds with
    a simple unarmed strike. They are\npopular among mercenaries and criminals for
    this reason, though other\nindividuals might make use of these abilities as well.\n\nArtists
    such as painters and sculptors have taken advantage of\naugmentations with improved
    control to create intricate works that are\nnearly impossible to create by hand
    otherwise. Some have pointed out the\nhypocrisy of this, as it still replaces
    human skill with technological\nassistance, but the limbs are still controlled
    directly by the brain and\nnot through automation.\n\nEven more bizarre prosthetics
    are possible, such as the replacement of a\nhand with a weapon, or legs that can
    elongate by a meter or more, or\nfeet with built-in wheels. There even exists
    a subcommunity of the\n[Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) body-modding scene which
    utilizes\naugmentations for sexual reasons.\n\nBecause of the dangerous nature
    of augmentative prosthetics, they are\nheavily regulated by [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt)
    and the\n[empires](Empire-Factions). Typically anyone possessing one\nmust register
    them with law enforcement, particularly if they can be\nused as a weapon. In areas
    outside civilized space, however, they can be\ncome by readily as long as those
    interested have the money to spend.\n\nNaturally, such augmentations are far more
    expensive than even standard\ncybernetic limbs and must also be maintained constantly.
    The additional\ncapabilities of the augmentations can also take several years
    to become\ncomfortable. Some, particularly those with extra sensitivity, have
    been\nshown to cause minor nerve damage and neural degradation, though these\ncan
    be treated with drugs.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n-   [Health Items](1atx3NGYkl3oP5JiEa1ShQ#health)\n-
