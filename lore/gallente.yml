- body: "## Gallente Federation\n\nPerhaps the most controversial of all the empires,
    the Gallente Federation is many different things\u2014depending on who you ask.
    To their supporters, they are the largest and most enduring democracy in New Eden
    and a bastion for equality and justice. To their detractors, they are velvetgloved
    imperialist bullies, incapable of truly acknowledging any culture other than their
    own.\n\nLife in the federation has often been described as utopian, and provided
    you are privileged enough to live in the luxury of the core worlds, this is likely
    true. As long as people don\u2019t cause harm to others, they are allowed to live
    their lives more or less in whatever manner they please. Poets, scholars, and
    politicians are revered, with citizens often flocking in droves to adopt the latest
    cause, movement, fad, or combination thereof. Opportunity is abundant. Life is
    easy and free of want.\n\nOf course, this freedom comes at a price. Vice runs
    rampant in the federation. Fulfilling any desire you may possess is a simple matter.
    Things that might be considered immoral or illegal in the rest of the cluster
    tend to be readily accessible here. Drugs, body modification, prostitution, gambling:
    if you have the money, virtually anything that can be imagined can be enjoyed.\n\nIt\u2019s
    not all debauchery, though; there exists a heavily right-wing movement among the
    Gallente. These nationalistic groups feel the roots of the federation are slowly
    being eroded by outside influences. To their mind the federal way is the only
    way. Let the masses have their drug orgies, blissfully unaware that their privilege
    to do so exists only because certain people are willing to do the more unpalatable
    work that must be done. And should anyone object to these powers, well, people
    have been known to disappear into the morass of federation society.\n\nDespite
    its flaws, the federation is still held up as a bulwark of freedom and individuality,
    and remains a land of opportunity where the outcast and discontent can seek comfort
    and succor.\n"

- body: "## History\n\n### Pre-Federation Years\n\nThe seeds of the federation were
    planted when the original ethnic Gallente discovered another civilization living
    within their solar system. Gallente scientists spotted the Caldari entering their
    Industrial Age in AD 22463 and immediately dispatched probes to establish contact.
    Soon after, they were sending manned missions with the intent of mingling with
    and assisting what was seen as a primitive people. The Caldari eagerly accepted
    the Gallente\u2019s technology, but remained wary of cultural interference.\n\nEven
    so, the two cultures gradually came to trust each other and work together. Side
    by side, they discovered star gate technology and eventually developed the warp
    drive. This sped their ability to explore and colonize the cluster. The Gallente
    took charge, somewhat to the detriment of the Caldari, who were occasionally treated
    as an afterthought when it came to interstellar politics.\n\nThe Gallente encountered
    several more races in turn. First were the Intaki, a low-technology race living
    on a lush, junglecovered planet. The Intaki were far more open to Gallente culture
    than the Caldari had been. Quickly embracing the new technology, they took to
    the stars.\n\nSoon after, the Gallente came into contact with the Mannar, a group
    of divided nations who had long been at war with each other. In this case, since
    several of the more powerful Mannar nations were slave owners, Gallente intervention
    proved problematic. Initially the Gallente tried to ply the slavers with technology,
    expecting them to give up their practice in return for great strides forward in
    technological capacity. When the slavers failed to uphold their end of the bargain,
    the Gallente wasted no time in giving all their technology to the slavers\u2019
    enemies, in addition to helping them form a unified coalition. Only a few years
    later, the slavers had been defeated.\n\nSoon enough all the nations under the
    Gallente banner had begun establishing independent colonies in the Verge Vendor
    region, and as there were no rules or regulations on colonization, this is where
    the first real conflicts between them arose. Many times, planets claimed by one
    nation were colonized by another, leading to heated disputes which often ended
    in bloodshed, and eventually the Gallente decided the best way to bring peace
    to their part of the cluster was to propose an interstellar federation of nations.\n\n###
    Birth of the Federation\n\nThe diplomatic union of independent states known as
    the Federated Union of Gallente Prime (more commonly known as the Gallente Federation)
    was officially founded in AD 23121. The Gallente, Intaki, Mannar, Caldari, and
    many of the independent states of Verge Vendor were signatories to the Federal
    Charter, which outlined the rights of all states and all the regulations they
    were expected to follow. The primacy of the Gallente in the federation owed to
    their domination economically, technologically, and in sheer population.\n\nAlong
    with the federation came many of the institutions that govern it today. A senate
    was convened to represent the interests of each of the members, with senators
    democratically elected from the constituent nations. From among them they would
    elect a president. While no supreme court was established, a special senate committee
    was put together to adjudicate international disputes. Finally, a combined navy
    was created, primarily to patrol against piracy and keep the peace.\n\n### A Lack
    of Communication\n\nOne of the first missions of the newly minted federation was
    a rapid expansion of their colonization efforts. With a centralized bureaucracy
    directing efforts, exploration of the region now known as Everyshore was swift.
    The Mannar were aggressive in settling the region, putting pressure on the new
    federation by settling on several worlds already claimed by other federal member
    states. It quickly became apparent that these issues were largely caused by the
    sluggishness of interstellar communication protocols. Fortunately, these growing
    pains were soon solved with the discovery of faster-than-light (FTL) communications
    by the Gallente scientist Li Azbel. Within a year, the federation was constructing
    comm relays all across explored space.\n\n### Gallente Hegemony\n\nWhile the new
    FTL network enabled the federation to expand and explore more easily, it had another
    unexpected effect. The Gallente were now able to quickly export their massive
    diversity of media, carrying their culture and ideals directly to the doorsteps
    of billions who had previously only known them as distant influences. This led
    to a fairly rapid shift in attitudes throughout the federation\u2019s constituent
    states, a secondary effect which aligned the majority of them more closely with
    the culture and morals of Gallente Prime.\n\nThe issue of human rights became
    an interstellar concern. The Gallente-dominated Senate convened to propose a new
    constitution which would turn the federation from a collection of sovereign states
    into a singular political entity. While the majority were in favor, the primary
    objections came from the Caldari and, to a lesser extent, the Intaki. Eventually,
    the Gallente had their way, and the Mannar, Intaki, and Caldari were no longer
    independent from the Gallente. They were now united under one banner.\n\n### Outbreak
    of War\n\nThe Caldari had long chafed against the Gallente\u2019s larger population,
    more robust economy, and superior technology. For decades, the megacorporations
    who had come to oversee Caldari life had been secretly spreading beyond the reach
    of the Gallente, founding hidden colonies and thereby violating several of the
    federation\u2019s directives.\n\nWhen this was discovered, the Senate quickly
    organized an emergency summit demanding the Caldari megacorporations relinquish
    the colonies. The corporations\u2014by this time the most influential factor in
    Caldari life\u2014balked at the proposal, and after meeting in an emergency session,
    the CEOs of the top eight corporations on Caldari formed a ruling body named the
    Chief Executive Panel (more commonly known as CEP) and declared their independence
    from the federation. The new nation would be called the Caldari State.\n\nThe
    federally sanctioned Caldari government showed firm solidarity with their old
    compatriots, yielding control of their militaries and resources to the CEP. Immediately,
    the new Caldari State secured the star gate network that led to their colonies.
    In response, the federation blockaded Caldari Prime, hoping to starve the Caldari
    population and force them into capitulation.\n\n### Nouvelle Rouvenor\n\nA tense
    standoff ensued. The Caldari, accustomed to life on their harsh home world, hunkered
    down and refused to budge. The Gallente, assured of their own superiority, believed
    it was a simple matter of time before the Caldari would give in. For months the
    stalemate dragged on.\n\nThings came to a head when a group of Caldari partisans
    known as the Templis Dragonaurs bombed the city of Nouvelle Rouvenor, a domed
    underwater dwelling inhabited primarily by people of Gallente descent. The attack
    devastated the city, sending nearly all of the half-million-strong populace to
    a watery grave.\n\n### Rise of the Ultranationalists\n\nThe Gallente people demanded
    a response to the destruction of Nouvelle Rouvenor. The president resigned in
    disgrace, claiming her inaction had led to the disaster. A fascist party called
    the Ultranationalists were swept into power. The new president, Luc Duvailer,
    suspended the constitution, declaring the war a national emergency which could
    only be responded to with immediate and unquestioned action.\n\nDuvailer ordered
    the Federation Navy to begin bombarding Caldari Prime. With billions of inhabitants
    still residing on the planet, even those bombings intended solely as tactical
    in nature carried with them heavy civilian death tolls. Within a day, hundreds
    of thousands\u2014Caldari and Gallente alike\u2014were dead, as street after district
    after neighborhood after landmark were wiped off the map.\n\nIt was President
    Duvailer\u2019s belief that such a harsh assault would quickly break the will
    of the Caldari and force them to surrender. Instead, the Caldari refused to submit.
    On Caldari Prime, the natives\u2019 superior knowledge of the terrain gave them
    a massive advantage. The Federation Navy often found itself bombarding deserted
    settlements, while the Federation Army chased phantoms across empty tundra.\n\n###
    Morning of Reason\n\nDespite their surprising resilience, the Caldari were undergoing
    internal schisms. Some members of the CEP, seeing the destruction being wrought
    upon their home world, were in favor of capitulation. Others were insistent on
    fighting, claiming surrender would destroy the Caldari more surely than the devastation
    of Caldari Prime. For a while the two sides were nearly deadlocked, but eventually
    the militant contingent won out, forcing those in favor of making peace into the
    deadly Tea Maker\u2019s Ceremony, a form of ritual suicide deeply rooted within
    Caldari tradition.\n\nThe remaining CEP members realized Caldari Prime was a lost
    cause. They devised an evacuation plan, but the Gallente blockade of Caldari Prime
    prevented them from fully carrying it out. They anticipated that at least a month
    of complete orbital control would be required before the evacuation would be complete.
    So far, they had yet to achieve it for even a day.\n\n### Federal Schisms\n\nMeanwhile,
    the Ultranationalist regime was beginning to show signs of strain. The Gallente
    were loath to live under martial law, but protests were quickly silenced. Even
    government officials who objected found themselves rapidly removed from their
    posts. The situation in the military was little better, as competent leaders resigned
    in the face of questionable orders from President Duvailer.\n\nOne flashpoint
    came on Intaki Prime, where several pro- Caldari movements sprang up across the
    planet. In an effort to squash the problem, Duvailer ordered the arrest of the
    five thousand Intaki deemed most threatening to the federation. This group was
    composed of everyone from peaceful activists to rebel leaders to perpetrators
    of violent anti-Gallente crimes. Rather than imprison them and thereby create
    a locus point for further protests (or, worse, execute them and turn them into
    martyrs), Duvailer elected to exile them from the federation.\n\n### Caldari Counterstrike\n\nWith
    the capabilities of the Federation Navy eroded by loss of leadership, the Caldari
    slowly gained an advantage. The young Caldari Navy was able to slowly push the
    federation out of orbit and place them on the defensive. Knowing they could not
    hold out indefinitely, they swiftly set about evacuating the planet. Two weeks
    passed, as the Gallente mustered their forces for a counteroffensive. The Chief
    Executive Panel realized they could not hold out, no matter how ineffective the
    federation\u2019s leadership. With heavy hearts, they ordered all forces to retreat
    and abandon the evacuation attempt.\n\nDecorated Caldari Navy admiral Yakiya Tovil-Toba,
    however, disobeyed these orders. Taking his loyal fleet of a few dozen ships,
    he set course directly for Gallente Prime, where he made a stunning guerrilla-style
    counterattack. The federation, unprepared, sustained heavy initial losses. Believing
    Tovil-Toba to be in the vanguard of a full offensive, the Federation Navy abandoned
    its short-term plans and diverted a great deal of resources toward destroying
    the admiral.\n\nUsing his mastery of fleet movement and subterfuge, Tovil- Toba
    tactically withdrew, then struck where the federation was at its most vulnerable.
    For a week he sustained this, keeping the federation on its heels while the rest
    of the Caldari Navy redoubled its evacuation efforts. The federation knew it was
    allowing the evacuation of Caldari Prime to continue unopposed, but with Tovil-Toba
    in such close proximity to Gallente Prime, they could not risk their previously
    planned offensive.\n\nGradually Tovil-Toba\u2019s forces were whittled away, until
    only a single carrier remained. Less than a quarter of the Caldari remained on
    their home world. Knowing he could not buy further time through combat, Tovil-Toba
    played a final gambit. He ordered his ship directly into Gallente Prime\u2019s
    orbit. The Federation Navy quickly intercepted him, but Tovil-Toba had not come
    there to fight. Instead, he pointed his ship down at the city of Hueromont. As
    his ship entered the atmosphere, it broke into pieces, killing everyone onboard,
    and one of the largest fragments of the ship slammed into the city with catastrophic
    force.\n\nThe resulting explosion killed two million people more or less instantly,
    with millions more perishing in the coming days from fallout, fires, and other
    injuries. The sky was blackened for kilometers around as dust and debris filled
    the atmosphere. The federation, horrified, ordered all ships to remain in orbit
    on the defensive. The Caldari had been freed to complete the evacuation of their
    home world.\n\n### Fall of the U-Nats\n\nThe destruction of Hueromont exposed
    the failings of federation leadership to the Gallente people. Military desertions,
    already rampant, became epidemic. Protests erupted every day in the cities, unopposed
    by law enforcement. Several of the federation\u2019s constituent states set their
    local militias in opposition to the Ultranationalist government.\n\nA standoff
    ensued, which ended when President Duvailer finally admitted defeat by lifting
    martial law. Immediately, the Senate passed a vote of no confidence in the president,
    with even formerly Ultranationalist senators siding against him. Duvailer was
    forced to step down.\n\n### Rest and Reconstruction\n\nSeveral problems faced
    the new president. Caldari Prime, though depopulated, was still of economic and
    symbolic importance to the federation. A few million Gallente still lived on the
    planet, and a number of Caldari had refused to evacuate. The government thus had
    no choice but to pour money into rebuilding incentives.\n\nSecondly, the Ultranationalist-ordered
    bombardment of Caldari Prime came to be seen as attempted genocide. Luc Duvailer
    and much of the U-Nat leadership were arrested and put on trial for war crimes.
    Though they vehemently denied the genocide charges, most of them, including Duvailer
    himself, were found guilty. Many were placed into prison for life; Duvailer was
    exiled and died in obscurity.\n\nThe Caldari continued to be viewed as rebels
    who threatened the stability of the federation, but in the chaos of the U-Nats\u2019
    downfall they had been given time to fortify their positions and build up their
    navy. The war quickly shifted from hot to cold, with the majority of engagements
    coming in the form of small border skirmishes rather than grand offensives.\n\n###
    The Amarr Empire\n\nNot long after, in AD 23180, the Gallente made first contact
    with the Amarr. The federation was shocked to find another civilization of a size
    and technology level comparable to their own. Even more worrying was the revelation
    that the Amarr practiced the barbaric tradition of slavery. As each side became
    more aware of the other\u2019s capabilities, each realized that allout conflict
    would do more harm than good to both of them.\n\nAs a result, despite being almost
    diametrically opposed culturally, the two sides negotiated treaties. The first
    was the Gallente-Amarr Free Trade Agreement, signed in AD 23210. Despite the name,
    the treaty was quite restrictive in nature, in order to assuage worries from both
    sides. Regardless, this served to bring the two to an uneasy peace.\n\n### The
    War Continues\n\nMeanwhile, the Gallente-Caldari War began to heat up once again.
    In an attempt to force the federation to return Caldari Prime to them, the Caldari
    made attacks on several federation border worlds. The federation in turn fought
    back by making strikes on Caldari colonies and attempting to capture territory.
    The Caldari slowly gained an advantage thanks to their development of single-man
    fighters, able to outmaneuver and hold down the much larger Gallente ships. The
    Gallente were put on the defensive, and for a while it seemed as if the Caldari
    would be able to push them all the way back to their home system of Luminaire.\n\nThe
    Gallente\u2019s development of the combat drone, however, changed the scenario
    drastically. Originally little more than proximity mines with limited movement
    capabilities, drones soon advanced to the level where a single drone was nearly
    a match for a single fighter. Crucially, because they were much cheaper to produce
    and required no pilots, the drones quickly swung the tide back in favor of the
    Gallente.\n\nJust as borders were pushed back to their original positions, the
    Caldari completed their new upgraded fighter class, a slightly larger ship which
    sacrificed some maneuverability in favor of stronger armaments. While frigates
    did not prove as dominant as the Caldari had hoped, they did halt the Gallente
    advance, returning the conflict to a simmering stalemate.\n\n### Minmatar Assistance\n\nThe
    plight of the Minmatar enslaved by the Amarr had incited the anger of citizens
    across the federation. Despite repeated calls for military intervention, however,
    the federation government knew it could not risk open confrontation. The Empire\u2019s
    military was of roughly equal strength, unburdened by the pressures of a separate
    war.\n\nThis did not stop elements within the federation from covertly supporting
    the Minmatar rebels. There were even rumors the federation government itself was
    arming the rebels. When the Amarr made the strategic error of attempting to invade
    the Jove Empire, the Minmatar rose up in mass rebellion. Working alongside the
    Jove, the federation began to more overtly provide the Minmatar with weapons and
    advisers.\n\nWithin a few months, the Minmatar had carved out significant territory
    from the reeling Amarr. The federation quickly acknowledged the Minmatar as a
    sovereign state and sent experts to assist them in forming a new government, with
    the result that many of the newly minted republic\u2019s governmental institutions
    were modeled after the structures of the federation, with a prime minister, parliament,
    and justice department mirroring the president, senate, and supreme court.\n\n###
    Iyen-Oursta\n\nThough the war with the Caldari had been at a stalemate for decades,
    in AD 23224 the Caldari frigates suddenly became far more dangerous and maneuverable.
    It was soon revealed that the Jove, despite working closely with the federation
    to assist the Minmatar, had provided the Caldari with the hydrostatic capsule,
    a technology that allowed them to eliminate the necessity for all but a single
    crew member. Though the technology was experimental and very dangerous, those
    select few able to use it became unmatched in battle, and these elite units were
    able to push the federation back.\n\nFinally, both sides began to muster their
    forces for a massive push. For a variety of reasons, the two sides met in the
    system of Iyen-Oursta. Confident of victory, both sides brought the majority of
    their forces to the front. The result was the second-largest battle in the history
    of New Eden, second only to the Battle of Vak\u2019Atioth in the Amarr-Jove War.
    The battle raged for nearly an entire day. The Federation Navy took crippling
    losses, but inflicted similar destruction in return. In the end, the Caldari Navy
    was forced off the field, allowing the federation to claim victory despite suffering
    far greater losses.\n\n### The War Ends\n\nOn the back of his vital role in founding
    CONCORD (see chapter titled \u201CCONCORD\u201D), the Gallente entrepreneur and
    philanthropist Aidonis Elabon was swept into the Gallente presidency. Continuing
    his role as peacekeeper, he immediately ordered the Federation Navy to fall back
    from the front toward more defensive positions. He also recalled all forces which
    were occupying Caldari-claimed space, save for Caldari Prime itself, using them
    to clear federation space of all Caldari influences.\n\nWhile the Chief Executive
    Panel was willing to negotiate, elements within the Senate opposed peace. Elabon
    left office in YC 6 and died of an undiagnosed autoimmune disease the next year,
    leaving behind a legacy as a peacekeeper and humanitarian. His will stipulated
    his estate would go toward a foundation dedicated to recognizing those who followed
    in his footsteps, the Aidonis Foundation.\n\nIn YC 12, CONCORD decided to test
    its mandate as a peacekeeper and intervened. By this point, the only battles were
    rare border skirmishes, with no serious effort made by either side to claim territory
    or escalate the war. Both sides were brought to the table in the border system
    of Tierijev. For six months they engaged in peace talks, until they finally reached
    a settlement.\n\nThe federation agreed to acknowledge the Caldari State as a sovereign
    entity, with all its territorial claims intact. The sole exception was Caldari
    Prime, which had been a point of contention in negotiations. Eventually, the CEP
    voted to cede it to the federation, viewing ending the war and opening trade with
    the Gallente to be more beneficial than the return of their home world. This embittered
    many Caldari patriots, but they lacked the backing to have their way."

- body: "## Political Structure\n\nThe Gallente Federation is a representative democracy
    composed of several semiautonomous states in a pluralistic union. On the federal
    level, the federation is split into sixtytwo districts, which are further subdivided
    into a number of subdistricts. These subdistricts may further encompass any number
    of individual governments composed of planets, colonies, megalopolises, or other
    political entities. The most important governmental bodies of the federation are
    the three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial.\n\n![Gallente landscape](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/43xeZgme4vbpiXdtqIFsCq/8deed33e2d5a4ad3a1794667b93f5a0d/Gallente1.png)\n\n###
    Executive\n\nThe executive branch is headed by the president, an elected official
    who is responsible for overseeing the enforcement of the federation\u2019s laws.
    A single term is five years; under recently adjusted federal law, a single president
    may serve a maximum of two terms. The president is often referred to as the most
    powerful individual in the federation and is certainly its most visible personage.
    He is expected to represent the federation both domestically and internationally
    and must serve equally as a legislator, a diplomat, and a national symbol. Additionally,
    the president is commander in chief of the federation armed forces, putting him
    in control of one of the largest militaries in the cluster. Such civilian oversight
    of the military is seen as a key component in ensuring the federation adheres
    to its ideals and remains a free, liberal, democratic nation.\n\nThe president
    has limited lawmaking powers; he is able to pass executive orders which pertain
    to the operation of the federal government as a whole. The president can also
    propose legislation to the Senate or member states, putting such proposals to
    public vote, but has no role in the deliberative process. He can also force deadlocked
    senatorial proposals to go to public vote in order to ensure important issues
    do not get bogged down in bureaucracy. The president can also veto bills passed
    by the Senate, sending them back to be potentially reworked and voted on a second
    time.\n\nHow much a standing president utilizes his legislative powers depends
    heavily on the current political climate. Only those presidents who are popular
    with the electorate are likely to have the political sway needed to be heavily
    influential in lawmaking. Souro Foiritan, the previous president, was extremely
    engaged in lawmaking, proposing the legislation that allowed him to be elected
    to a second term. His successor, Jacus Roden, has also extensively utilized the
    ability to put laws to public vote.\n\n### Legislative\n\nThe Federation Senate
    is the primary body of the federation\u2019s legislative branch. The Senate is
    composed of 901 individual members who serve terms of five years. They are elected
    on a staggered cycle, with 180 new senators coming in each year. Each senator
    is elected in her subdistrict by popular vote. A subdistrict varies in size according
    to population and may be as large as an entire solar system or as small as a single
    planet. The number of subdistricts in a district is similarly determined by population,
    meaning some districts have fewer senators than others.\n\nA single senator is
    elected by the Senate itself to serve as head senator. The head senator acts as
    an arbitrator and facilitator of the legislature\u2019s proceedings. The current
    head senator is Alumont Meis, who took over for the departing Mentas Blaque. Meis
    has been far less active in attempting to set senatorial policy than Blaque, who
    quite vocally directed proceedings.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s primary responsibility
    is to create new laws and eliminate old ones, with an emphasis on projecting or
    protecting the ideals of the Federal Charter and the Constitution. Any senator
    can propose a bill, which typically passes through several stages of committees
    before being put forward for a vote. These committees are composed of senators
    with personal experience in a specific area of policy, such as internal security,
    international trade, or immigration.\n\nDepending on the nature of the bill, the
    Senate can either vote on it internally or put it to public referendum. The president
    or head senator can force any bill to be put to public vote, but this measure
    is rarely used. Instead, the Senate votes, requiring a simple majority for proposed
    bills or a twothirds majority for amendments or to overturn a presidential veto.
    Once a bill has been passed, it must be signed into law by the president.\n\nThe
    Senate also sets the annual federal budget and taxation. Senatorial committees
    have immense sway in determining the budget. Different committees exist to oversee
    every aspect of the federal administration, including the military and intelligence
    agencies. Wrangling over the finer points of budget can occupy much senatorial
    time.\n\n### Judicial\n\nThe Supreme Court serves as the highest court in the
    federation and is the head of the judicial branch. It comprises thirteen justices,
    all appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The justices serve
    for life, with the chief justice being the most senior.\n\nThe primary concern
    of the Supreme Court is to interpret federal law. This typically implies hearing
    cases which are related to the conduct of member states, megacorporations, and
    other interstellar bodies. Most of these cases involve disputes between these
    entities, or ones which fall outside or transcend their jurisdictions. Though
    it reserves the right to hear appeals from any lesser court in the federation,
    it rarely does so, preferring to allow the high courts of the federation\u2019s
    constituents to rule on cases which occur entirely within their jurisdictions.\n\nThe
    Supreme Court can declare any law to be in violation of the Federal Charter or
    the Constitution, nullifying it completely. It never does this without a case
    challenging the law being brought before it, but these rulings are considered
    binding and cannot be overruled by either the president or the Senate.\n\n###
    Member States\n\nWhile not nearly as important in a clusterwide sense as the four
    larger empires, to those with a keen interest in politics, the federation\u2019s
    constituent governments can be far more fascinating than anything else in New
    Eden. While all governments under the umbrella must follow a few specific rules\u2014they
    must be democracies and have universal suffrage, and slavery is forbidden\u2014they
    are allowed great latitude in how they are run.\n\nThe Jin-Mei, for instance,
    continue to have a caste-based society, with a government almost completely dominated
    by the traditional ruling class. While they technically allow anyone to run for
    office, cultural pressures keep the Sang Do rulers firmly in power. Appointed
    officials remain the domain of the Saan Go caste, while the Jing Ko continue to
    work toward less prestigious ends happily (at least according to those who are
    asked, or allowed to speak).\n\nOther unique variations include one planet which
    requires all its governmental officials to be ordained members of some religion,
    another where the governor is selected by a lottery weighted by election results,
    and yet another where elected officials must be under the age of thirty. Of course,
    these are the exceptions, tending to be viewed as rustic and even somewhat silly
    by the federation at large. It is reasoned, however, that if anyone disapproves
    of living that way, they can easily relocate to somewhere with a government more
    to their liking.\n\nThe majority of local governments in the federation are much
    more aligned with the federal government than the fringe cases mentioned above,
    and the maneuvering between politicians as they attempt to garner votes can provide
    great theater. Because federation voter turnout tends to be fairly low\u2014as
    little as 10 percent in places\u2014motivating the electorate by whatever means
    necessary is tantamount to victory. This can lead to some fairly underhanded campaigns,
    where every last speck of dirt on a candidate\u2019s profile comes under the microscope.\n\n###
    Federal Intelligence Office\n\nThough not part of the three branches of the federation\u2019s
    government, the Federal Intelligence Office, or FIO, has played an important role
    in the government, particularly in more recent years. The FIO, led by former senator
    Mentas Blaque and his special operatives known as the Black Eagles, is mandated
    with securing the safety of the federation against traitors, terrorists, foreign
    agents, and other potential malcontents.\n\nThe FIO is believed to have the most
    expansive spy network in the entire cluster, perhaps beaten out only by the Jove
    (though since very few have seen the Jove in nearly a decade, it is hard to say).
    The agency is rumored to have operatives in all levels of foreign government:
    secretaries for megacorporation CEOs, retainers for the heirs, and even assistants
    for tribal chieftains are all said to be on the payroll of the FIO. How much of
    this is truth and how much paranoid fiction is up to debate. The federation itself
    is little help, since by policy it always disavows any knowledge of spying on
    foreign governments.\n\nOfficially, the FIO reports solely to the president and
    operates only with his blessing. However, in the time since Mentas Blaque has
    risen to power, it has acted with more and more autonomy. Some have claimed the
    Black Eagles are little more than secret police. The Black Eagles, for their part,
    say they only work to protect the federation itself. Whose vision of the federation
    that is, exactly, remains in question.\n"

- body: "## Culture and Religion\n\nThe core value that drives the federation\u2019s
    culture is that of personal liberty. This permeates every level of civilization,
    with individuals generally able to live their lives however they choose. A person
    can be of any race, religion, or creed and generally find acceptance and opportunity
    wherever he goes in the federation. The diversity this engenders has made the
    federation the most cosmopolitan of all the empires. While the other three empires
    tend more toward a macrolevel homogeneity, even a small city in the federation
    will find Gallente walking side by side with Amarr, Caldari, and Minmatar of all
    backgrounds, bloodlines, and beliefs.\n\n### Culture\nCoupled with the high standard
    of living in the federation, this great freedom allows citizens to pursue any
    life they wish. Someone who takes pleasure in the simple things can usually live
    a relaxing life with very little real hardship or stress. Those who only thrive
    in the pursuit of something can reach for their goals and, with luck and perseverance,
    achieve greatness. No dream is considered unworthy, no desire unattainable.\n\nThough
    the Gallente are innovators in many arts, one particular aspect merits mentioning
    (if for no other reason than that it serves as a convenient emblem of the Gallente
    mindset): Due in no small part to their proclivity for pushing the boundaries,
    Gallente artistry has become so elaborate that, to many members of New Eden\u2019s
    other nations, it seems virtually unintelligible.\n\nAs an example, in many Gallente
    narratives, the story is embedded within layers of satire-upon-meaning-upon-satire
    and predicated upon subtle movement and form. As a result, the whole endeavor
    of the audience becomes less about following plot and more about how to interpret
    the piece based on the nuances of its presentation. For this reason, whereas a
    typical Gallente may sit rapt over the latest Gallente holoreel, a non-Gallente
    might watch the same thing and perceive little to have happened at all. Furthermore,
    in many Gallente works these convolutions will turn in on themselves several times,
    creating meta layers of meaning that Gallente critics and academics love to mull
    over, but which seem like vacuous pretention to those less interested in the intricacies
    of analysis.\n\nVirtually every type of culture and subculture imaginable can
    be found in the federation, freely mingling. Walk down the Crystal Boulevard on
    Gallente Prime and it\u2019s likely no two people will look alike. A body modder
    who has replaced half her limbs with cybernetics can be found standing beside
    a worshiper of the Sani Sabik faith, the two of them watching an Adakul monk lead
    a troupe of gene splicers in meditative exercises. Dozens of churches dedicated
    to every religion can be seen lined up side to side, the priests engaged in friendly
    chitchat as they await parishioners.\n\n### Religion\n\nIn terms of religion,
    as in so many other domains, the Gallente exhibit tremendous diversity. New creeds
    appear and disappear regularly, usually incorporating elements of previously existing
    religions or philosophies and combining them in new ways. Secular cynics are fond
    of saying that these \u201Cdiet religions\u201D are little more than schemes intended
    to part innocent spiritual seekers from their money while bestowing tax breaks
    on the evangelists who run things. While this is certainly not unheard of, it
    is nonetheless true that in a considerable number of cases these religions are
    instituted and run by people who genuinely believe they have found \u201Cthe truth\u201D,
    until next month, that is, when a new religion comes along and changes everything.\n\nThough
    they are many and varied, the religions of Gallente origin tend to share a few
    characteristics. For one, their practices tend to be neither very strict nor formal,
    as a general rule focusing more on the individual and his happiness than on rules
    or dogmas that serve the institution. Rituals vary wildly, but tend to incorporate
    some form of herbal or chemical assistance in communing with the higher power
    in question. Most often these are legal substances, but every once in a while
    (particularly in the case of newer religions), they are synthesized psychoactive
    compounds that are still tied up in local or federal approval pipelines and have
    not yet become illegal. It is perhaps not surprising that the Amarr have an abiding
    view of Gallente religious activities as little more than drug parties, where
    religion is dressed up as an excuse for reckless hedonism.\n\nIt is difficult
    to foresee which individuals will be religious and which won\u2019t. A child growing
    up in a typical Gallente household (if there is such a thing) is almost guaranteed
    to have parents who adhere to two different religions (or secular philosophies);
    furthermore, she will, according to most accepted statistics, switch beliefs or
    denominations at least twice in her life. As Gallente society is constantly in
    flux, so too are the mental lives of most of its inhabitants; it follows, therefore,
    that as religious organizations rise and fall, so do each individual\u2019s affiliations.
    In fact, during a given Gallente citizen\u2019s lifetime, she is likely to go
    through several cycles of secularity, philosophy, and religion. How deeply felt
    any of them are can be known only by the individual in question."

- body: "## Politics\nOf course, all this freedom has its costs. The only things generally
    considered illegal are those things which do harm to others. As long as there
    is consent from all parties, however, pretty much any craving can be satisfied
    as long as a person knows where to look. While those growing up in the federation
    often learn to moderate their baser urges, there are always those who slip through
    the cracks; foreigners moving to the federation, for example, are often easily
    overwhelmed if they aren\u2019t careful.\n\nFor all its shining greatness, the
    federation does risk falling into a malaise. Nowhere is this more evident than
    in its elections, where voter turnout has been consistently declining for decades.
    While the large federal elections, particularly for the president, have respectable
    turnouts, local voter turnouts regularly reach new lows. Some believe this is
    an unavoidable side effect of the federation\u2019s greatness; if everyone is
    happy, they don\u2019t feel the need to speak up and make changes. Others believe
    it\u2019s not happiness that keeps voters away, but sheer apathy, with everyone
    too caught up in themselves to worry about who makes the laws.\n\nIt does not
    help that the diversity has created a lack of unifying purpose for many Gallente.
    While the Amarr have their religion, the Caldari have their corporate loyalties,
    and the Minmatar have their clans and tribes, there is very little tying one Gallente
    to another. There are those among the upper echelons of the federation who worry
    that when pressed, everything might easily fall apart. \n\nFrom this, an extreme
    right-wing counterculture has emerged which has found heroes in current head of
    Federal Intelligence Mentas Blaque and his shadowy team of special operatives
    known as the Black Eagles. This group is rapidly gaining influence in the federation,
    and no one yet knows how far their invisible arm will reach before all is said
    and done.\n\n### Voter Blocs\n\nThe habit of dividing the population up into broad
    blocs of voters is an\nold one in Gallente political circles, and five groups
    in particular\nhave risen to distinction.\n\n#### Hawks\n\nMost prevalent among
    the Jin-Mei and Mannar populations (though\nnaturally well represented among military
    personnel across the\nFederation), this is the ever-present fraction of those
    who advocate a\nmilitaristic stance. Maintaining this position requires an uncommon\nmindset?the
    largest group among the hawks are the pureblooded patriots\nwho believe passionately
    in the greatness of the Federation (and the\nneed to spread its influence as far
    and wide as possible).\n\nThis political leaning often brings together retired
    generals and\nentertainment moguls, since the spread of cultural influence is
    clearly\na valuable weapon. In light of yesterday's attacks, the hawks are\ncalling
    for measured consideration of the situation, with an eye to the\nsubsequent deployment
    of as much military force as is necessary to push\nthe Caldari back and, following
    that, undertake a sustainable\ncounter-attack.\n\nFoiritan had never been a friend
    to the hawks. They tend to find much\nmore in common with [Blaque](1bZzUGejHEhyHp6LVUtjBT)
    and it was with\na sigh of relief that they saw him out of office and welcomed
    the far\nmore militant Jacus Roden.\n\n#### Doves\n\nComprised mostly of Intaki
    and common among artists of all stripes, this\ngroup opposes military action in
    all but the most clearly defensive\ncases, although they're less averse to spreading
    Gallente beliefs\nthrough \"cultural warfare.\" The recent history of the Gallente
    has made\nprotesting against military action something of a challenge (there\nhaving
    been very little to protest), but the dove mindset has shown\nremarkable resilience
    over the years and still represents a relevant\npercentage of the population.\n\nThis
    group's popularity may in part be attributed to the considerable\neffort expended
    over many years by the movement's proponents to define a\nconsistent and coherent
    position without lapsing into irrelevant\nextremism. They were, of course, appalled
    by the unprovoked Caldari\nassault, but were equally appalled by calls among their
    fellow Gallente\nfor unrestrained retaliation. Most acknowledge the need to reclaim\nLuminaire,
    although with the caveat that any action should be managed as\npeacefully as possible.
    At the same time, fringe members of this group\nactually sympathize with the Caldari
    position rather more than is\npolitically fashionable at the moment.\n\nThe doves
    had always accorded well with Foiritan although they never\nfully trusted him,
    but they are going to have a hell of a time with\nPresident Roden.\n\n#### Vultures\n\nOne
    of the more predictable blocs, made up of military contractors and\nfinancial
    despots; Jin-Mei and ethnic Gallente; and others from all\nwalks of life, right
    down to individual shop workers. This group will\npounce on any opportunity to
    turn current events to their own advantage,\nusually without considering the true
    ramifications or the cost to\nothers. If there's money to be made or power to
    be gained through a\nparticular course of action, they'll lean hard on anyone
    they can\npressure until they get their way. Unsurprisingly, they're by far the\nmost
    effective lobbying community in the Federation.\n\nFor most of the vultures, the
    prospect of a full-blown war is the most\nexciting thing that's happened in the
    last fifty years, and they're\nalready figuring out exactly what needs to be done
    to extract maximum\nreturns from the situation. This is the group that is pushing
    hardest\nfor the most extreme options; indeed, some are advocating simply piling\nthe
    entire Federation Navy into Luminaire and damn the consequences.\nThey'll support
    whoever looks to be most useful to them at any\nparticular moment in time? Jacus
    Roden's militarism looks eminently\nprofitable, but they'll get behind Mentas
    Blaque in a heartbeat if he\nlooks more likely to accommodate their demands.\n\n####
    Magpies\n\nThe magpies are easily the largest and most fickle group in Gallente\npolitics.
    Though comprised of people from just about every profession\nand walk of life
    in the Federation, they are united by their short\nattention spans, a superficial
    understanding of politics, and the\nability to become suffused with theatrical
    outrage at the drop of a hat.\nTypically they form a huge mass of fragmented interest
    groups,\ndissolving and reforming in a seemingly random manner as old causes\nbecome
    stale and boring and new ones sprout. The strongest force in\nGallente politics
    occurs when a critical mass of these sybarites unite\nbehind a particular cause,
    at which point support rapidly snowballs and\nthey become nigh-unstoppable. This,
    thankfully, is a rare occurrence.\n\nThis group are still collecting themselves
    after recent shocks, but the\nsmart money says they'll throw their support behind
    some kind of\ncounter-attack. The exact form this effort might take is open to\nspeculation,
    but the retributive mood swing seems inevitable. The\npolitical and military leadership
    knows that these opinions will likely\nnot endure once casualties start to mount?but
    they also know that this\ngroup cares not one jot about which leader gets them
    what they want, so\nlong as they get it.\n\n#### Ostriches\n\nThese are likely
    the second largest bloc, encompassing a\ndisproportionate number of ethnic Gallente,
    low-paid workers, and\nhigh-flying success stories. They have no real interest
    in politics or\nevents on the federal stage. They're either happy enough with
    their lot\nor too busy to care, but the end result is the same. As many a\npolitician
    has found out to her considerable cost, however, they cannot\nsimply be ignored?
    a fair number of them vote, if only because they feel\nthey ought to, although
    typically they just vote for whomever they've\nactually heard of (or failing that,
    the one with the most interesting\nname). Woe betide any would-be leader who actually
    manages to get their\nattention by interfering with their lives; a number of aspiring\nstatesmen
    have destroyed a rival merely by insinuating to the right\npeople that the rival
    is planning to reduce worker protections, clamp\ndown on wild parties, or just
    interfere unnecessarily with peoples'\nlives.\n\nThis group's interest in the
    war extends only to muttering over\nheadlines or having expansively irrelevant
    arguments about it, and most\nindividuals in this group couldn't even tell you
    the current President's\nname which is likely seen as a good thing by all concerned.\n"

- body: "## Growing Up Gallente\n\nFor a Gallente child, the wealth of his family
    largely dictates his circumstances. To the poor, this means barely adequate health
    care and occasional infant mortality. To the rich, it means genetic alterations
    to favor certain traits and a healthy, beautiful, and fashionable child. These
    practices are not universal, but common enough for many to notice similarities
    in rich Gallente children born around the same date\u2014similarities reflecting
    which genetics were the rage at the time.\n\nAfter birth, most Gallente children
    are largely left alone with their families for the first few years of life. Parents
    are given ample government-regulated leave to spend with newborns, and common
    childcare exists to care for older children while parents are otherwise occupied.
    During these years, many children spend much of their time engaged in playtime
    activities designed to promote individual thinking and perhaps, in better programs
    at least, to identify any aptitudes or interests. The poor fare worse here, though
    even they can often depend on at least some governmental aid.\n\nSchooling in
    the federation is public and free, though quality varies widely between schools
    serving different social strata. In poorer (and more rowdy) worlds and districts,
    it is not uncommon for education to be handled entirely through technological
    means, with human teachers few and far between. At the other end of the spectrum,
    many private institutions exist for specialized education for those who can afford
    it. Children focus in areas where they excel, but get grounding in other areas
    as well. Educational theory cycles in and out of fashion like everything else
    in the federation. One class of students might be encouraged to design their own
    lessons and set their own schedules, while another might have more traditional
    uniforms and set curriculums. Regardless of setting, though, every Gallente child
    is taught the benefits of freedom within the Gallente system, and it is a rare
    Gallente who doesn\u2019t at least know the basic rights and government structure
    of the federation.\n\nOnce a Gallente student graduates from elementary and intermediate
    education, most attend a university or academy. There are thousands of such institutions
    in the federation. Some are run by member states while others operate privately.
    Here again, the rich often enroll their children in expensive and very prestigious
    institutions, though in many cases a few scholarships exist at these schools for
    talented students of lesser means. The vast majority of students attend government
    schools or a variety of moderately priced private colleges. Even the destitute
    enroll in a basic program at a local community training center.\n\nCompleting
    education at a university or academy takes from two to six years, depending on
    the program. During this time, students not only work toward future careers but
    often become involved in political and social groups. Students are encouraged
    to experiment and find the right lifestyle and career path for them. This time
    is considered the most important formative period for Gallente youth, as this
    is where the skewed playing field of their upbringing begins to level and they
    begin to find their aptitudes and discover the wealth of opportunity at their
    fingertips.\n\nThey are also encouraged to socialize. Gallente view proper socialization
    as an art, a skill, and an absolute necessity. The rich and most elite students
    join secret or at least private societies, while most other students join a variety
    of fraternities, sororities, political groups, and organized social circles whose
    power and influence will end up being largely dictated by the cleverness and adaptability
    of their members. Many friendships and connections formed during this time will
    last a Gallente through his entire life.\n\nUpon completion of advanced education,
    Gallente are considered by society at large to be full adults, though most were
    at the age of majority before attending a university. Many join corporations or
    government agencies in entry-level jobs. Some also become freelancers or emigrate
    to jobs in one of the other empires. A few unfortunates find they cannot secure
    quality employment, and these students join the ranks of poor laborers at the
    bottom rungs of Gallente society, if not the jobless and disenfranchised. This
    is also where those individuals end up who for whatever reason could not complete
    their education. Various aid programs exist to help these individuals, but many
    Gallente adhere to the idea that the poor are where they belong as a direct result
    of their own choices and lack of drive. After all, as a Gallente, you are free
    to be anything you want.\n"

- body: "## Bloodlines\n\nThe Gallente are not alone in their Federation, whose boundaries
    are home to pockets of residents varying in size and representing all the other
    races of New Eden, most of whom left their own empires due to political or ideological
    differences, or simply in search of peace and prosperity. In addition to the natural
    born Gallente there are two races, the [Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn) and the
    [Mannar](4BaMCkOwYaPpd4ZMtEfEY), both of whom the Gallente found while exploring
    and expanding their empire. Both were at a very primitive level when the Gallente
    found them, but since coming under their protection and guidance, both have flourished
    and are now full-fledged members of the Federation.\n\nThe [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy)
    were initially part of the Federation\nbut deep-seated differences and mutual
    animosity between them and the Gallente drove them out to found their own empire.
    For a time the two empires warred against each other, but as neither could gain
    sufficient advantage to claim victory, peace was settled in the end.  \n\n###
    Gallente\n\nEpitomizing the federation named after them, the [Gallente](3V8a3iCXmTydxJIORMLTtM)
    are liberal and freedom-loving explorers with a tendency toward hedonism and excess.
    Though they are the most numerous single ethnicity in the federation, they are
    by no means the majority. Gallente can be considered friendly, accepting, and
    diplomatic almost to a fault, willing to tolerate things in their fellow man that
    would be considered completely taboo in other cultures. Of course, this also means
    the Gallente are a cultural force unrivaled in the cluster, exporting their beliefs
    to the other empires and slowly winning them over, influencing them toward a more
    Gallente ideal by virtue of the immense personal freedoms afforded.\n\nThere are
    many, however, who would claim that this tolerance is little more than a thin
    veneer masking an insidious element of cultural superiority, and they wouldn\u2019t
    be entirely wrong. To the average Gallente, after all, it is considered a matter
    well beyond discussion that the federation and its way of life are superior to
    the other civilizations of New Eden. If people disagree, so be it, but the Gallente
    know in their bones that truth is truth, and debating it is pointless. Instead
    of alienating would-be members of the fold with arguments, they prefer to sit
    back and let their cultural and commercial indoctrination do the work for them\u2014something
    which it rarely fails to do.\n\n### Intaki\n\nThe second most populous minority
    in the federation behind the Gallente, the [Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn) are
    a deeply spiritual people. Hailing from the lush planet of Intaki Prime, they
    are known as great communicators and diplomats. The Intaki are calm and collected,
    rarely given to outbursts of emotion. This reserved nature has served them well,
    and they have retained much of their cultural integrity even in the face of overwhelming
    pressure from the Gallente.\n\nOne of their most unifying traits is a system of
    belief known as Ida. Not truly a religion, Ida teaches that there are exceptional
    individuals who have lived many lives and can tap into the memories of these past
    lives. Most of these so-called Reborn explore their past lives via specialized
    technology, while a special few, known as the Idama, are able to recall them naturally.
    The advent of cloning technology has only helped reinforce these beliefs among
    many Intaki, who maintain that being cloned represents the next step on the spiritual
    path.\n\n### Jin-Mei\n\nHaving only recently begun spreading from their home systems,
    the [Jin-Mei](6SFvK45QIlCCCoNODY3gUB) are unusual compared to the other bloodlines
    in the federation. Their most notable feature is their continued adherence to
    a caste system which many Gallente view as quaint at best, outdated and dangerously
    regressive at worst. The Jin-Mei, however, seem happy with it, and there has been
    little political pressure for them to change their ways.\n\nThe Sang Do (meaning
    \u201Clord\u201D) caste sits at the top of the system. They are traditionally
    the rulers of the Jin-Mei and they have managed to retain their power, even as
    the Jin-Mei transitioned to a democratic system. The Saan Go (meaning \u201Cstanding
    high\u201D) are the middle caste, most often serving as government officials or
    wealthy businessmen. Though they defer to the Sang Do, their greater numbers and
    mercantile endeavors have given them greater influence outside of their home system
    than within. Finally, the Jing Ko (meaning \u201Cgood spirit\u201D) sit at the
    bottom, though in this case that\u2019s not as bad as it may sound. The Jing Ko
    are generally more affluent and carefree than the group they are most often compared
    to, Amarr commoners.\n\n### Mannar\nWith a reputation for being headstrong and
    stubborn, the [Mannar](4BaMCkOwYaPpd4ZMtEfEY) are one of the oldest members of
    the Federation. The Mannar are both notorious for their fervent nationalism and
    appreciated for their contributions to the Federation, not least the large numbers
    serving in the federal military.\n\n### Other Bloodlines\n\nThe federation has
    tremendous ethnic diversity. In addition to the previously mentioned bloodlines,
    the Mannar are also one of the core ethnicities in the federation. However, they
    have not yet taken to the capsule in great numbers and thus haven\u2019t had much
    of an impact on the interstellar scene. Overall, however, they are renowned as
    hardworking, genial, and family-oriented men and women who are a bit more conservative
    than the rest of the federation.\n\nThere are also a large number of [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp)
    within the federation. It is estimated nearly one-fifth of all Minmatar live within
    the federation, though that number has dwindled in recent years as the republic
    has undergone something of a cultural and economic revival. Many Minmatar originally
    left the republic to escape poverty and crime, coming to the federation to make
    better lives for themselves and their families. Many still hold on to that dream
    while maintaining their tribal beliefs and customs, with the result that giant
    enclaves of Minmatar reside within the federation, sometimes rivaling Gallente
    cities in size.\n\nA number of Caldari also live in the federation, mostly descendants
    of those who remained on Caldari Prime after the evacuation during the First Gallente-Caldari
    War. Unlike the Minmatar living in the Federation, those Caldari who are there
    have typically taken on Gallente culture as their own. There are even Amarr who
    have come to the federation. Some arrived as missionaries, dedicated to spreading
    the word of their god peacefully to the Gallente. Others came for the opposite
    reason, wishing to escape the all-encompassing religious indoctrination of the
    empire."

    has been called into question over the years, none could argue that his style

    been involved in the day-to-day operations of his corporation, which made it a
    national surprise when he came out of retirement to challenge then-president Souro
    Foiritan\u2019s attempt to nationalize the federation\u2019s military-industrial
    complex. When Foiritan later resigned as president, Roden announced his own candidacy
    for the office, surprising the nation even further.\n\nRoden won on the back of
    an intense campaign, and so far his presidency has proven quite successful. Under
    his leadership the federation turned the tide of the Empyrean War and liberated
    Caldari Prime from the grip of Tibus Heth\u2019s Provists. However, rumors claim
    he and Mentas Blaque stand at odds over how to move the federation forward, with
    some insisting Blaque holds the real power.\n\n### Mentas Blaque\n\nOne of the
    most wily and ruthless men in the federation, Mentas Blaque has been active in
    the halls of power for decades. He burst onto the national stage in his late thirties,
    being elected to the Senate from his home district in Solitude. As part of the
    Sociocrat Party, he espoused an isolationist policy that put him at odds with
    the popular sentiment of the day. Through intelligence, charisma, and political
    savvy, however, he managed to achieve the office of head senator, where he would
    find himself frequently clashing with President Souro Foiritan.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful
    bid at the presidency, Blaque remained a political thorn in Foiritan\u2019s side.
    He pushed for the federation to be aggressive with its enemies, ruthless with
    traitors, and suspicious of foreigners. Much of his advice was ignored, a fact
    which backfired badly on the federation when the Caldari managed to circumvent
    constellational security systems and capture Caldari Prime in a lightning attack.\n\nIn
    response, Foiritan tapped his old rival to head up the Federal Intelligence Office.
    Blaque immediately formed the Special Department of Internal Investigations and
    Federal Security, known more popularly as the Black Eagles, and had them entrusted
    with wide-ranging powers to root out traitors and conspirators against the federation.
    While many have hailed the Black Eagles for keeping the federation safe, others
    have criticized it as little more than a secretive cabal which doesn\u2019t mind
    stamping on the freedom and privacy of its citizens to achieve its own ends.\n\n###
    Souro Foiritan\n\nHailing from Intaki, Souro Foiritan was one of the most beloved
    presidents in federation history until his tragic downfall in late YC 111. Originally
    a senator for the popular Progressive Party, Foiritan was well known for his oratory
    and charisma. One of the great diplomats of the federation, he worked with the
    Amarr Empire, the Minmatar Republic, and the Caldari State to maintain peace and
    prosperity in the cluster of New Eden. It was no great surprise when he was elected
    Federation President.\n\nHowever, as his term neared an end, he set into motion
    changes to the law which allowed him a second term. This led to numerous delays
    in the election, as opponents challenged the legality of the change, knowing his
    popularity would all but guarantee him a victory. Though he eventually won the
    election over rival Mentas Blaque by a healthy margin, it was the first of many
    black marks on his presidency.\n\nA series of further mistakes followed. He attempted
    diplomacy and appeasement with the hostile Caldari leader Tibus Heth, leading
    to the disastrous One-Day War, which saw the loss of Caldari Prime to the state.
    Then the State Protectorate captured all disputed territory in the Empyrean War.
    In response Foiritan attempted to nationalize the federation\u2019s military-industrial
    corporations, but, under the leadership of Jacus Roden, they uniformly refused
    his executive order. Seeing public confidence in him bottoming out, Foiritan resigned
    his presidency in disgrace.\n\nDespite having stepped down, Foiritan remains a
    dormant political force. Thus far he has kept more or less quiet, but many prognosticators
    assume he is merely biding his time before reemerging into the political limelight."

description: "Gallente Federation Perhaps the most controversial of all the empires,
  the Gallente Federation is many different things\u2014depending on who you ask.
  To their supporters, they are the largest and most enduring democracy in New Eden
  and a bastion for equality and justice. To their detractors, they are velvetgloved
  imperialist bullies, incapable of truly acknowledging any culture other than their
