- body: 'The **Holy Star** is an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) torture device. It
    is

    made of a transparent, glass-like material, is roughly the size of an

    adult man, and looks like a five-armed starfish. The device, like the

    [Sin Eater](794wlFxb2YGdWeorXlrw9P), is a favorite of Amarr torturer

    priest [Vitor Dranera](3KDpilEZ7Q2EdkIumRKMus), who employs it in what

    he thinks of as his pest control problem.


    Usage

    -----


    It is covered in highly reflective barbs. When not powered, the barbs do

    no harm. When activated, the device slowly sucks away the body of

    anything attached. It appears to start with blood, then moves onto the

    hair and feathers, before finishing with flesh and bone. Once complete,

    the victim has been sucked away into nothing.
