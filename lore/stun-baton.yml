- body: 'The **stun baton** is a larger, heavier version of the

    [Z-Stick](3rLFUehxOmRFeRSeigjt5c) that delivers a crippling shock when

    placed into contact with human skin. Unlike the Z, the effects last long

    after physical contact with the device ceases. It can penetrate light

    clothing, but is ineffective against body armor. The stun baton also

    doubles as a blunt trauma delivery weapon.
