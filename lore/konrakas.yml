    [Shintaht](6hdH1UnLE6P8A7ckIJqUzG) system, near [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)

    space. The planet has an extremely chaotic climate, with seasons ranging

    from scorchingly hot to icily cold. Ocean tides are dramatic and floods

    are common, winds frequently reach hurricane speeds, and gravitational

    forces cause constant earthquakes and volcano eruptions. The planet is

    completely lifeless. However, the natural forces constantly force rare,

    valuable minerals to the surface, making it a mineral heaven. The same

    forces make it difficult to mine, so it has yet to be colonized for

    mining.
