- body: "**Gallente Prime**, or sometimes just \"Luminaire\", is the sixth planet
    in the Luminaire system, and is the original home of the [ethnic Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK).
    It is home to the magnificent city of [Caille](73TXaac6RTgSJaqJHkTxCz), and its
    [crystalline central boulevard](45ZcfxzqF7v2mqmLksGxYU). Despite being home to
    the Gallente race, it is not the *de jure* capital of the Federation - that role
    belonging to Villore.\n\nGallente Prime is an ethnically mixed society, being
    the cultural capital of the Federation and an economic powerhouse. It is a fairly
    hospitable world: the Gallente recovered technologically far faster than their
    combative neighbors, the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy).\n\nHistory\n-----------------------------\n\n###
    Settlement and Collapse\n\nThe Planet was originally settled by French settlers
    from Tau Ceti, who give the modern-day [ethnic Gallente](3V8a3iCXmTydxJIORMLTtM)
    their ideals of liberty and equality in a democratic state. \n\nAfter the [EVE
    Gate](2z1KQXUVtPP1WmlwcJaX4o) collapsed, the Gallente fared better than most other
    colonies, largely due to the habitable, non-hostile of nature of Gallente Prime.
    Other colonies such as [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i) had not been fully
    terraformed, and thus resorted to reverse-engineering the terraforming equipment
    that had been abandoned at the collapse of society in the cluster.\n\n### The
    First Gallente-Caldari War\n\nThe war between the Gallente and the Caldari initially
    revolved around the system of Luminaire, which was the home of Gallente Prime
    and Caldari Prime. As the closest planet to Caldari Prime and, at the time, home
    to a large proportion of the infrastructure of the [Federation Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1)
    and its support agencies, when the schism occurred between the Caldari and the
    rest of the Federation, Gallente Prime was both a staging ground for the Federation
    Navy and a target for the Caldari.\n\nAlthough the Federation won the battle for
    Luminaire, capturing Caldari Prime and forcing the Caldari back into their newly
    claimed territories, it was not without great losses on the surface of Gallente
    Prime. When the Caldari decided to pull back from the Luminaire system and evacuate
    the populace of Caldari Prime, their month-long campaign of distractions against
    the Federation to draw attention away from their home planet would result in Admiral
    [Yakiya Tovil-Toba](RsUoECrk1bkV0t35D4sDE) taking the *Kairiola* \u2013 a water
    freighter hull that forms the basis of the modern Chimera carrier \u2013 into
    the atmosphere, breaking up and hitting several key locations on Gallente Prime,
    doubtless killing thousands of people. The scheme succeeded and Caldari Prime
    was successfully evacuated with the relocation of the populace to the New Caldari
    system. This left the entire Luminaire system under Federal control for nearly
    two hundred years.\n\nNotable Locations\n-----------------\n\n### Caille\nWhile
    no longer the government seat of the Gallente, Caille is the economic and cultural
    capital of Gallente Prime. It is the birthplace of the [University of Caille](3yrFWFSjOxnFu1GTFhudTM),
    \ one of the most respected schools in New Eden. It is also the home of the famous
    Crystal Boulevard, a street full of crystalline buildings where nearly anything
    can be bought and sold; it rests atop a pavement of thick synthetic diamond that
    protects a secure government bunker.\n\n### Hueromont\n\nThe ship of Yakia Tovil-Toba
    plummeted primarily into this city; its destruction became a rallying cry of the
    Gallente war effort. In the modern day there is a New [Hueromont](1PzpjLA0ZHtQRZu2f8x4gO).\n\nCurrent
    Status\n--------------\n\n### Events of 110.06\n\nThe ominous prospect of the
    glassing of the most revered planet in the Federation has cast a shadow over the
    world since June of [YC 110](4s7KrRaqQANTatQhzlSaRi), when the entire [Caldari
    Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN) was ordered to retake the Gallente-occupied Caldari
    homeworld of Caldari Prime by [Tibus Heth](6E1MZyo3l7DscBmmOdp7KG).  A Caldari
    Navy Leviathan with an escort fleet was left in orbit of Caldari Prime with orders
    to glass Gallente districts on Caldari Prime and then the entirety of Gallente
    Prime should the Federation launch military assaults on any Caldari targets as
    retribution.\n\n### Host to execution\n\nIn the aftermath of the Caldari invasion,
    Gallente Prime was the host to the execution of former Grand Admiral [Anvent Eturrer](4ft267N4XjELE5by1uHCt5).
    The even was held in a specific open arena that was specially adapted for the
    execution. It could hold millions of people and possessed towers that held vid-screens.\n\nSee
