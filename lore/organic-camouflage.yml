- body: '**Organic camouflage** may be used not only to disguise humans, but

    actual places and locations. Not only that, but they can be deployed in

    conjunction with other, hidden systems for access control.


    For instance, there exists a form of hidden passageway that may be

    passed through only by specific individuals. Passing through it is

    described as entering a porous membrane that melds with you and ripples

    and moves to let you through. It should be noted that the passageway''s

    disguise is purely chameolonic, and not a hologram.
