    Sabin. She is a cousin of [Aritcio Kor-Azor](2puF18pxR6b7AVuy3HE9IV), \nand his
    confirmed successor as\nKor-Azor [Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh).\n\nLife\n----\n\nShe
    grew up at the [Kor-Azor Family](1S0FEGgzJiwc4yXaG5AzjD) court,\nand Ersilia's
    uncle Doriam, later to be Emperor Doriam II, personally\noversaw her education,
    wanting her to receive the same instruction as\nhis son Aritcio. Soon Ersilia
    proved herself a keener intellect and\nbetter student than Aritcio, whose envy
    led him to persecute her. Well\neducated in loyalty to the Family and to its precepts,
    Ersilia endured\nAritcio's rivalry and outright scorn for years, until in her
    twenties\nshe asked her uncle Doriam for permission to leave the court and serve\nthe
    House elsewhere. Although free to express her true potential when\nthis request
    was granted, she had effectively removed herself from\nDoriam's immediate circle.
    In later years, Ersilia appears to have\nbelieved Doriam might have seen in her
    a better successor than Aritcio\nif she had stayed.\n\nWorking in the outer reaches
    of House Kor-Azor's business and diplomatic\nsphere, she became a renowned negotiator,
    and a proud, resilient person.\nShe is polite and calm, seldom lighthearted even
    in private, and gives\nthe impression of a rather serious, somewhat humorless
    character.\nHowever she is never cruel, even while taking tough decisions, and
    is\ngenerally considered a godly person and good leader.\n\nEven with her qualities,
    she became widely notorious while she was\nworking on secondment to the [Ministry
    of Assessment](79mGvIq3LHSJ3KiUPcd46v)\nduring the [Girani-Fa incident](2UHBIYTHWxi6ePMtEEAOZw).
    As the head negotiator for the\nAmarr Empire, she proposed the involvement of
    [Quafe](ssPYMESgTyz1rl4fTojD6)\nas a means to break the dangerous deadlock over
    the Girani-Fa system.\nHer consequent fame and increased standing brought Aritcio's
    envious\nattention on her again. He was able to convince his father to arrange\nher
    marriage for political gain to a powerful Holder ruling the capital\nplanet of
    the Nimedaz constellation. While the marriage actually gave\nErsilia considerable
    influence over a major planetary holding, the\noverall effect was isolating and
    constituted a defining moment that\nrobbed her of many opportunities she had previously
    earned. By his\nmeddling, Aritcio made an enemy of her for life. In reaction to
    her\nisolation, Ersilia started to pursue fame and power to one end only: to\nbe
    her uncle Doriam's preferred successor.\n\nBefore the [Succession Trials](3yGFKyRmrZRaTtTGOLkRzU)\nthat
    made him Emperor, Doriam chose Aritcio to succeed him, and Ersilia\nbegan planning
    to depose and kill her cousin. After Doriam's death, she\nhad to rush her plans:
    the new Succession Trials might have been called\nat any time, and she couldn't
    risk Aritcio becoming Emperor. Ersilia had\nbecome convinced that the erratic
    Aritcio was a madman and all Amarr\nwould suffer greatly under his rule. Moreover,
    it was almost certain\nthat she would be summoned to be part of the [Emperor Family](IXrotYvoWOVnuGAMbbYEv)\nif
    Aritcio ascended the throne.\n\nAritcio's rule as Royal Heir of House Kor-Azor
    had been so capricious\nthat serious unrest had developed. Ersilia began to covertly
    support\naggrieved Holders within the Kor-Azor territories, even going so far
    as\nto secretly aid those opposing Aritcio during the Liparer II crisis\n, hoping
    that it would weaken Aritcio's grasp on power. In the\nevent, other factions within
    the Kor-Azor Holders called on the Speakers\nof Truth and when [Brother Joshua](3GdUiafeRMQKdpzDb8CWnJ)
    of that\norder became involved matters developed otherwise .\n\nDuring Aritcio's
    convalescence she worked hard to stabilize the region,\nand before he fully recovered
    from his punishment, she had done much to\nmake her name and deeds known. When
    her cousin came back to public life,\nhe unexpectedly thanked her for her work
    more than once, increasing her\nfame within the Kor-Azor holdings and across the
    Amarr Empire.\n\nCooperation with Aritcio\n------------------------\n\nNever truly
    believing in Aritcio's redemption, Ersilia was careful to\ncultivate her personal
    power and influence in the Kor-Azor family during\nEmpress Jamyl's reign. In this
    regard, Ersilia finally received direct\nand tangible gains from her arranged
    marriage upon the death of her\nhusband, inheriting control of his personal holdings
    in YC112. She was\nsurprised when, just before his appointment as\n[Imperial Chancellor](7GOV3morIu47J3BmidrhU8),
    Aritcio asked her to be his\npersonal advisor on the affairs of House Kor-Azor.
    Suspicious beyond\nreason but intrigued she accepted, with the plan of enforcing
    her power\nand potentially fining a way to oust Aritcio. She never truly abandoned\nthis
    intention, but working closely with Aritcio she witnessed that he\nhad really
    changed, though her concern was that this change was\nultimately a result of deep
    and intricate psychological trauma.\n\nRoyal Heir-elect\n----------------\n\nAfter
    Jamyl's death, Aritcio declared at a Kor-Azor family council that\nhe was ready
    to withstand the Trials of Succession, and that he had\nchosen Ersilia to be his
    successor. He made clear that her resolve to\nrule was no smaller than her ability
    to do so, and she would be a\nperfect Royal Heir for the Kor-Azor. While somewhat
    baffled, Ersilia\naccepted and the family confirmed her as Royal Heir-elect ahead
    of the\ntrials for the Imperial Succession YC118."
