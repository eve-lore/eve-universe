    amount of pleasure from describing the various methods to captives.

    Vitor, who is described as a wizened old man, has overseen the torture

    of several [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) secret agents who attempted

    to infiltrate the Empire. He appears to be in charge of his facility, as

    he threatened a technician and used one prisoner to see why his

    equipment was being escaped. Two instruments he favors are the [Sin Eater](794wlFxb2YGdWeorXlrw9P)
    and the [Holy Star](5O5B2bkCF6R0eO3ZkumPCz).
