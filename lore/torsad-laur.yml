    features a mud-brick terminal surrounded by pray-drones, beggars, and

    narrow cobblestone streets. It is said to be the only slave-inhabited

    quarter where the gentry can walk at night without being attacked and

    where one could even have a conversation with a slave. The district is

    nicknamed ''The Cauldron'' for its mix of smells from the merchant stalls

    in Izoni Square. The merchants here sell hand-made cutlery, bootleg

    [holosymphs](3wMNl4r8nlqV8iK1tAdSWc), off-world condiments of varying

    legality, [scriptual terp mods](6TIpQ8lAsM2isnRlh4xHqZ), [Adakul manuals](1nYy5VaKr9UPOwT8IRjxNY),
    designer-knock-off

    [Caille](73TXaac6RTgSJaqJHkTxCz) leathers, and virtually every creature of

    [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) prepared for consumption.
