    [Tibus Heth''s](6E1MZyo3l7DscBmmOdp7KG) vastly more successful revolt of a similar
    nature- after 65,000 protesters were killed by Caldari paramilitary forces while
    trying to force their way onto a [CEP](5OC2T1uqCSy4NUPhhpq9Xr) station in the
    New Caldari system. After months of dogged pursuit by Caldari authorities, the
    riots were put down and most of the leaders were killed or arrested.


    Some of the leadership, including the ringleader [Melarius Torvil](77Fm8H3rm3bSlyTrcZ5YOK),
    did manage to escape the final [Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN) operation
    that crushed the Brothers'' movement. Torvil and a small group of associates fled
    to the [Minmatar Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) and applied for asylum from
    Caldari persecution, which was granted by [Prime Minister Midular''s](3KxlNVAeglPj5ZH0sf3U2j)
    [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK)-friendly government.


    Today, though they have been largely eliminated as a major force in the State,
    the Brothers of Freedom continue to spread anti-corporate propaganda and speak
    out against the CEP''s government in the Gallente Federation and the Minmatar
    Nation, as well as outlying State settlements and facilities.
