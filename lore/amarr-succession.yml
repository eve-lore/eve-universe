- body: 'The **Amarr Succession** is a series of rituals to select an [Amarr Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ)
    after the previous emperor dies.


    The rituals occur in a strict order and take a few weeks to complete.

    Their exact, specific nature is unknown, only that they mainly involve

    various ways the [Amarr Heirs](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) prove their

    loyalty and worth to lead the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo).


    Most of the rituals involve the Heirs directly, though in recent times

    they have allowed for the naming of individual champions. The selection

    of proper champions has come to be seen as an essential part of the

    trials.


    Following the selection of a new Emperor, the other four challengers

    must commit [ritual suicide](7uCmeRGL3bgVWlEWQ9TZQb) in order to

    minimize the risk of challenges to the Emperor''s authority from the old

    Privy Council. This ritual suicide has been

    broken twice, once by [Khanid II](5HlA8KgFOuLy4jTf3t54xf) following the

    selection of [Heideran VII](4Olxc4nxWd7y1mjFPhvHnV) and once in YC105 by [Jamyl
    Sarum](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L).
