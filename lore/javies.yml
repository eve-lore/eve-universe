- body: '**Javies** is the personal manservant of [Bethora](5wsvjWAtEn3fgbxYCq7eG3).

    He is apparently a very competent employee, having served Bethora for

    decades.


    Because of his long years of service, he is occasionally allowed some

    leeway in his personal behavior. Javies is noted as being extremely

    fastidious. He travels with Bethora on all official trips, and is

    notable for his willingness to undertake duties younger men blanch at.


    During Bethora''s stay at an orbital station (where she was attending the

    race her [son](7bRDME40tMpJRpS2MtG1NC) participated in), he constantly cleaned

    whenever they were on board, as he thought the station staff did an

    inadequate job.
