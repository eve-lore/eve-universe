- body: "March, YC111\n============\n\nBefore Seyllin\n--------------\n\nMarch YC111
    was to be\ndominated by one event and its aftermath above all others: the\n[Seyllin](1SX3stmn3UJS4nAXLNeUsG)
    Disaster. In itself, what happened in\nSeyllin was one catastrophic effect of
    a much more profound and\nwidespread phenomenon: the emergence of unstable wormholes
    across the\n[New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) cluster. The long-term effects\nof
    that emergence can only be guessed at but it was Seyllin, with its\nalmost inconceivable
    human tragedy, that gripped New Eden before the\nwider impact of the events of
    that day began to be comprehended.\n\nBefore Seyllin, however, the month began
    with the affairs of the empires\nplaying out much as they had done in previous
    weeks. In the [Minmatar Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp), continued pressures
    in the troubled\npolity led to charges of political stasis being leveled at\n[Sanmatar](180IYq6xQy0PzfGH6hLEuO)
    [Maleatu Shakor](3H5EVyO9kiyIUOEELIqOlV) amid chaotic and fractious scenes in\nthe
    [Republic Parliament](2EcbNQu5ua4Jjt3TTM0CvW). An attempted\namendment on a financial
    motion that attacked the Sanmatar's assumption\nof powers was heavily defeated
    by a majority of the members present but\nserved as an indication of increasing
    disquiet at the uncertain\npolitical situation.\n\nThe Sanmatar may have felt
    that his call soon after for an Assembly of\nthe Seven Tribes of Minmatar answered
    any such charges as had been aired\nduring the turbulent parliamentary session.
    This was swiftly followed by\na stunning political development as the Sanmatar
    and\n[Thukker](3uoxvtJY1Z30BoVwuJLj2z) Chief Einnar Aeboul were able to\njointly
    announce that the Thukker Tribe, long estranged from the other\ntribes, was to
    join the Minmatar Republic with full autonomy in the\n[Great Wildlands](great-wildlands).
    An emotional\nMaleatu Shakor was able to declare that \"the Seven Tribes of Matar
    are\nonce more unified.\" The details of this union and the changing political\nstructure
    of the Minmatar Republic, now being spoken of as a \"Tribal\nRepublic,\" were
    clearly to be major agenda items of the Tribal Assembly\nthat Shakor had called
    for only days before.\n\nIn the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK),\n[Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn)
    Senator Suvio Bellaron proposed a ban on\npublic executions following the [Eturrer](4ft267N4XjELE5by1uHCt5)\nexecution.
    Senator Bellaron condemned the execution as \"a shameful and\nbarbaric spectacle\"
    when introducing his bill. Others criticized\nBellaron and noted the scale of
    Eturrer's treason. The bill was\neffectively killed through procedural devices.
    In [Black Rise](black-rise) region, scene of intense warfare between\nthe Gallente
    Federation and [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy), the\n[Kaalakiota Corporation](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK)
    announced a\nlarge-scale surveying program aimed at locating resources and potential\ncolonization
    sites in the region. This was soon followed by\nannouncements from [Lai Dai](5k5GiWRlFceyTjLSz71XT)\nfor
    development in Black Rise and clear positioning by\n[Wiyrkomi](66psXtrftjRzA7MyKHtb7K)
    and\n[Sukuuvestaa](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB) for future Black Rise\nprojects.\n\nIn
    the [Ammatar Mandate](4BV4ldw5RdVB4FxKctn4J6), Grand Admiral\nEinkur Aro, former
    head of the [Ammatar](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz) Fleet,\npleaded guilty to charges
    of dereliction of duty and treason and was\nsentenced to death by a panel of [Theology
    Council](38uUjWk3RiR80FqDwjmQWk) Justices headed by [Royal Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh)
    [Yonis Ardishapur](4Tb1Uk75SycuFuiizODkZD). In addition, Admiral Aro's\nfamily
    was ordered to be enslaved. There was some protest at the\nseverity of the sentence
    but Einkur Aro himself remained impassive and\nthere was order as he was led from
    the courtroom to await execution a\nweek later.\n\n111.03.10 - The Seyllin Disaster
    and Emergence of unstable wormholes\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n###
    First Indications\n\n The first indications that anything\nunusual might happen
    on 111.03.10 were a series of communications\ndisruptions early in the day. First
    there came a report of travel delays\nin Seyllin system, Essence region caused
    by the disruption of the\nsystem's \"[Cassandra](47YuBR3HlvNeGKVgVupGVx)\" solar
    weather monitoring\nnetwork. Shortly after this, contact was lost with an\n[ORE](38pEfgwJxyeFUuqMgpTLZ)
    survey expedition in 3HQC-6\nsystem in [Outer Ring](76XHDOSsVTEcKoz8b0QuNt) region.
    Of course, nobody\nconnected the two incidents, happening as they did so far apart
    and\noccasional disruptions of the kind were hardly unknown. An entire planet\ndropping
    out of contact was, on the other hand, rather unusual and when\nthe [FTL link](slULqrFiu06fLmeraX1QL)
    with the planet\nof [Seyllin I](rcmhOIWig0zQ49j4fNF7m) and the rest of the [Gallente
    Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) was inexplicably lost it caused real\nconcern.\n\nWith
    planetary FTL [fluid routers](4w6FgQepyWkx0g0zXZctHM) typically\nbeing among the
    most secure and hardened of installations - and Seyllin\nI's were reported to
    be located several kilometers beneath the surface\nof the planet - the sudden
    loss of contact seemed mysterious and\nworrying enough for Gallente President
    [Souro Foiritan](37ecuyyUNrWqNAzxwC5Wbt) to order the mobilization of\nso-called
    [\"Tripwire\"](YZKlsxmTbVhuLskRwPmlL) defenses across the border separating the\nFederation
    from the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy). Justified as a\n\"precautionary\"
    measure, the mobilization nevertheless triggered a\nresponse in kind from the
    Caldari, as their forces adopted a heightened\ndefensive posture along the border.
    Within the hour, Caldari State\nExecutor [Tibus Heth](6E1MZyo3l7DscBmmOdp7KG)
    had issued a statement in\nwhich he said that the Caldari deployment was purely
    in response to the\nactivation of Gallente border forces and denied the presence
    of any\nCaldari forces in the vicinity of Seyllin.\n\n### Solar Pulse\n\nWhen
    communications with Seyllin I were restored a half-hour later all\nemergency channels
    immediately flooded with planetary distress calls.\nWith distress signals originating
    from all four primary cities of the\nplanet \\- Loadcore, Metal City, Southern
    Cross and Valimor \\- it became\nclear that planetary communications systems had
    restarted autonomously\nfollowing a protective shutdown against an external threat.
    With the\ncities of the barren mining planet all located underground, speculation\nas
    to the nature of the threat was widespread and only fueled by\ncontinuing distress
    calls, many calling for evacuation of the planet.\nSpeculation turned to alarm
    when an automated distress signal from a\nground-level installation on Seyllin
    I indicated a possible nuclear\nattack underway. With [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt)
    and Federation\nwarships scrambling for the system, authorities called for calm
    and\nrefused to confirm that an attack had been launched, noting that the\nearly-warning
    system could be triggered by other environmental events\naside from a nuclear
    strike. \nHowever,\nfurther distress signals from Seyllin indicated that many
    injuries\nconsistent with exposure high levels of radiation were being reported.\nThe
    first messages received were determined to have originated from the\ndaytime side
    of Seyllin I near the city of Loadcore, although\ncommunications with the day
    side of the planet were reportedly being\nrouted through underground links to
    the night side. Direct\ncommunications with day-side cities and installations
    remained massively\ndisrupted and effectively impossible. With radiation burns
    and poisoning\ncontinuing to be reported it became clear that a radiological event
    had\ntaken place and the fear that a nuclear attack had been carried out\ncontinued
    to grow.\n\nThese fears were allayed somewhat when scientists at a hastily-arranged\nemergency
    conference in Bourynes declared that a \"solar radiological\npulse\" originating
    from the powerful blue sun of Seyllin system was the\ncause of the catastrophe.
    The [University of Caille](3yrFWFSjOxnFu1GTFhudTM) conference further ruled out\nany
    kind of military attack or nuclear strike, noting that no weapons\navailable to
    any state in the cluster could have delivered almost\ninstantaneous planetary-wide
    devastation reaching into the deep\nsubterranean cities of Seyllin I. While this
    may have been regarded as\ngood news by some, the scientists were not sanguine
    about the chances\nfor survival of anyone caught on the surface of the planet,
    and even\nmore ominously were unable to rule out the possibility that the Seyllin\nsun
    had gone nova. Even though the O-class star would not have been\nexpected to enter
    the post-main sequence period for another million\nyears, the evidence was that
    the planet had been doused in massive\nbursts of ultraviolet light and high-energy
    particles consistent with a\nnova or similar solar event.\n\nWhile events at Seyllin
    were ongoing, [the Scope](2XUuFn5Lte67YYxmxj86Yt)\nreported that a [Thukker](3uoxvtJY1Z30BoVwuJLj2z)
    Great Caravan had\nbeen reported missing in the Great Wildlands region after passing\nthrough
    the SL-YBS system. For one of the vast, hundreds-of-ships-strong\nGreat Caravans
    to simply disappear was so unusual that the Thukker were\nreported to be urgently
    consulting with the Minmatar Republic's Sanmatar\nMaleatu Shakor. Additionally,
    Outer Rings Excavations confirmed that\ntheir deep-core survey expedition operating
    in 3HQC-6 system had been\nlost. Most significantly, the team had been working
    on the first planet\nof the system and reported a \"possible nuclear strike or
    other\nradiological pulse weapon\" detonation near their location shortly before\nall
    contact with them was lost. The similarities with the Seyllin event\nwere lost
    on no-one and ORE immediately began sharing data with the\nscientists at Bourynes.\n\n###
    Panic Spreads\n\nAs panic began to spread around the Gallente Federation - one
    serious\nincident being a stampede at the Oursulaert III [Federation Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1)
    Testing Facilities station - the\nfirst Federation and CONCORD warships arrives
    in orbit around Seyllin I.\nThey were met by a scene of devastation and CONCORD
    officials confirmed\nthat a \"natural disaster of unprecedented scale and consequence
    had\noccurred.\" The Federation Navy announced it was bringing in\n[dropship](4wZzQQw2pCVTwh0vgiWEv8)
    squadrons for evacuation of the wounded\nby carrier, and that many other capital
    ships and freighters were en\nroute bringing supplies and intending to operate
    as orbital triage\ncenters. \n\nShortly after the\narrival of the warships at
    Seyllin, President Souro Foiritan and CONCORD\nChief of Staff Kivas Odaka held
    a joint news conference confirming that\na radiological pulse had emanated from
    the sun of Seyllin system and\nimpacted on Seyllin I. The statement confirmed
    that the \"Cassandra\"\nweather monitoring system had gone offline at 08:41\n[EST](2cJeP2eBHll85PfjQlTtHt),
    followed by the shutdown of fluid\nrouters across Seyllin I at 08:49 EST, apparently
    as the pulse struck\nthe planet. At 08:59 EST, communications with the city of
    Southern Cross\nwere restored and it had been determined that the pulse had disabled
    the\nplanetary communications network, incapacitated the global power grid\nand
    destroyed or heavily damaged any equipment on or below the surface\nof the planet
    to a depth of 20 meters.\n\nImportantly, President Foiritan emphasized that the
    pulse was not an\nattack by any nation and appeared to be a singular solar event
    with an\nunknown cause. Given the high level of damage, he had issued an\nexecutive
    order to evacuate Seyllin I and had appointed Grand Admiral\nAnteson Ranchel to
    oversee the operation. CONCORD forces would be\nassisting in the evacuation and
    that dropships would be ferrying\nevacuees from the night-side cities of Southern
    Cross and Valimor. The\ncities of Loadcore and Metal City would not be directly
    evacuated and\ncitizens were advised to use magrail lines operating on backup
    power to\nreach the night-side cities.\n\nAs the magnitude of the events in Seyllin
    became understood, together\nwith a few indications that the solar radiological
    pulse was by no means\nan isolated occurrence, so did panic rise across New Eden.
    In the\nGallente Federation, increasing numbers of crowd panic incidents were\nreported
    and the stock markets began to fluctuate. In particular, the\nstock prices of
    the Gallente mining sector tumbled as the impact of the\nloss of Seyllin I, a
    major Federation mining planet, began to be felt.\nIn the Caldari State, many
    citizens in colonies along the border with\nthe Federation began to take to emergency
    shelters on the outskirts of\ncities and other settlements. Fear of war with the
    Federation appeared\nto be the main reason for the flight to the shelters and
    the authorities\nin some colonies were reported to be overwhelmed by the sheer
    numbers of\npeople flooding in.\n\n### Situation Worsens\n\nWhile the wider reaction
    appeared to become more hysterical, the\nsituation on Seyllin I lurched into chaos
    despite the presence of many\nfreighters and capital vessels operating as medical
    triage centers and\nsupport ship for squadrons of dropships. The rush of Seyllin
    I's\ninhabitants to get off the devastated world soon resulted in tragedy as\ntwo
    overloaded Federation Navy dropships collided on take-off, killing\nall aboard
    and many in the waiting crowds of refugees. An estimated\n4,000 were killed in
    this disaster and Federation Marines were quick to\nmove in and place cordons
    around all loading bays to establish order and\nprevent further overloading of
    dropships. The desperation of the crowds\nonly intensified as distress signals
    and footage of the horrors of\nSeyllin I, particularly from the day-side cities,
    were received and\nre-transmitted in their hundreds across the planet and beyond.\n\nDespite
    the extraordinary news of\nthe [Serpentis Corporation](64u7D7YksvODwmCFL3llMs),
    despite\nits longstanding enmity with the Federation, sending medical equipment\nand
    personnel to Seyllin, alongside specialized excavation and rescue\nequipment from
    ORE, the overall situation appeared to worsen by the\nminute. When the Scope obtained
    and transmitted a feed of President\nFoiritan imploring the people of Metal City
    and Loadcore to use the\nmagrail system to move to safety, rather than wait to
    be rescued, it\nbecame clear that the effort to evacuate some half a billion inhabitants\nfrom
    the planet was becoming increasingly desperate.\n\nIn response to the crisis the
    Gallente charity Renyn Relief, itself\nbased in Essence region, announced an emergency
    aid response for Seyllin\nI. The charity dispatched all its available vessels
    to Seyllin, with\nseveral freighters laden with medicine and other supplies sent
    on their\nway to the stricken planet. Elsewhere in New Eden a rather less\ncharitable
    response to the tragic events of Seyllin came from the Amarr\nEmpire when a fundamentalist
    groups, the God's Righteousness Conclave,\ntransmitted a statement calling the
    solar event \"God's cleansing fire.\"\nClaiming the disaster to be foretold by
    scripture, the Conclave claimed\nit was the consequence of \"heresy\" and a \"vengeance\"
    on the Gallente\nFederation, described as \"the heretic nation.\"\n\n### Evidence
    of Wider Events\n\nLate in the morning by standard time, more evidence of the
    wider and\nmore profound nature of the events of the day came to light as an\n[Intaki
    Syndicate](4ODncOn9Yvcol1oPLyHrFk) Bureau station orbiting at\n16AUs from the
    sun of the 35-RK9 system was struck by a radiological\npulse. This was the third
    confirmed solar event of the type to occur\nthat morning. Fortunately, the considerable
    distance of the station from\nthe sun appeared to result in the pulse hitting
    the station much less\nstrongly and the shields were reported to have held, despite
    many\nelectrical and electronic systems being knocked out. As this news was\nbeing
    digested, the Scope broke a story that CONCORD probes\ninvestigating the Seyllin
    sun had disappeared and had apparently been\ndestroyed on approach to the star.
    The DED was reported as having\ndetained the journalist breaking the story and
    CONCORD itself refused to\ndiscuss the story or confirm the detention of the reporter.\n\nDespite
    the clear and\nincreasing evidence that Seyllin had been the site of an extraordinary\nyet
    naturally-occurring event that was not even isolated, anti-Caldari\ndemonstrations
    began to flare up across the Federation. Even the\nstatements of President Foiritan
    had not been enough to allay fears and\ndispell suspicions among many that the
    Caldari had struck at the\nFederation using a diabolical new weapon. Perhaps mindful
    that his words\nwould not be enough, as well as requiring more ships to relieve
    Seyllin,\nPresident Foiritan soon recalled the Federation Navy ships deployed\nalong
    the border with the Caldari State. The Caldari, for their part,\nmade no immediate
    move to mirror this action.\n\nIn a sign of the increasing tendency to blame any
    unusual occurrence on\nthe mysterious but deadly new phenomena apparently afflicting
    stars\nacross the cluster, an [Amarr Navy](3PKvXZS0iHKIgAmO9np74g) report that\ncontact
    had been lost with one of their scout patrols in the border\nsystem of Kourmonen
    caused some consternation. The local Navy commander\nplaced his fleet on high
    alert and this in turn triggered a matched\nresponse from [Republic Fleet](2c4ZwKPnuW6mYkLJ2dGh94)
    vessels in\nneighboring Auga. However, within the hour contact with the patrol
    had\nbeen re-established and the ships recovered with no loss and seemingly\nhaving
    suffered nothing akin to the radiological pulses reported\nelsewhere in New Eden.
    No hostile action by other nations or military\nforces was evident on the Amarr-Minmatar
    border but both sides remained\nat high alert following the incident.\n\n### \"They're
    Dead Already\"\n\nOn Seyllin I, the situation continued to deteriorate. Shortly
    after noon\nEST, the magrail link between Loadcore and Southern Cross failed,\ntrapping
    thousands of refugees in transit deep underground and making\nthe job of evacuating
    Loadcore vastly more difficult. Rescue teams on\nSeyllin I described the situation
    as \"hell\" and it was reported that\nmany rescuers were receiving high doses
    of radiation while working on\nthe planet. Radiation poisoning was the subject
    of a leaked radio\ncommunication by a Federation disaster relief official. The
    official was\nheard saying \"they're dead already, they just don't know it\" in\nreference
    to survivors from the day side of the planet showing signs of\nreceiving high
    doses of radiation. The grim prospect of the evacuation\nof people doomed to die
    anyway transfixed news audiences across New\nEden.\n\nIn the Minmatar Republic
    the disappearance of a Great Caravan - later\nrevealed to be the important Lakat-Hro
    caravan - took precedence over\nall. Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor announced that the
    the ability of the\nRepublic to respond to the Seyllin disaster was minimal while
    [Republic Fleet](2c4ZwKPnuW6mYkLJ2dGh94) assets were diverted to the search for\nthe
    missing Great Caravan. Coordinating the effort to find the caravan\nlast known
    to be in SL-YBS system, the Trust Partners corporation\norganized a huge effort
    by Republic and Thukker ships to quarter a large\nvolume of space centered on
    the last checkpoint made by the Lakat-Hro\ncaravan. Many more Republic squadrons
    were sent to this effort as the\nMinmatar focused on recovering their Thukker
    brethren.\n\nElsewhere, with the Empress perhaps\nconcerned that the religious
    radicals of the God's Righteousness\nConclave not be seen to speak for Amarr,
    the office of [Imperial Chancellor](7GOV3morIu47J3BmidrhU8) [Aritcio Kor-Azor](2puF18pxR6b7AVuy3HE9IV)
    issued a communique offering\nassistance to the Gallente Federation at the order
    of Empress [Jamyl I](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L). While the communique stated that
    natural\nphenomena are the work of God, it took the line that the Seyllin event\nwas
    a \"test of faith\" rather than a divine punishment, as the Conclave\nhad asserted.
    In a rather pungent twist, the fleet recently removed from\nRoyal Heir [Uriam
    Kador's](7LJKelrqDXAAUYi6o48Uno) control - a fleet\nthat had invaded the Gallente
    Federation less than six months before -\nwas placed on 30 minute's notice to
    provide assistance should President\nFoiritan request it.\n\nOn the planet of
    Villore VII, anti-Caldari protestors were dispersed by\nlocal police as they turned
    to throwing stones at the Caldari consulate.\nThe police used tear gas and sonic
    grenades to disperse the rioters\nbefore the situation got out of control. Authorities
    assured the\ncitizenry that the Seyllin events were not attributable to the Caldari\nState
    and peace was swiftly restored. Notwithstanding the anti-Caldari\nflareups in
    the Federation, Caldari State Executor Tibus Heth finally\nresponded to the withdrawal
    of Federation warships from the border by\nstanding down the [Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN)
    from its\nheightened defensive posture. The Caldari State also repeated an offer\nof
    assistance to the Federation.\n\nThe Federation Stock Exchange in Luminaire ceased
    trading until further\nnotice in the afternoon as it became clear that the turbulence
    of the\nmorning trading session would continue without intervention. Meanwhile,\nthe
    Gallente Federation's emergency infrastructure braced itself for a\nsevere overload
    as refugees from Seyllin I began to be shipped away from\nthe planet and out of
    system. The biggest concern amongst disaster\nmanagement officials was the very
    large numbers of people suffering from\nvarying degrees of irradiation. Concerns
    grew that, if the proportions\nof radiation poisoning seen among the relatively
    few evacuated thus far\nheld true for the entire population, existing stockpiles
    of radiation\ntreatment drugs would be totally inadequate.\n\n### Zero Hour\n\nUnfortunately,
    all concerns over coping with half a billion evacuees\nwere eclipsed by news of
    a \"large, superheated mass' heading towards\nSeyllin I. The shocking story also
    revealed that CONCORD were tracking\nthe mass and had established a \"Zero Hour\",
    or time of impact, by which\nall ships were under orders to have left the vicinity
    of the planet. the\nScope broke this news despite attempts by CONCORD to suppress
    the facts\nand the detention of several of the news agency's staff. The news that
    a\npotentially world-shattering plasma wave was approaching the planet sent\nSeyllin
    I into a mass panic. Some spaceports were forced to cease\nhandling dropships
    as bordering gantries were overrun and in some cases\ncollapsed as hysterical
    crowds fought for space aboard transports off\nthe planet. CONCORD condemned the
    Scope for publishing the new and\ncalled Chief Editor Lars Kiormen's report \"impetuous,
    inflammatory and\nirresponsible.\" \n\nDespite the panic amongst many residents,
    several journalists trapped on\nSeyllin reported that in the deepest city caverns
    an eerie calm had\ndescended. Many citizens had apparently resigned themselves
    to their\nfate and decided to spend their last moments alive in peace, enjoying\nthe
    company of their loved ones. With news agencies broadcasting\nemotional farewell
    messages to their staff and continuing to carry\nreports of an oncoming plasma
    wave, CONCORD and the Federation Navy\nceased to co-operate with journalists.
    The approximate count of Seyllin\nI residents safely evacuated by this time, early
    afternoon EST, was\n843,000.\n\nWith scientists openly speculating on the nature
    of the superheated mass\nrushing towards Seyllin I, with most concluding that
    a vast plasma wave\nhad been unleashed from the system sun, the desperation on
    the planet\nincreased. It was reported that Federation Marines had opened fire
    on\ncrowds attempting to rush dropships at the spaceports remaining open and\nable
    to service evacuation transports. Outrage was provoked by the\nevacuation of convicted
    prisoners off the planet while millions upon\nmillions of innocent citizens remained
    below. The withdrawal of\nstarships from Seyllin I orbit began, with medical vessels
    and triage\ncenters moving off. Roden Shipyards and CreoDron announced that they
    had\nhardened the defenses of their stations in Seyllin but would remain open\nfor
    new docking for as long as possible. With it noted that full\ndefensive measures
    would require the stations to seal and deny all\ntraffic, CONCORD and the Federation
    Navy declined to comment on the\nsafety of the stations.\n\nBy 14:30 EST, it was
    clear that a mass exodus of ships away from the\norbit of Seyllin I and out of
    the system was underway. the Scope\nreported that its news-gathering vessels were
    fired on by Federation\nNavy warships as they attempted to defy system-wide evacuation
    orders.\nThese ships left the system under duress but were able to report that\nall
    dropships had left Seyllin I and the planetary evacuation had\neffectively ended.
    Blockades of entry points into Seyllin from the\nadjacent systems of Aporulie,
    Ane and Metserel were put in place by\nlarge formations of CONCORD ships. \"Zero
    Hour\" had arrived.\n\n### Seyllin Lost\n\nShortly after 14:35 EST, all\ncontact
    with Seyllin system was lost as the stargates leading into the\nsystem were shutdown.
    Fluid router signals out of the system were\ninterrupted and all automated distress
    signals from Seyllin I abruptly\nceased. In the face of this terrible silence
    a dreadful realization\ndawned across New Eden.\n\nWith the blockade of Seyllin
    being maintained by CONCORD as a\nprecaution, other developments across the cluster
    came to the fore.\nSanmatar Maleatu Shakor had announced the destruction of the
    Thukker\nGreat Caravan Lakat-Hro and confirmed that a \"solar event similar in\nscale
    and power to that described in Seyllin\" had been the cause of\nthe loss. This
    announcement had brought the number of near-simultaneous\nmain-sequence solar
    anomalies occurring that day to four. This evidence\nof a cluster-wide phenomenon
    underway only stoked the already heightened\npopular fear of an armageddon-scale
    catastrophe afflicting all of New\nEden.\n\nTo the repugnance of many, the God's
    Righteousness Conclave had issued a\nfresh statement warning of dire consequences
    for those assisting the\npopulation of Seyllin I. The Conclave claimed that \"those
    lost in the\nSeyllin system shall serve as a stark reminder of both the glory
    and\npower of God.\" The Amarr government refused to comment on the statement\nand
    referred all reporters to the official position of the Empress and\nthe offer
    of support made by the Empire to the Federation.\n\n### Wormhole Warning\n\nOf
    more profound importance was the warning issued by the Servant\n[Sisters of EVE](2eTQAT2DL0C7TWVtkOr8pN)
    that they had detected signs\nof unstable wormhole formation throughout the New
    Eden cluster. The\nSisters claimed that \"multiple instances of defect-mediated
    turbulence\nin the fabric of spacetime had been detected in various locations\nthroughout
    the cluster,\" and went on to note that the sightings\ncoincided with \"the erratic
    behavior of multiple star systems ...\nall throughout New Eden.\"\n\nIn layman's
    terms, the reclusive humanitarian and scientific\norganization was saying that
    they were forecasting the formation of many\nwormholes across New Eden and that
    this formation appeared to coincide\nwith stellar events such as those witness
    in Seyllin and at least three\nother systems that day. That the Sisters referred
    to many \"unreported\"\nevents of that type caused some consternation but the
    Sisters addressed\nthe dangers of the wormholes themselves, calling on CONCORD
    to issue\ntravel warnings to avoid such wormholes. With their expertise in the\nfield,
    based on many decades of research into the [EVE Gate](2z1KQXUVtPP1WmlwcJaX4o)
    and related matters, the Servant Sisters were\ntaken very seriously indeed.\n\n###
    Aftermath of Seyllin\n\nShortly after 15:30 EST, the CONCORD and Federation forces
    guarding\nSeyllin entry gates lifted the blockade while warning ships not to\napproach
    Seyllin I itself. Within minutes, after confirmation by probes\nof the status
    of Seyllin I, Gallente President Souro Foiritan addressed\nthe Federation and
    announced the total loss of the planet due toa main\nsequence anomaly affecting
    the system's sun. With only a million or so\ninhabitants evacuated from the planet,
    the President announced the death\nof a half billion on Seyllin I with its effective
    destruction as a\nstable body. Foiritan accepted responsibility for the decision
    to\nwithhold information during the evacuation and confirmed that the order\nto
    detain reporters had been his own. Chief Editor Lars Kiormen was said\nto be released,
    but has not been seen since.\n\nthe Scope soon established a live feed of the
    remnants of Seyllin I. The\nscene showed clearly that a plasma wave had passed
    through the area and\nshowed the planet's remains slowly coalescing back into
    a sphere.\nMassive fragments and ejecta were seen in orbit around the center of\ngravity
    and capsuleers were noted inspecting the remains of the dead\nworld, despite CONCORD
    warnings of the extreme danger.\n\nCONCORD also warned of the dangers of wormholes
    after confirming for\nitself that the \"topological space-time defects\" predicted
    by the\nSisters of EVE were indeed wormholes appearing across the New Eden\ncluster.
    While technically \"unstable\", in that these wormholes appeared\nto be short-lived
    and subject to mass transfer effects, these \"tunnels\"\nthrough space-time were
    reported to be sufficiently stable structurally\nto enable vessels to traverse
    them. CONCORD declared itself unable to\nprotect those entering such portals and
    announced an \"unenforceable\ntravel ban\" to discourage pilots from exploring
    the wormholes.\n\n### The Scramble for W-Space\n\nIt soon became clear that the
    \"ban\" would do little to dissuade would-be\nexplorers. [CreoDron](3lCriaLYr0Nrmj9pkru5Z3)
    announced their discovery of\na wormhole in an undisclosed system. The corporation's
    lead\nastrophysicist, [Lianda Burreau](4YD4PXslOcnv8rY7av4vn2), announced\nher
    opinion that a \"stable wormhole\" had been found by CreoDron in a\nsystem that
    remained undisclosed. Professor Burreau refuted the CONCORD\nadvisory and ban,
    making clear that she intended to travel through this\nnew wormhole after having
    scouted the transit with long-range autonomous\ndrones. The CreoDron announcement
    prompted CONCORD to restate its\nwarnings and emphasized that all exploring such
    wormholes took such an\n\"extreme risk\" solely on their own responsibility.\n\nThe
    CreoDron scout\ndrones sent through the apparently stable wormhole were soon\ntransmitting
    telemetry back to the Prof. Burreau's team, including image\ndata. The images
    showed a system with dark, empty planets set against a\nbackground dominated by
    an unfamiliar and darkly crimson nebula.\nEncouraged by the apparently normal
    orbital dynamics of the system, and\nsetting aside indications of abnormal electromagnetic
    fields, Prof.\nBurreau maintained that she would be leading a manned excursion
    into the\nunknown system.\n\nReactions to the CreoDron discovery and plans were
    immediate and\nvarious. The deep space explorer Julien Sirrok warned that the
    CreoDron\nexpedition was taking a serious risk by relying on scout drone telemetry\nto
    guide exploration of a new region of space. The [School of Applied Knowledge](1mpxZ1xQASwfKEIiB65lDW)
    urged CreoDron to\ntreat its discoveries as the collective property of all humanity.
    This\nappeal was regarded by many commentators as naive, while others regarded\nit
    with some cynicism given that a Caldari institution was making such\nan appeal.
    Corporations such as Chemal Tech and Roden Shipyards,\nmeanwhile, began to make
    plans and allocate resources aimed at\nreplicating CreoDron's discovery.\n\nReligious
    and spiritual reactions to the wormhole discoveries were no\nless varied than
    the materialistic. The\n[Sebiestor](1fNour0sFTIcCFRVQM2pro) spiritual leader [Vuld
    Haupt](1clrLuFFV50EpAEzxYx6Zt)\nannounced that he would be organizing an expedition
    to explore the\nnewly-emerging wormholes, describing them as the \"paths of our\nancestors.\"
    The announcement prompted immediate comparisons with the\nill-fated \"Bright Star\"
    spiritual expedition of\n[YC110](4s7KrRaqQANTatQhzlSaRi). In the Amarr Empire,
    [Sani Sabik](TDJbDXVg3cRp4b6FEkkFS) cults openly revealed themselves on\nstations
    and in cities in reaction to the apparent discovery of a new\ncrimson nebula,
    interpreting it as a \"cloud of blood\" detailed in an\napocalyptic Sani Sabik
    prophecy. The Amarr [Ministry of Internal Order](5P4c9Lcr1rAUNd2Lb8gb3t) acted
    swiftly to remove\nthe cultists, described as \"troublesome elements,\" from the
    streets of\nthe Empire.\n\n### A Lost Civilization\n\nIf the initial data from
    CreoDron's scout drones was unusual, their\nsubsequent discoveries were nothing
    less than startling. When CreoDron's\ndrones identified \"non-natural deadspace
    signatures\" in the unknown\nsystem on the other side of the wormhole discovered
    by Lianda Burreau's\nteam, the professor had lost no time in publicizing the news
    via the\nBalrille constellation's liquid router network.\n\nThe news appeared
    to\ngalvanize New Eden's various empires and factions with the Sisters of\nEVE,
    Amarr Navy and the Lai Dai Corporation all announcing plans to\nmount expeditions
    into \"W-Space\", as the realm that many of the\nwormholes appeared to lead to
    became known. The population of the\nGallente Federation were by now in a state
    of collective shock, stunned\nby the Seyllin Disaster and its aftermath, and transfixed
    by the\ndiscoveries being made about and within the newly-emerged wormholes.\n\nThe
    Federation authorities, however, took a highly precautionary line,\nno doubt heeding
    CONCORD with whom they had been working hand-in-glove\nthroughout the day. Late
    evening reports had [Federation Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1) reserves seizing
    control of the secret\nCreoDron site somewhere in the Balrille constellation.
    This was\napparently an attempt to forestall the Burreau expedition into the\nBalrille
    wormhole but the intrepid professor had left some time before\nthe Navy's forces
    were able to lockdown the CreoDron facilities.\n\nUpon hearing the news of the
    Federation Navy's actions, the [University of Caille](3yrFWFSjOxnFu1GTFhudTM)
    expressed their shock and\noutrage at the seizure of CreoDron's facilities. Through
    its press\noffice, the University declared that the Navy's actions threatened
    \"the\nvery foundation of our scientific research.\" University of Caille\nscientists
    and other academics had been heavily involved with the day's\nevents concerning
    the \"Seyllin Pulse\" and were concerned that the Navy's\nstep would damage attempts
    to understand the possibly linked phenomena\nthat had been observed.\n\nLate that
    night, the Federation Navy let it be known that all its\nattempts to contact the
    Burreau expedition had failed. They also\nrevealed that contact with the scout
    drones that had preceded the\nexpedition had been lost as well. The Navy made
    no indication that it\nintended to send a party into the wormhole in search of
    Professor\nBurreau and her expedition team. With little more emerging and the
    Navy\nbeing reticent on the subject, many assumed that the Burreau expedition\nhad
    met a grim fate and was lost somewhere in W-Space. The School of\nApplied Knowledge
    declared that \"despite the possible tragedy, the\nexploration can continue and
    in fact, it must do so.\" The\nindications from across New Eden, as planning an
    preparation for more\nexploration continued, were that governments, corporations
    and academic\ninstitutions were very broadly in agreement on that point.\n\nThe
    Burreau expedition proved to be the final drama of a very long day.\nA day that
    could be claimed to rival even the cluster-shaking 110.06.10\nfor momentous impact
    and which may, in the final analysis, turn out to\nhave even more far-reaching
    implications for the future of the cluster.\nCertainly, by any measure, 111.03.10
    had surely established itself as a\nhistoric day that would long be remembered
    in New Eden.\n\nAfter 111.03.10\n---------------\n\n### W-Space exploration\n\nShocking
    as the Seyllin Disaster was, the sensational news that the new\nwormholes were
    potential routes to another realm, containing traces of\nan ancient civilization,
    seemed to push the catastrophe on the Gallente\nplanet into the background. Certainly,
    some\n[capsuleers](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) went to Seyllin to try and assist\nwith
    what remained of the evacuation of refugees from Seyllin's stations\nand those
    ships that had remained in the system. Others went simply to\ntake a look at the
    shattered planet, marveling at the destruction\nwrought by the superheated plasma
    burst that had radiated out from\nSeyllin's sun.\n\nFar more capsuleers acted
    as many non-capsuleer organizations did and\nbegan to explore the potential of
    wormholes. As reports and rumours of\nmore and more expeditions to wormholes dominated
    the news feeds, it was\nonly within a few days that the first reported capsuleer
    starbase was\ndeployed in a W-Space system. (By now, the parlance \"W-Space\"
    for\nwormhole space and \"K-space\" for known space had become current and\naccepted.)
    As this was being reported, the Thukker caravans were said to\nbe taking the lead
    in the Minmatar's wormhole exploration efforts. The\nexpertise of the Thukker
    as explorers, and perhaps their wish to see\nthat the Lakat-Hro caravan had not
    been lost in vain, made them the\nnatural choice to spearhead Minmatar efforts
    in this area.\n\n### Jarek's Pride\n\nWhile the aftermath of Seyllin and the emergence
    of the wormholes\ndominated March, events elsewhere continued. In the Minmatar
    Republic,\nthe Salvation Crusade was once more the focus of attention as [Abel
    Jarek](5HDj1enu8OW6rTNg6d9dR8) confessed to the \"sin of pride\" concerning\nthe
    chapel built by his followers on Matar and subsequently burned down\nby rioters.
    The charismatic leader of the Salvation Crusade revealed\nthat he had meditated
    on the destruction of the chapel and concluded\nthat he was \"not yet worthy to
    build a house for our Lord.\"\n\nStill dogged by demonstrators and opposition
    among the general\npopulation, the slave-based Amarr faith movement had also apparently\nbeen
    the cause of difficulties with the Minmatar government for Aidonis\nMedical, a
    charitable branch of the [Aidonis foundation](2ZdUwi6lEN75YZoamvXA72). The medical
    charity claimed that\nit had been placed under \"insidious pressure\" to withdraw
    humanitarian\naid workers from the Salvation Crusade compound in the largest Matar\nrefugee
    camp. Tensions between Aidonis Medical and the Minmatar\ngovernment had already
    arisen over the handling of the humanitarian\nsituation in the refugee camps.
    The case of Dr. Arturio Kiervalani, a\nvolunteer medic with Aidonis Medical who
    had spoken about the\nanti-Salvation Crusade rioting, also exacerbated matters.
    The revocation\nof his license to practice medicine in the Republic was seen by
    the\ncharity as part of the \"pressure\" claimed to be under. For its part, the\nRepublic
    government denied the claims and refused to comment on the\nKiervalani case.\n\nTo
    the surprise of some, the next declaration by Abel Jarek was that he\nintended
    to found a permanent community in Matar's remote Tronhadar\nvalley region. He
    consequently took over half of his followers,\nincluding all the children and
    elderly among them, to the Tronhadar\nwhere he founded the township of \"Salvation\"
    in the \"unclaimed hills\" of\nthe lower Tronhadar. The move caused considerable
    disquiet among the\n[Krusual Tribe](7KI9OEieV9sdjksayCyoGk), with its ancestral
    holdings\nin the mountains of the upper Tronhadar abutting the area where Jarek\nestablished
    his \"community of believers.\" Even though many of the\n\"crusaders\" remained
    in the camps to preach and carry on the work of\nconversion among refugees, those
    who had protested against Jarek and his\nfollowers claimed that the controversial
    preacher had been driven to\n\"flee into the hills.\"\n\n### Ardishapur and the
    Mandate\n\nIn the troubled Ammatar Mandate, Royal Heir Yonis Ardishapur continued\nto
    set his seal on the imperial province by appointing a new chief of\nthe [Ammatar
    Fleet](3as0Qu7kajUNvkjJdBSwF1). Elevating Admiral Hastar\nJibril of the [House
    Ardishapur](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO) forces to\nGrand Admiral of the Ammatar Fleet,
    the Royal Heir also set about\nintegrating units of his family's fleet into the
    Ammatar forces. The\nheavy losses suffered by the Ammatar Fleet during the Elder
    Invasion, as\nwell as the desertions that followed, were to be made up in this
    way.\nThis also neatly allowed Yonis Ardishapur to comply with the reactivated\nedict
    of [Heideran VII](4Olxc4nxWd7y1mjFPhvHnV) banning personal fleets\nwhile retaining
    control over a very large space navy.\n\nGrand Admiral Hastar promptly set about
    implementing the merger of the\ntwo forces and also issued a swathe of promotions
    across the Ammatar\nFleet, replacing many lost officers and NCOs while maintaining
    a balance\nwithin the fleet by promoting a large number of Ammatar servicemen.
    In a\nrelated matter, the family of the executed former Grand Admiral of the\nAmmatar
    Fleet, Einkur Aro, was purchased by Arim Ardishapur, nephew and\nHeir-apparent
    to Yonis Ardishapur, to serve as \"favored\" household\nslaves.\n\n### The Fall
    of Intaki\n\n The ongoing war between the\nCaldari State and the Gallente Federation
    in the Black Rise region and\nsurrounding areas continued despite the tragedy
    of Seyllin. The Caldari\n[State Protectorate](2VlyV0CDyxFv0Qg3N3dW8k) militia
    had made\nadvances in the Placid region and soon threatened to occupy the Intaki\nsystem.
    The Federal Navy called on the Gallente [Federal Defense Union](5RoHHUZd3JdAg1HhBi5BAP)
    militia to make incursions into\nthe Inolari constellation in Black Rise as part
    of \"Operation Justice's\nReach,\" an apparent effort to recover military equipment
    suspected to\nhave been stolen by Caldari forces in a raid on shipping in Caslemon.\nThe
    Caldari Navy dismissed this campaign as a \"smokescreen\" and indeed\nneither
    FDU nor State Protectorate forces seemed inclined to take much\nnote of the call,
    preferring to concentrate on the offensive underway in\nPlacid.\n\nWhether due
    to the Federation Navy's lack of focus, the FDU's\ndisorganization or the State
    Protectorate's single-minded efforts, the\nIntaki system duly fell under Caldari
    occupation. With a major\nFederation race's home system now under the control
    of the Caldari\nState, a significant blow had been dealt to the Gallente. The
    occupation\nof the system by Caldari forces led to much disruption on Intaki Prime,\nwith
    outbreaks of violence reported on the planet as pro-Federation,\npro-State and
    Intaki secessionist demonstrators took to the streets. The\nensuing clashes led
    to over a dozen deaths and hundreds injured. While\nIntaki Prime remained under
    the control of its planetary government,\nconsiderable confusion as to the intentions
    of the Caldari manifested\nitself in concerns that a blockade, extended siege
    or even a full-scale\ninvasion might take place. The Intaki government made appeals
    for calm\nand the well-respected Sadereron Idama, an Intaki spiritual leader,\nurged
    Intaki citizens to keep to their homes.\n\nWhile a major Federation system fell
    under Caldari occupation, the\nFederal Intelligence Office internal security and
    counter-espionage\ndivision known as the \"[Black Eagles](6eVk3icIk4UHf5Uh799xDN)\"
    raided\nthe offices of the Renyn Relief charity, based in the Essence region\nsystem
    of Renyn. With the raids taking in the charity's offices in\nwar-torn Placid and
    the charity having been founded by a Caldari\nprospector, Gaido Noreitta, with
    links to Outer Ring Excavations, it\nseemed to some that the Federation's internal
    security force was placing\norganizations run by expatriates under special scrutiny.\n"
