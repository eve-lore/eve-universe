    developed such that, as of YC122, there are 6 regions, comprising 54 constellations,
    covering a total of 388 systems.\n\nThe federal democratic geography of the Federation
    is expressed at the highest level of division by 62 Federal Districts, which are
    in turn split into 903 sub-districts or \"subs\", based on population and in-system
    geography.\n\nTypically, Gallente Federal Districts are organized such that each
    district is co-terminous with a Federation constellation. A district is divided
    into sub-districts that generally range in geographical division from the size
    of single planets to the size of systems.\n\nHowever, due to population densities
    being particularly high in certain constellations and on certain planets there
    are exceptions to this general rule. Six constellations have been split into two
    districts, while the heavily populated Crux constellation comprises three districts.\n\nThese
    seven exceptional multi-district constellations are split into 15 districts, with
    the remaining 47 constellations making up the total of 62 districts across the
    entire Federation. Luminaire itself is the sole single-system district of the
    Gallente Federation and several of its planets contain numerous sub-districts.
    \n\nCertain other districts with heavily populated planets feature several sub-districts
    on one planet, with Intaki and Lirsautton systems being notable examples.\n\n##

    \n\nFederal Senators are elected on the basis of sub-districts, with the subs
    functioning for this purpose as single-seat senatorial constituencies.\n\nFederation
    Districts also have representation through District Parliaments. Additionally,
    districts and sub-districts are often used as the basis for organizing local legislative
    assemblies and other representative bodies.\n\nA structure of executive governors
    is also in place primarily for the purpose of running star system level administrations,
    co-operating through constellation and regional councils of governors. It is not
    unknown for governors to clash with district and sub-district parliaments and
    assemblies.\n\n### See Also\n\n- [Democracy in the Gallente Federation](50Q1BNUHpwZCZBn7VqBL18)\n-
