    Graveyards\nThis ship graveyard marks the site of perhaps the boldest\u2014or
    barbaric\u2014military feat in the recorded history of EVE. It was here where
    CONCORD, the protectorate of interstellar travel, was attacked preemptively by
    a Minmatar Elder armada. With the Thukker Tribe fighting at their side, the Minmatars
    fought with a fury not seen since the Rebellion, even sacrificing their own ships
    to accomplish their mission. With CONCORD\u2019s rapid-reaction force incapacitated,
    the Elders then launched an invasion of Amarr space and freed untold numbers of
    slaves.\n"
