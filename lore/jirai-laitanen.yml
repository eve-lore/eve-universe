    member of the [Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN) [37th (Octopus) Squadron](6NdtjEBsqU8oCs1sTDR5pP)
    and later went on to found

    the notorious pirate group the [Guristas](55L861YhB1ZfaAST6ZbhdO) with

    [Korako Kosakami](3Mb6UfjhKf0MdSbbR4a2EU) - "The Rabbit".


    Caldari Career

    --------------


    Laitanen was a shrewd and gifted captain, with a glib tongue and

    charismatic smile. Many expected him to reach a position of authority in

    the end. But he was also vain and greedy; traits that led to his

    eventual desertion. Kosakami was much more introvert than his friend

    Laitanen, but he had a brilliant mind and was a technical wizard.


    Formation of the Guristas

    -------------------------


    A decade ago, Laitanen was passed over for promotion and Kosakami was

    blamed for a lethal crash landing, all within the space of one week.They

    stole a couple of Condor-class frigates,

    the same they still use today, and set off to a pirate-infested sector

    between [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) and

    [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) space, deserting from the Caldari Navy

    and eventually founding the Guristas - an amalgamation of two Caldari

    words meaning ''naughty people'' and also a slang term for ''gang''.


    Kidnapping

    ----------


    At some point in their career, Fatal and the Rabbit masterminded and

    carried out a kidnapping of the Gallente Federation ambassador in the

    Caldari State - [Luecin Rileau](2d24moamL2NaimjLpHTENT). This has

    granted them great fame.


    Apparent Demise

    ---------------


    During an engagement with capsuleers, Fatal was podkilled. Due to an

    inferior clone, he reawoke with memory loss and was later apparently

    ousted from the Guristas. His current whereabouts and situation are

    unknown.
