    imperial state ruled by the [Amarr Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ). It is both
    the oldest and the largest of the empires of New Eden. This vast theocratic society
    is supported by a broad foundation of slave labor, mostly drawn from people of
    Minmatar extraction, but also from several other nationalities subdued by the
    empire throughout its long history. Their home planet in the Amarr star system
    was named Athra in ancient times, but was renamed [Amarr Prime](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4)
    during the expansion into space.\n\nAs a culture, Amarr adheres to the basic tenet
    that what others call slavery is in fact only one step on an indentured person\u2019s
    spiritual path toward fully embracing the Amarr faith. Amarr citizens tend to
    be fervent and industrious individuals, deeply convinced from an early age of
    the moral superiority of their religion and the legacy of their favor in God\u2019s
    eyes, a phenomenon that makes them quick to take whatever action they deem necessary
    in order to bring the unenlightened into the fold.\n\nIn its efforts to enforce
    this view, the empire has for centuries engaged in a campaign known as the Reclaiming,
    a holy war against unbelievers. The unfortunate losers of this war have historically
    been enslaved by the empire. Nominally, this slavery is designed to work off the
    sins of the non-Amarr until the day they will be free to enter Amarr society as
    enlightened followers. In practice, however, the holders\u2014the general name
    given to the slave-owning gentry\u2014usually pay mere lip service to this traditional
    duty, then go on to brutally work their slaves to death for profit.\n\nHolders
    are privileged elites who control hundreds of thousands of lives each, given more
    or less free rein to rule commoners however they see fit. Some are capricious
    tyrants, while others rule with temperance and justice. Due to their sweeping
    powers within their respective domains and the archaic bureaucracy they are entrenched
    in, the political interplay between holders is not so much a finely woven web
    as a tangle of thread, with rivalries, political marriages, and insidious double
    deals forming an impenetrable knot of interests and intrigues."

- body: "## History\n\n![Amarr landscape](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/3KYDTrt8mVCPtTl9ec7iaz/f0916d35020537f65c48c540a46ec557/Amarr_2.png)\n\n###
    Foundation\n\nThe oldest of all civilizations in New Eden, the Amarr trace their
    origins back to settlers on the planet of Athra thousands of years ago. Led by
    a prophet known as Gheinok the First, they were driven from the continent of Assimia
    following the collapse of the EVE Gate, eventually settling on an island known
    as Amarr. There they languished for centuries, as warlords waged bloody conflicts
    on each other and the church struggled to keep the faith alive.\n\nFrom these
    warlords rose the legendary first emperor, Amash-Akura. Amash-Akura conquered
    via sword and scripture, bringing the entire island under his command and founding
    the Amarr Empire in AD 16470. He codified laws, established the hereditary noble
    class of holders, and founded the religious body that would rule the empire, the
    Council of Apostles.\n\n### The Reclaiming\n\nFor nearly four thousand years the
    Amarr stagnated, unable and unwilling to venture beyond the confines of their
    island. This changed abruptly in AD 20022, when foreign ships belonging to the
    mercantile Udorian people landed. Though initially eager to trade, the Udorians
    brought with them ideals that threatened the Amarr way of life. The emperor ordered
    them enslaved and declared the beginning of the Reclaiming, a holy war intended
    to make the entire world part of the empire.\n\nDuring the early stages of the
    war, the Amarr discovered a nomadic people who had long fought against the Udorians.
    Finding eager and willing converts, the Amarr graced them with the name Khanid
    (meaning \u201Clittle lord\u201D or \u201Clordling\u201D) and employed them as
    shock troops and heavy infantry against the much larger but disunited Udorian
    states.\n\nOne by one, the Udorian nations fell and were enslaved by the Amarr
    until AD 20371, when the last holdout fell. The empire now covered Amarr Island
    and the continents of Assimia, Ves-Udor, and Cas-Udor. Eventually they managed
    to travel across the treacherous sea to discover the continent of Kathis, whose
    natives were powerless to stop the empire\u2019s inexorable march.\n\nIn AD 20544
    the last independent nation on Athra fell to the empire. The victorious emperor
    renamed the planet Amarr in celebration of the conquest. Millions of slaves toiled
    under wealthy holders who worked them harshly, while simultaneously offering them
    the salvation of God.\n\n### Expansion into Space\n\nThe Amarr dedicated the spoils
    of conquest to science, art, and philosophy. Eventually they began to spread off
    their planet, starting in AD 20572, when they first launched people into space.
    A slow expansion soon followed, especially once the Amarr discovered microbial
    life on the ocean world of Tamiroth. They placed a permanent colony there in AD
    20725.\n\nIn AD 21134, the Amarr stumbled across the remains of a star gate. Though
    the ancient structure no longer functioned, they were able to reverse engineer
    it and construct a completely new star gate. In order to open it, they had to
    send a cryoship filled with materials to construct a sister gate in the nearby
    star system of Hedion. It reached its destination fifty-three years later. With
    a foreign sun lighting their progress, the awoken workers constructed the star
    gate and sent a signal back to Amarr. In AD 21290, the gates flared to life.\n\n###
    Internal Schisms\n\nThe rediscovery of star gate technology sent the Amarr expanding
    across their local cluster, but as they spread, their ability to control their
    populace weakened. Under these conditions, an ancient cult known as the Sani Sabik
    was reestablished and allowed to proliferate. These blood worshipers had lurked
    in the shadows of Amarr religion for generations, always being stamped out, only
    to return decades later. This time, a group of them managed to evade Imperial
    authorities and fled to the then-distant constellation of Araz, where they founded
    the short-lived kingdom known as \u201CTakmahl.\u201D Though the Takmahl themselves
    are no longer to be found and their fate remains unknown, they are believed by
    many to be the origin of the feared Blood Raiders organization of today.\n\nAdditionally,
    there was the unfortunate case of Emperor Zaragram II. While initially just and
    pious, Zaragram slowly began to view himself as the living embodiment of God.
    He issued decree after decree that transferred power to him and transformed the
    state religion into a cult centered around himself. At the height of his delusion,
    Zaragram II ordered the construction of a \u201CCity of God\u201D in the system
    of Sasta where he could reside in seclusion from worldly distractions. As he entered
    his palace there for the first time, he was assassinated by his nephew, who came
    to be canonized as St. Tetrimon. It took the Council of Apostles years to purge
    Zaragram\u2019s changes, and indeed, some were never removed.\n\n### First Contact\n\nIn
    AD 21423, the Amarr opened a star gate to the Ealur system. There they discovered
    primitive humans living on the sixth planet. Though the Amarr were shaken by the
    existence of humans living on another planet, the emperor ordered them Reclaimed.
    They were quickly enslaved with minimal difficulty, replenishing a slave stock
    that had dwindled greatly over the previous thousand years.\n\nWith the revelation
    that they were not alone in the universe, the Amarr were thrown into a frenzy
    of rapid expansion. The thirst for slaves had been rekindled among the holders,
    and they rapidly constructed new star gates, searching for slaves. This rush yielded
    very little, however: only a few small populations, with now-forgotten names like
    Amdonish and Jakrin, were ever discovered.\n\n### Moral Reforms\n\nA new emperor,
    Heideran V, was crowned in AD 21870. In those days, the emperor was still considered
    the first among equals on the Council of Apostles. Heideran V was ambitious and
    noticed a few of Zaragram\u2019s changes had never been undone. This tipped the
    balance of power in his favor, and he declared the start of the Moral Reforms,
    designed to rewrite Scripture to make the emperor the undisputed political and
    religious ruler of the empire.\n\nThe Council of Apostles rebelled, but Heideran
    had allied himself with the five largest and most powerful holder families. His
    own family was the noble and esteemed Kador, who counted numerous emperors among
    their number. The Kor-Azor were ambitious up-and-comers who had begun a rapid
    ascent. Religious fundamentalists, the Ardishapur had seen their fortunes wane
    over the previous centuries but were eager for a comeback. The militant Sarum
    family counted some of the best generals among their ranks. Finally, the Khanid
    family, named after the people they were given dominion over, possessed the most
    elite troops in the empire.\n\nA bloody civil war tore the empire apart, leaving
    millions dead. It raged for decades, finally ending in AD 21930, with Heideran
    and his forces victorious. The five families who had allied with Heideran became
    the Heir Families, from whom future emperors would be chosen. Together with the
    emperor, they would form the Privy Council to govern the empire, while the Theology
    Council would oversee the Scriptures.\n\n### The Ni-Kunni and Minmatar\n\nSlave
    stocks were hit hard by the Moral Reforms and subsequent rebuilding effort. Fortunately
    for the empire, they discovered the Ni-Kunni in AD 22103. Living on a harsh, arid
    world, the Ni-Kunni viewed the Amarr as saviors almost as much as conquerors.\n\nA
    mere two hundred and fifty years later, the Amarr detected the first signs of
    another spacefaring race, the Minmatar. They conducted a few probing raids on
    the outskirts of Minmatar space before determining that this new race of people
    was greatly inferior to them technologically.\n\nIn AD 22480, Emperor Damius II
    ordered the full conquest of the Minmatar. While the Amarr Navy brutally destroyed
    defenses and infrastructure, six slave ships touched down on the inhabited planets
    in the Minmatar home system, Pator. Three whole planets were depopulated and two
    lost half their number, with only the home world, Matar, managing to put up significant
    resistance. At the end of the so-called Day of Darkness, hundreds of millions
    of Minmatar had been enslaved.\n\nThe Amarr continued their assault on the Minmatar,
    assisted by collaborators in the Nefantar tribe (who came to be known later as
    Ammatar). By AD 22485, the empire had fully conquered the Minmatar people. However,
    small bands managed to escape and form a resistance that would prove a constant
    thorn in the empire\u2019s side.\n\n### Unchallenged No Longer\n\nThe Amarr developed
    the jump drive in AD 23058, allowing them to move large ships instantly from one
    system to the next without first constructing a star gate. The surge of expansion
    that followed quickly brought them into contact with additional spacefaring nations.\n\nIn
    AD 23180, they made first contact with the Gallente Federation, a nation of democratic
    liberals to whom the Amarr theocracy and entrenched slavery was anathema. However,
    both nations proved too large and powerful to attack the other and they settled
    into an uneasy truce. Shortly after, they encountered the Caldari State, who were
    locked into a bitter war with the Gallente.\n\nFinally, they encountered the Jove
    in AD 23191. Initial contact was limited, and the Amarr took this as a sign of
    weakness from the Jove. The Amarr, hungry for fresh slaves, believed the Jove
    were a soft target and announced their plans to invade.\n\n### Amarr-Jove War\n\nThe
    Amarr sent a single squadron, numbering roughly two hundred ships, to invade the
    Jove system of Vak\u2019Atioth. Confident the battle would be a one-sided affair,
    the Amarr imagined quickly overrunning the panicked Jove and pressing them into
    bondage.\n\nInstead it was the Jove who turned the battle into a massacre. Their
    small, nimble frigates pinned down the lumbering Amarr battleships while the massive
    doomsday weapons of the Jovian mother ship cut swaths through Imperial forces.
    Battle doctrine compelled the Amarr to stay on the field until they were slaughtered
    to a man.\n\n### Minmatar Rebellion\n\nBloodied but not beaten, the Amarr prepared
    a second strike on the Jove. At that moment, slaves across the empire rose up
    in rebellion. Backed by Minmatar freedom fighters, Gallente sympathizers, and
    a small group of Jove agents, the Minmatar rebels were able to make swift gains
    before the Amarr could counterattack.\n\nThe massed, synchronized rebellion was
    something the Amarr had never envisioned. Millions of Amarr, holder and commoner
    alike, were slaughtered in the first few days. In the course of a few months,
    the Amarr were forced out of Minmatar space. Under the orders of Emperor Heideran
    VII, the Amarr abandoned large tracts of territory to the rebels, who founded
    the Minmatar Republic.\n\n### Reign of Doriam II\n\nIn YC 105, after a three-hundred-year
    rule, Heideran VII succumbed to Turit\u2019s disease. The Succession Trials were
    held, with the heirs being represented for the first time by the newly emerged
    capsuleer class. Doriam Kor-Azor, championed by the pilot Eclipticum, emerged
    victorious.\n\nDoriam II caused waves within the empire by interceding in arguments
    between the new heirs and taking a stance of appeasement toward the Minmatar Republic.
    However, in YC 107, the Blood Raiders\u2014an offshoot of the Sani Sabik\u2014began
    a reign of terror against the empire under the direction of the deranged Omir
    Sarikusa. Doriam declared war on the Blood Raiders and, within a few short months,
    the empire ousted them from the Bleak Lands. The victory was short lived, however,
    as Doriam was assassinated by unknown assailants on July fourth of that year.\n\n###
    Karsoth Interregnum\n\nThe loss of two emperors within such a short period was
    nearly unprecedented in the empire. The Sarum family had not yet even named a
    successor to the fiery Jamyl Sarum. The other heirs, young and ambitious, were
    reluctant to begin the Succession Trials and put their own lives at risk.\n\nInstead,
    Court Chamberlain Dochuta Karsoth assumed power. Unbeknownst to many, the once-pious
    Karsoth had grown twisted and cynical in his long years of service, giving himself
    fully to the corrupt Sani Sabik faith. As holders battled each other in capricious
    wars, Minmatar freedom fighters harassed the empire\u2019s lawless borders, and
    heirs such as Aritcio Kor-Azor engaged in tyranny, Karsoth watched with glee.\n\n###
    Elder Invasion\n\nThe Starkmanir tribe had long been thought extinct following
    a genocide perpetrated by the Ardishapur family, but in YC 110 a group was discovered
    alive on a remote slave colony. Karsoth secretly ordered their execution while
    publicly assuaging the Minmatar.\n\nBefore his assassins could strike, a fleet
    of rogue Minmatar under the legendary Elders invaded. Throwing the empire into
    confusion, they struck multiple slave colonies by deploying Insorum, the antidote
    to a drug called Vitoc which was used to keep slaves under control. The suddenly
    free slaves rose up in rebellion as the Amarr Navy was repeatedly driven back.\n\nJust
    when the Amarr seemed poised to fall, Jamyl Sarum returned from death to lead
    a counterattack. At the helm of a powerful superweapon of mysterious origin, she
    devastated the Elder fleet and sent it fleeing to the republic.\n\n### Reign of
    Jamyl I\n\nDespite having committed suicide following her loss to Doriam II, Jamyl
    claimed to have been resurrected by God to be the savior of the empire. Though
    the heirs knew she had been cloned\u2014a grave sin for Amarr heirs\u2014all but
    Yonis Ardishapur bent their knee to her. Even he eventually grudgingly agreed
    to crown Jamyl empress.\n\nUnder Jamyl\u2019s reign, the empire has regained much
    of its previous glory. She made the reformed Aritcio Kor-Azor her imperial chancellor
    and tasked her rival Yonis Ardishapur with repairing the destruction wrought by
    the Elder fleet. In a calculated move, she freed millions of Minmatar slaves with
    a single decree, sending a surge of religious converts into the republic, where
    they began to sow dissent. With the aid of the Khanid Kingdom, she captured and
    executed Karsoth, leading to a reconciliation with Khanid II.\n\nShe also oversaw
    the creation of the first cloned soldiers as part of the Templar project. When
    they proved unstable, she abandoned the project and warned the other nations against
    it\u2014advice none followed, to their own detriment.\n\nToday the empire is perhaps
    the strongest nation in New Eden, with the largest population, most stable economy,
    and the greatest amount of territory. However, the Minmatar wage war against the
    empire, while the heirs scheme for their own power."

- body: "## Political Structure\n\nThe Amarr Empire is a feudal theocratic monarchy
    which can best be described as a single state made up of five vassal kingdoms
    governed by princes\u2014known as the Amarr heirs\u2014 who submit to the central
    authority of the Amarr emperor. Beneath the heirs sit the feudal lords known as
    the holders, who rule as the dukes and barons of various planets, moons, space
    stations, colonies, continents, and other holdings.\n\n![Amarr ritual](//images.ctfassets.net/1gqwxa4vbed9/4zT32SYmlX2uAENDCexhIx/144d2a591fa11cdcb7b278ced21ca954/Amarr_ritual.png)\n\n###
    The Emperor\n\nThe [Amarr Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) has numerous roles
    within the Amarr government. He is both sovereign of the Amarr state and leader
    of the Amarr religion. Primary among his duties is that of enforcer of the Scriptures,
    the holy laws of the empire. He also holds tremendous sway over the creation and
    issuance of new laws. Such decrees can be widespread and sweeping or extremely
    limited in scope. As the emperor speaks with the voice of God, he may countermand
    the Scriptures when necessary, as well as emphasize those that reinforce his position.\n\nThe
    emperor is technically the highest court in the empire as well, able to overturn
    any ruling set forth by the lower courts of heirs. In the past, he held open court,
    but this practice became untenable as the empire grew. These days, the emperor
    only levies judgments in extreme cases, such as when the empire itself is harmed.\n\nIn
    theory, the emperor\u2019s rule is absolute. In practice, he typically only has
    influence when personally present. Instead he relies on a number of officials,
    vassals, and governmental bodies to carry out his orders. While the emperor can
    make decisions that run counter to the wishes of his underlings, he does so at
    risk. An emperor must carefully balance the wishes of a number of rival factions
    so that none undermine his rule.\n\nWhen an emperor dies, his successor is chosen
    from the heirs of five royal families. The families undergo a ritual known as
    the Succession Trials, with the winner cutting himself off from his family when
    crowned. The losers all must commit ritual suicide, a ceremony known as Shathol\u2019Syn.
    In theory, this prevents the losers from challenging the new emperor\u2019s rule.\n\n###
    The Heirs\n\nThe Amarr [Heirs](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) are the heads of the five
    royal families who hold permanent seats on the Privy Council. They are the Ardishapur,
    Kador, Kor-Azor, Sarum, and Tash-Murkon families. The heirs are often compared
    to kings or princes of vassal kingdoms.\n\nThe heirs function in a way similar
    to the emperor, albeit on a more limited scale. They are responsible for keeping
    the peace and enforcing the empire\u2019s laws. They may also create their own
    laws which may be limited or broad, for the greater good or utterly capricious.
    They also collect taxes, regulate trade, and act as judge and jury for their vassals.
    In some ways, they are less fettered than the emperor, as their domains are so
    subdivided that organized opposition can rarely mobilize. However, widespread
    abuses by the heirs have historically met with severe repercussions.\n\n### Privy
    Council\n\nThe Privy Council is technically the governing body of the empire,
    but in reality it is a political battleground for its members. It is composed
    of the emperor, the five heirs, the imperial chancellor and court chamberlain,
    the high deacon of the Theology Council, the Khanid family representative, the
    heads of the five imperial ministries, and the grand admiral of the Imperial Navy.
    The council holds informal meetings known as closed sessions attended by the emperor,
    heirs, and chamberlain. Full sessions with everyone in attendance are rarer.\n\nThe
    council is almost always split into various factions vying for their own way.
    The emperor must carefully juggle their interests, trying to keep from angering
    any one faction too much. It has often been joked that if the council does not
    end with every side feeling it has lost, the emperor has done a poor job.\n\n###
    Holders\n\nThe holder class makes up the diverse, byzantine hierarchy that sits
    below the heirs. Much as the heirs are lesser emperors, the holders are lesser
    heirs. They possess many of the same powers, albeit restricted to their own spheres
    of influence. However, the majority of holders are far more hands on in their
    rule than the heirs and are personally responsible for more mundane tasks.\n\nThere
    are three basic tiers of holder, though these are rough approximations and may
    vary from region to region or even system to system. At the top are holders who
    oversee entire constellations or groups of systems. Somewhat below them are the
    holders who control individual systems. Last are planetary holders, who despite
    their name may only own a single continent, city, or even space station. Of course,
    not all domains are made equal. The holder of a rich, populous city may be better
    off than one who holds three desolate planets in the dead end of Aridia.\n\n###
    Imperial Courts\n\nThe empire possesses two separate, empire-wide courts. They
    are typically referred to as Imperial Courts and consist of the Theology Council
    and the Civic Court. The Theology Council is by far the more powerful and prestigious
    of the two, as it deals with religious crimes, which hold a much wider scope in
    the empire than is often realized. The Civic Court deals solely with secular matters,
    limiting both its influence and power.\n\nIn truth, the Civic Court tends to deal
    with commoners, misdemeanor crimes, and violations of local ordinances. The Theology
    Council deals with any crime that is proscribed by the Scriptures. This covers
    a wide range of potential crimes, everything from murder and heresy to theft and
    adultery. The Theology Council also acts as an appeals court for both the Civic
    Court and the courts of holders and the heirs.\n\n### Imperial Offices\n\nThe
    two Imperial offices are often referred to as the left and right hands of the
    emperor. The two offices are often conflated and tend to step on each other\u2019s
    toes in pursuit of power. When one is ascendant, the other is often weakened as
    a result. Currently, the post of imperial chancellor is the more powerful of the
    two. Held by Heir Aritcio Kor-Azor, the office of the imperial chancellor administrates
    the vast bureaucracy of the empire by being the overseer of a majority of the
    Imperial Ministries. He additionally acts as the penultimate law enforcer in the
    empire, answering only to the emperor himself.\n\nThe court chamberlain is the
    emperor\u2019s primary advisor and confidant. He speaks with the full authority
    of the emperor and, when the emperor is absent, is considered to be of equal importance.
    The court chamberlain thus functions, in many cases, as a surrogate for the emperor,
    essentially allowing the emperor to exert his authority in two places at one time.\n\n###
    Imperial Ministries\n\nFinally, the imperial bureaucracy is overseen by several
    ministries. These ministries are all highly political and can engage in skullduggery
    easily equal to that of the most cunning heir. Each wields enormous power and
    influence, particularly over the commoners of the empire. The Amarr Civil Service
    is the largest employer in the empire and deals with the more mundane acts of
    governance. It is responsible for issuing permits, managing the Imperial Archives,
    maintaining public utilities, and overseeing the infrastructure of government.\n\nThe
    Amarr Trade Registry oversees the finances of the empire. It monitors all commercial
    transactions within the empire\u2014at least those made legally\u2014and collects
    taxes for the emperor. With its hands in the economy of the empire, it is perhaps
    the most important of all ministries. The Ministry of Assessment has fallen on
    hard times recently, as exploration by the empire has slowed significantly. It
    continues to hold dominion over the empire\u2019s natural resources and parcels
    out contracts to various holders to exploit those resources.\n\nThe Ministry of
    Internal Order is the primary intelligence and police force within the empire.
    It works alongside the Theology Council to root out heretics and keep the peace.
    It also spies on foreign nations, though it is regarded as less adept at this
    than the intelligence offices of the other empires. Finally, the Ministry of War
    oversees all branches of the empire\u2019s armed forces, including the cluster\u2019s
    largest navy, the Imperial Navy. While traditionally staffed by civilians, under
    the rule of Jamyl I the ministry has become far more militarized and now acts
    as a central command for the empire\u2019s military."

- body: "## Religion and Culture\n\nPerhaps the most notable cultural characteristic
    of the Amarr (and certainly the one most often cited by their detractors) is their
    apparent unwillingness to be influenced by other cultures. As with most generalizations,
    this one is not entirely correct, yet not entirely wrong either: the empire\u2019s
    cultural output is tremendous, but as is the case with its population and several
    other aspects of its national makeup, the emphasis is more on quantity and uniformity
    than on thematic originality or stylistic invention.\n\n### Religion\n\n![Amarr
    Cathedral Entrance](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/464olV6bYYQZNVETWf9bAh/05196981ae72df8179f3152af50898e9/Amarr_1.png#right)\n\nAmarr
    religion is exacting and dogmatic, placing a great deal of emphasis on the service
    of the individual to the greater good (almost without exception expressed as \u201CGod\u201D
    or \u201Cthe empire\u201D). Its tenets are laid down in a set of books known collectively
    as the Scriptures. An almost unfathomably large collection of holy texts, the
    Scriptures are Amarr\u2019s attempt to set in stone everything pertinent to the
    great mechanisms of religion and empire\u2014they are not only a fundamental social
    contract but also a repository for historical codes of behavior, technological
    breakthroughs, and formative myths, among many other things. The collective writings
    have been maintained and updated throughout the centuries by imperial theologians
    and include texts that hark back to the very origins of Amarr society. The most
    defining characteristic of the doctrine, and one that emerges time and time again,
    is the affirmation of the Amarr as the chosen people of God, the race destined
    to rule the universe in his name.\n\nLong ago, the Scriptures say, a great disaster
    befell a corrupt and sinful mankind. Through these dark times only the Amarr maintained
    faith, and they alone were spared the worst of the hardships. God then bade the
    Amarr go forth and conquer the world in his name, until all of creation was worshiping
    at his altar. This mission drives the Amarr in every respect. Those descended
    from the original inhabitants of Amarr Island (called True Amarr) are held aloft
    by the rest of Amarr society, viewed as sacred paragons of piety. Other bloodlines
    are forever tainted by the sins of their ancestors; no matter how pious, no matter
    how fervent and faithful, they shall never match the unstained purity of the True
    Amarr soul. Discrimination, while not always overt, is a fact of life in the empire
    and accepted as natural. The impure can always strive toward the True Amarr ideal,
    but they will forever fall short.\n\n### Culture\n\nDue no doubt to its ubiquity,
    religious iconography has represented a starting point in most of the Amarr\u2019s
    major artistic movements through the ages. Sculptures are by far the most common
    form of art, usually depicting scriptural figures varying in size and importance,
    from the most minor (children, slaves) to the grandest (saints, angels). Despite
    the natural variance in terms of styles and materials across inhabited Amarr worlds,
    art historians have nonetheless found the general similarity of designs and motifs
    among planetary cultures to be remarkable. In addition to sculpture, the Amarr
    cultural oeuvre is largely taken up with painting and theater. Their painting
    tends to utilize both traditional oil paints, as well as more modern light paints
    and hypertexturized materials, but again the modernity ends there: in terms of
    both style and content, the scriptural influence is front and center.\n\nThe general
    consensus among cultural scholars is that the empire\u2019s strong preference
    for strictly scriptural visual arts and its disinclination toward original literature
    are phenomena stemming directly from the top\u2014that it has been ingrained into
    the populace for hundreds of years by their emperors that art and beauty lie in
    visual depictions of the truths that have already been recorded in words, rather
    than trying to rephrase those truths in different words. Indeed, it appears the
    general feeling is that any attempt to do so would be not only useless but also
    rather unseemly\u2014perhaps even sacrilegious.\n\nNaturally, as would happen
    anywhere, this has given rise to rarified artistic movements that make it their
    mission to be as subversive in this regard as possible. Mostly hailing from peripheral
    worlds, these movements tend to crop up every few years, each making a defiant
    stand against their art establishment\u2019s deeply rooted conformism, and each
    ultimately falling prey to the deadening effects of the Amarr\u2019s cultural
    inertia. The government need not even intervene; most of these movements are quietly
    and slowly quelled by the crushing weight of millennia-old tradition.\n\nEver
    since early settler days on Athra (the planet now known as Amarr Prime), religion
    has been of paramount importance to the Amarr. After the closure of the EVE Gate,
    faith provided the social glue that kept their sect together. Later, it was their
    beliefs that provided the moral certitude which enabled them to expand and blossom
    into a fullblown empire.\n\n### Society\n\nReligious belief leads to great stratification
    in Amarr society, with the True Amarr presiding above and the conquered considered
    to be lesser citizens. At the very top stand the holders and the clergy. Below
    the nobles come the commoners, men and women who do not possess the divine right
    to rule but are still considered free in the eyes of the law. While free, however,
    they will rarely ascend past the rigidly defined ceiling of whatever caste they
    were born into. They must accept their place in the world and realize there is
    little opportunity for advancement. While the lowborn occasionally manage to become
    wealthy merchants, or win esteem as war heroes, they must resign themselves to
    never being viewed with true respect or admiration by those born into privilege.\n\nFinally
    come the slaves. Slavery in the empire covers a broad range of professions. While
    many slaves are unskilled laborers in fields and mining colonies, a significant
    number are trained by their masters to fill roles that even commoners are rarely
    able to attain. The most intelligent and talented slaves receive higher educations
    and work as scientists, academics, accountants, and even military specialists.
    Others fill low-ranking clerical roles in both the civil service and the church.
    Regardless of occupation, however, one thing unites every slave: they are never
    allowed to forget that they are slaves, beholden to their masters\u2019 whims,
    liable to be bought and sold at any time."

- body: "## Growing Up in the Amarr Empire\n\nA person\u2019s life in the empire is
    largely determined at birth. The child of a holder can expect to be given healthy
    food, receive the best education, and never want for anything. Aside from the
    children of highly exceptional individuals, commoners must make due with less
    in all aspects. Their food will be acceptable, their teachers decent but unspectacular,
    and they will know the need to ration and budget. Slave children can look forward
    to hard lives laboring for their masters, though the best and brightest might
    be selected to receive advanced education, or be taken from their parents to be
    indoctrinated as one of the slave soldiers known as Kameiras.\n\nRegardless, everyone
    born in the empire has one thing in common: a constant reinforcement of religion,
    the natural order of True Amarr and holders at the top with all others beneath
    them, and an unrelenting loyalty to the heirs and the empress. The church will
    be a constant presence in their lives, from the day they are born (with their
    names recorded in the Book of Records by a trained priest) to the day they die
    (when another priest closes their entries in that same book). Daily worship and
    devotion is expected of everyone. The rare few who do not comply are shunned as
    heretics and sinners.\n\nEven in this, the children of holders have an easier
    time of it. Their ancestors proved the piety of their blood. They need not spend
    as much time on their knees in prayer; rather, they are tasked much more with
    learning how to rule. Private tutors educate them in the ways of economics, rhetoric,
    diplomacy, and war. The favored heir of a holder is given the best. Less-favored
    siblings may be expected to become priests, enlist in the navy, or take up a noble
    profession such as barrister, doctor, or slaver. Both young men and women may
    find themselves married off to other families to secure political alliances or
    produce claimants for titles or even to seal business deals.\n\nChildren of commoners
    usually follow in the footsteps of their parents. The eldest typically have the
    least freedom in this respect, as they are groomed to take over businesses or
    learn the family trade. Siblings may be recruited into the trade for larger businesses,
    but for those families with simple trades, they are free to explore their own
    path in the world. Commoners often take up the trades the nobles find distasteful,
    particularly anything that involves manual labor. \n\nFinally, slaves rarely get
    any education beyond a religious one. Only those who display great acumen at a
    young age and are singled out by their holders can hope to learn anything beyond
    the most basic knowledge necessary to do their jobs. Life as a slave child is
    hard and monotonous, yet it is rarely dangerous, as a child is a valuable commodity
    to a holder. In this respect, the children of slaves may find themselves taken
    from their parents at a young age, sold to another holder who has more use for
    future laborers than he does for money."

- body: "## Bloodlines\n\n### True Amarr\n\nPious but intractable, charismatic but
    haughty, the [True Amarr](2DkiJVfiL1RYP5y7AJGSNN) are the dominant bloodline in
    the empire and are both hated and respected for it. Foreigners often consider
    the True Amarr to be little more than slaving zealots who use religion as an excuse
    to tread on the backs of the commoners and slaves for their own personal gain.
    While this is accurate in some cases, the True Amarr are deeply faithful and want
    nothing more than their fellow man to be safe and happy, under the glory of God
    and the Amarr Empire, of course.\n\nMany True Amarr view their own bloodline as
    spiritually superior to all others. This is backed up in the Scriptures, which
    name the True Amarr as the chosen people of God, tasked with Reclaiming the universe
    and bringing all people under one religion. This belief pervades nearly all aspects
    of a True Amarr\u2019s life, often leading to problems with other bloodlines,
    particularly when dealing with non-Amarr.\n\n### Khanid\n\nThe only bloodline
    to have been mostly spared the indignity of slavery, the [Khanid](1IRIdXfOZrfl5BuFuabOh6)
    have faithfully served beside the True Amarr since the early years of the [Reclaiming](70QLNGRwCwHUgmcjTmuhsA).
    Originally a nomadic people on the Amarr home world, they joined the early empire
    as shock troops and heavy infantry in the war with the Udorians, winning themselves
    great acclaim and respect. The Amarr gave them their name, which means \u201Clittle
    lordling\u201D in an old dialect, a term the Khanid have embraced completely.\n\nThey
    are well known for their zealotry, so much that many other Amarr find them overbearing.
    However, the Khanid are deeply loyal and fierce in their defense of the faith.
    They have earned the respect of the True Amarr a thousand times over and hold
    essentially equal status within the empire. Many Khanid have risen to the ranks
    of holder\u2014something virtually no other non\u2013True Amarr bloodline can
    claim\u2014and are seen at every echelon of Amarr society, just as successful
    if not more so than their True Amarr counterparts.\n\n### Ni-Kunni\n\nOne of the
    few slave races in the empire to have attained a widespread measure of freedom,
    the Ni-Kunni were originally native to the arid world of [Mishi IV](7Bwu0uJL7wrbt0fUkszc0V).
    When the Amarr conquered them, the Ni-Kunni willingly took to slavery, finding
    it not much worse than life on their uncomfortable home world. As a result, the
    Ni-Kunni are known for having escaped slavery faster than any of the other bloodlines
    (as the majority of Khanid were never enslaved).\n\nThe Ni-Kunni occupy a middle
    ground in Amarr society. They only claim a few small families as holders, but
    they have a very large number of wealthy merchants and businessmen among them,
    giving them more influence than their size would suggest. Ni-Kunni businesses
    flourish in many areas of the empire and several industries run on the backbone
    of Ni-Kunni ingenuity and acumen. However, many Ni-Kunni remain poor and live
    around the poverty line. Discrimination against Ni-Kunni is not harsh but it is
    endemic, and often Ni- Kunni find getting ahead in the world is difficult compared
    to their True Amarr or Khanid counterparts.\n\n### Other Bloodlines\n\nBillions
    of Minmatar live within the empire, either as slaves or the descendants of slaves.
    Those free Minmatar are often the subject of intense discrimination and distrust
    from the Amarr, particularly in the wake of the Elder Invasion. Most free Minmatar
    occupy the lowest rung of society, struggling to survive, though some enterprising
    or pious individuals have made respectable lives for themselves. However, as the
    centuries pass and old biases begin to fade, many expect the Minmatar to slowly
    gain more and more power within the empire.\n\n#### Ealur\n\nThe [Ealur](6TgmS6RKjOYM1Id08VBZzk),
    though having been enslaved longer than any others, remain in bondage. The empire
    has had them in shackles for so long that the Amarr almost view them as incapable
    of surviving if free. Much transformed from the soft natives the Amarr discovered
    thousands of years ago, the modern Ealur are tough and fit. Very few of them are
    free; those that are tend to live lonely, uninspiring lives due to prejudices
    and lack of opportunity.\n\n#### Udorians\n\nThe Udorian culture is from the same
    planet, Amarr Prime, as the Khanid and True Amarr. The [Udorians](723tMHRDvyldo15RMLMuqh)
    arrived on [Amarr Island](4wZzhhUMIfR4ziHGaMOiLJ) in 20,022 AD, spurring the static
    Amarr society into rapid changes. Later, they were assimilated in the Athran Reclaiming.
    They have long since been fully integrated into the Empire, to the point where
    there is now a [Udorian Royal House](4t1KEOTA8LvYIHDcOtIPAb). The social and physical
    difference between the True Amarr and Udorians disappeared ages ago, although
    some traditionalists try to maintain some social and religious distinction between
    them."

- body: "## Notable Characters\n\n### Empress Jamyl I\n\nThe empress is loved by those
    close to her, feared and hated by her enemies, and revered by her subjects. Born
    into the militaristic Sarum family, Jamyl was groomed from a young age to rise
    to the top of Imperial society. Though confident she would succeed Heideran VII,
    she lost the Succession Trials to Doriam Kor-Azor and committed suicide as required
    by religious law. But when the empire was in a moment of darkness at the hands
    of the Elder Fleet, Jamyl miraculously returned from death to lead the Amarr in
    a counterattack. Widely hailed as a living incarnation of divine rebirth, Jamyl
    ascended the Imperial throne as a heroine.\n\nThe secrets of Jamyl\u2019s rise
    to power are known by few. Her resurrection was not an act of God, but rather
    cloning: a grave sin for one born of royal flesh. Additionally, this cloning did
    not go as planned. Somewhere in the process a foreign intelligence invaded her
    mind. The Other, as it is known, constantly torments Jamyl, sometimes taking over
    her mind and body during moments of weakness.\n\nHow much of Jamyl\u2019s public
    persona has been usurped by the Other may never be known by anyone but the empress
    herself. And whether the Other will lead the empire to ruin or greatness remains
    to be seen.\n\n### Aritcio Kor-Azor\n\nThe only son of the prior emperor, Doriam
    II, Aritcio Kor- Azor was known in his earlier years as a capricious and sadistic
    tyrant. His father, blind to his flaws, named him his successor in the Kor-Azor
    family, which nearly led the family to ruin. During his short reign, Aritcio notably
    defiled a sacred cathedral, brazenly purchased slaves from the Guristas, subjected
    his subordinates to arbitrary and unjust punishments, and watched in glee as his
    vassals waged open war on one another.\n\nThe travesties grew so great his subjects
    openly rebelled against him. The Speakers of Truth, a sect of the Theology Council
    whose word can override even the emperor, brought his reign of terror to a halt.
    The Speakers ordered Aritcio to undergo a horrific punishment, having his flesh
    stripped away and regrown over and over for each individual Aritcio had wronged.\n\nThe
    experience left Aritcio deeply changed. Gone were his vicious ways. In their place
    was a faithful and contemplative man who wished his subjects only the best. Rumors
    claim he travels across his domains, righting wrongs done to both commoner and
    holder alike, sometimes without even acknowledging who he is. As a reward for
    his deeds, Empress Jamyl I named him her imperial chancellor, tasking him with
    enforcing the law throughout the empire. \n\n### Yonis Ardishapur\n\nThe royal
    heir of the Ardishapur family, Yonis stands in stark opposition to Empress Jamyl
    I. He is a deeply conservative and religious man who adheres strongly to the Scriptures
    and believes the empress to be a deviant sinner who has perverted the Imperial
    throne and deserves nothing more than death. However, he is politically wise enough
    to know he could never topple the empress on his own. Instead, he quietly gathers
    his power and influence and opposes the empress whenever he can without harming
    the empire.\n\nFollowing the Elder Invasion, Yonis poured money into a public-works
    project, building schools, churches, and other infrastructure to better his domains.
    In order to curb his growing power, the empress granted him dominion over the
    Ammatar Mandate, a vassal state of the empire populated by the descendants of
    those Minmatar who had collaborated with the Amarr. Many expected Yonis, well
    known for being a True Amarr supremacist, of oppressing and alienating his new
    subjects. Instead, he continued his public-works program and rebuilt the decimated
    Mandate into a bastion of culture and faith. More recently, Yonis has embarked
    on a series of speaking tours across the empire, preaching strict adherence to
    the Scriptures for all bloodlines, be they Amarr or otherwise. His passionate
    yet nonviolent rhetoric has won him many admirers in the empire. Behind closed
    doors, however, he still schemes, waiting for the day when he can dethrone the
    empress.\n\n### Catiz Tash-Murkon\n\nThe richest woman in the cluster, Catiz is
    the heir of the wealthy and influential Tash-Murkon family. Though possessing
    Udorian ancestry has put her at odds with many of the more conservative elements
    in the empire, she has risen above this to gain the favor of the empress herself.
    Catiz rules over the most economically powerful region of the empire and has brokered
    trade agreements with both the Khanid Kingdom and the Caldari State.\n\nPossessing
    a keen business acumen, Catiz broke away from her family at a young age and founded
    her own business from scratch as a lone miner, eventually parlaying that into
    an immense personal wealth. Since then, she has proven time and time again that
    she knows more about the Imperial economy than anyone in New Eden, drawing the
    respect and admiration of many of the more progressive holders and merchants in
    the empire.\n\nCatiz was instrumental in bringing the Khanid Kingdom back into
    the Imperial fold, for which the empress owes her greatly. As yet, however, Catiz
    has not shown much ambition beyond amassing her own wealth and influence.\n\n###
    Uriam Kador\n\nOnce considered one of the noblest minds in the empire, Uriam Kador
    has more recently fallen out of favor in imperial politics. As the heir to the
    grand Kador family, which has counted more emperors in its number than any other
    house, Uriam was expected to continue that tradition of excellence. In the early
    days, it seemed as if he would. The charismatic and handsome heir was known as
    a poet and philosopher who embodied his ancestor Heideran VII\u2019s ideals of
    peace and progress.\n\nHowever, he later made a series of missteps which brought
    him great misfortune. Most recently, he launched an unprovoked and unauthorized
    invasion of the Gallente Federation region of Solitude, utilizing his personal
    family fleet. The invasion was crushed once the Federation Navy jumped an Erebusclass
    Titan onto the field. Enraged, Empress Jamyl I stripped the Kador family of its
    personal fleet and allowed the federation to launch a retaliatory strike to retrieve
    a traitor being harbored by Uriam.\n\nThis folly also cost Uriam his closest ally,
    Yonis Ardishapur, who came to view the man as an idiot whose reputation exceeded
    his talents. Since then, Uriam has struggled to repair his tattered influence,
    but has found few willing to put their trust in him and risk the empress\u2019s
    ire.\n\n### Merimeth Sarum\n\nThe nephew of the empress, Merimeth is the youngest
    and newest of all the heirs. Forced to sit in waiting for several years while
    Jamyl planned her return, Merimeth has had few opportunities to prove himself.
    Despite this, he is known as an intelligent and calculating man with lofty ambitions
    and a willingness to do whatever it takes to get ahead.\n\nMerimeth was once an
    agent for the Ministry of Internal Order, giving him deep connections to the Amarr
    intelligence community. He has proven himself unafraid to use these connections
    to gain the upper hand against his rivals. He also takes after the Sarum family
    tradition of being aggressive, particularly with the other nations, often being
    a voice of encouragement for a full relaunch of the Reclaiming against the Minmatar.\n\nHowever,
    Merimeth\u2019s youth and experience often work against him. The other heirs have
    been quick to ignore him and even his own aunt, Empress Jamyl I, shows him little
    favor. Those who understand Merimeth know he will not abide by such disrespect
    for long. The only question is when he will finally make his move.\n"
