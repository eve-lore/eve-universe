    home world of the [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp). It is sometimes\nreferred
    to by the Minmatar as \"Old Mother.\"\n\nHistorical Background\n---------------------\n\nFar
    from New Eden, the system CMS-17 wasn't discovered until 8017 AD.\nLater renamed
    Pator, the fourth planet of this system was named Matar\nand was quickly colonized.
    After the collapse of the [EVE Gate](2z1KQXUVtPP1WmlwcJaX4o),\nthere was a dark
    age on Matar until 18622\nAD, when four distinct civilizations rose simultaneously.
    They became\naware of each other, though they lacked the means to stay in sustained,\nmeaningful
    contact. Approximately eight hundred years later, the tribes\namalgamated and
    the new planetary culture that developed is still\napparent in the Minmatar today.
    \n\nOrbit and Climate\n-----------------\n\nMatar has an orbit of 2.663 AU giving
    it a year of 1357 days. This\nrelatively long orbit period, along with Matar's
    minimal axis tilt,\nresults in very mild seasonal changes. With a surface that
    is 85% water,\nand lacking polar ice caps most of the year, the planet maintains
    a\nyearly average mean temperature of 306 K, or 32.85 Celsius. These\nconditions
    have made Matar especially conducive to hosting life, and it\nis home to millions
    of species.\n\nTectonic Plates\n---------------\n\nThere are seven large tectonic
    plates on Matar, though there is very\nlittle tectonic activity. The two largest,
    the Atatlian and Caribo\nPlates, are suboceanic. The An Oon Plate in the northern
    arctic region\nis almost entirely submerged as well, contributing only one small
    island\nchain to Matar's landmass. The remaining four share the same longitudes\nand
    supply the majority of the planet's landmass. They are the four\ncontinents of
    Matar: Mikramurka, Houdea, Coricia, and Mioar.\n\nContinents\n----------\n###
    Coricia\n\nStraddling the equator, Coricia is the largest of the continents. Home\nto
    sweeping meadows and plains, large deserts and forests, and high\nplateaus and
    low-lying marshlands, it is also one of the most diverse.\nThe old administrative
    center of Matar City lies on the northern coast of Coricia. This city was much
    enlarged under Amarr rule and served as the headquarters of the Amarr occupation
    forces. It was also a major spaceport used for slave transportation offworld.
    After the Great Rebellion and liberation of Matar, the Amarr-built city was discovered
    by Republic archaeologists to have been constructed over an obliterated cult center
    dedicated to the planet itself. The Republic Parliament once sat in Matar City
    but has shifted its location to the expanding town surrounding the Great Caravanserai.\n\nThe
    Eyniletti Plains on this continent are the ancestral lands of the\n[Starkmanir
    Tribe](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw). The [Vherokior Tribe](6VDPzsKX9TVbVtXEwjj0RB)
    ancestral lands are also on Coricia, in the Greater Sobaki Desert, north of the
    Sobaki Sands. The Great Caravanserai is located at the edge of the plains, in
    the lee of some rocky hills close to  the Greater Sobaki Desert. The Great Caravanserai
    is the seat of the Tribal Council and the location where the Tribal Assembly is
    held. Though the concept of a formal national capital is resisted by the Minmatar
    tribes, the Great Caravanserai and the township surrounding it has for all practical
    purposes assumed the role of government center.\n\nJust south of the Sobaki Sands
    is Kulburis, situated on the coast in\nthe former lands of the Starkmanir. Although
    severely damaged and all but abandoned during the Amarr Occupation, Kulburis is
    once more becoming a major regional center and government town. It has a shopping
    district near the beach where numerous performers and artists work for coins,
    but its real claim\nto fame is its proximity to one of the most sacred sites on
    Matar, the\nCrystal Desert. A large plain of crystallized rock formed by the\nthrusters
    of one or more huge colonization ships, it is commonly believed by the Minmatar
    to be the first landing site of the original colonists.\nPermanent structures
    are forbidden in the area surrounding the Crystal Desert,\nthough the number of
    rituals held there, as well as the site's\nimportance, has more or less led to
    a permanent tent-city near the\nsite.\n\n### Houdea\n\nHoudea in the northern
    hemisphere hosts the planet's most mountainous\ncontinent, as well as its longest
    river. The Tronhadar river carves a\nvalley over five thousand kilometers long,
    from its source in the Krusu\nMountains, to the Jade Coast. The ancestral home
    of the\n[Krusual Tribe](7KI9OEieV9sdjksayCyoGk) is here, in the isolated Upper
    Tronhadar Valley. The [Nefantar](1lfEcB4SdrV3EJIrmYWOK2) tribe\noriginally occupied
    the lowlands and coastal areas.\n\n### Mikramurka\n\nThe Mikramurka continent
    is in the northern arctic region, and is best\nknown for the vast steppes that
    are the ancestral lands of the\n[Sebiestor Tribe](1fNour0sFTIcCFRVQM2pro). A large
    amount of silica in the soil, and a distinction as one of the few places that\nexperience
    regular freezing in the winters, make these steppes one of\nthe most inhospitable
    places on Matar. The most notable settlement in Mikramurka is the city of Mithuris.
    This city lies close to the Crystal Steppe, another plateau of crystallized silica
    rock believed to have been formed by the thrusters of a colonization ship that
    brought settlers to the Mikramurka aeons ago. The Crystal Steppe is similar in
    status to the larger feature on the continent of Coricia known as the Crystal
    Desert.\n\n### Mioar\n\nThe Mioaran Plate, in the southern hemisphere, has no
    large portions\nthat aren't submerged. Still, its abundance of islands and archipelagos\ncombine
    to make up over 15% of Matar's total landmass. It was long\nthought these islands
    had been discovered and first settled by the\n[Brutor Tribe](5xBrtZyeYfTxWkZTO1o5zg)
    when they were still a sub-clan of the\nStarkmanir Tribe. Though no one questions
    that the Mioaran islands\nare Brutor tribal lands, recent archeological finds
    have given credence\nto oral histories of the highly nomadic [Thukker Tribe](3uoxvtJY1Z30BoVwuJLj2z).\nThese
    histories suggest that the\nThukker originated on these islands, having left long
    before the Brutor\narrived. Berrahem, once the largest of the Brutor cities, lies
    on the\nSouthern coast of the largest island in the Mioar archipelago, Mahj. At\none
    time, it sat in the middle of a huge web of rails that the Brutor\nconstructed
    both above ground and under. This rail system connected many\nof the Mioar islands,
    and was destroyed during the\n[Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) occupation. Today,
    small sections of this\nsystem have been refurbished, mostly as heritage sites
    designed to\nremind the Minmatar of their former glory.\n\nOceans\n------\n\nWith
    the four continents fairly stacked on top of each other on one side\nof the planet,
    and a large ocean on the opposite side, it is plain to\nsee why the Minmatar named
    it the 'Great Wet Desert.' They made very few\ndistinctions in terms of parts
    of the ocean, aside from the channels and\nstraits that separate the various landmasses.\n\nOrbital
    Bodies\n--------------\n\n### Asteroid Belt 1\n\nOrbiting at a mere 150km from
    Matar, this asteroid belt consists of\nveldspar and scordite. It has an orbit
    period of three days.\n\n### Moon I\n\nThe moon of Matar is fairly small with
    a radius of 132km. It has an\norbit radius of almost 450 million kilometers and
    an orbit period of 17\ndays.\n\n### The Eternal Flame\n\nAt a distance of 1.3
    AU from Matar is a statue named \"The Eternal\nFlame.\" Built by the government
    shortly after the formation of the Minmatar Republic, the massive sculpture is
    meant to symbolize the everlasting passion and resilient spirit of the Minmatar
    people. In particular, it has come to stand for the determination of the Minmatar
    to remain free and liberate all of their people from slavery.\n\nThe Eternal Flame
    was constructed at some distance from Matar, evidently upon the remains of an
    old asteroid colony of some kind. Persistent rumor and speculation suggests this
    was an ancient Minmatar Empire station that once orbited Matar but the evidence
    for this romantic suggestion is scarce. Some even claim it is older still despite
    the total lack of supporting evidence. \n\nSuch remains as have been discovered
    at the core of the foundation asteroid are a mix of Minmatar and Amarr technology,
    and suggest it was established during the occupation period. Some have claimed
    the old structure was actually a pirate base though most prefer to believe it
    was a secret rebel outpost. Perhaps such distinctions are moot when considering
    the times in which it was apparently used.\n\nPossible Former Orbital Bodies\n--------------\n\n###
    The Harvested Moon\n\nThere is much evidence to suggest that the planet originally
    had two\nmoons, though Amarr records make clear there was only one moon upon\ntheir
    arrival. Many Minmatar legends recount the harvest of Matar's\nsmallest moon during
    their first short period of space exploration.\nWhether or not the asteroid belt
    that currently orbits the planet\nrepresents the remnants of this moon remains
    controversial. Perhaps more\ncontroversial is the theory that the harvesting of
    this moon led to\ntidal disruptions responsible for the climate changes the planet
    seemed\nto be experiencing around the time of first contact with the Amarr.\n\n###
    The Pre-Collapse Station\n\nThe accounts in Minmatar legend of a station orbiting
    Pator IV and\npredating the Minmatar civilization may also be true. No definitive\nevidence
    has been found, although enigmatic references in the Amarr\nrecords of the conquest
    of Matar seem to confirm its existence at that\ntime. While there is speculation
    that the sculpture named the Eternal\nFlame\" is constructed of this station's
    remains, no empirical evidence\nhas been shown and these claims are widely regarded
    as romantic\nconjecture on the part of the artist.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n-   [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp)\n-
