- body: '**Nanolysins** are nano-machines designed to attack the cell membranes

    of organic materials.


    Operation

    ---------


    Each individual machine has a net charge which, when exposed to

    electrical current, causes them to align with each other so quickly that

    they behave like flechettes, shredding anything in their path.


    General usage

    -------------


    Although they would have to be produced by the hundreds of trillions to

    create a pandemic effect, nanolysins are banned by numerous

    international arms treaties and are classified as a WMD. They are

    extremely expensive to produce and lethal to handle unprotected.
