- body: '**Neuro-embryonic containment fluid** is the substance inside of

    [pods](capsule-lore) that protects the

    [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ). In addition to providing biological

    sustenance and a natural hyperconductor of brain wave electrical

    activity, the fluid contains unique graviton induction/convergence

    properties that, when combined with the inner-capsule shell membrane,

    behaves as an inertia dampener, allowing the pilot to perform high-G

    maneuvers in space.
