    Little knowledge survived on this world after the collapse of the [EVE Gate](2z1KQXUVtPP1WmlwcJaX4o).


    The planet is warm and comfortable, with a short year. It is not

    particularly mineral rich, though it does possess several large deposits

    of precious metals and other natural resources.


    The planet''s biosphere was early in its life cycle, having only recently

    transitioned from a cold, ice-covered world as its star''s surface

    temperature rose. Plant life had emerged within recent history,

    providing the planet with a breathable atmosphere, but having not yet

    given rise to large animal populations.


    It seems likely that the original settlers were primarily interested in

    colonization rather than short-term exploitation of the planet.
