    descent, she lived on the station for the majority of her life, but moved away
    in her last years. An old acquaintance, experiencing supposed malfunctions with
    his ocular implant that manifested as spectral images, saw her sitting across
    from him suddenly in a diner. She conversed briefly with the old man, who believed
    she must be dead and attempted but failed to flag down the waitress, Madame [Joraa](3pyB8eXdkI5yUVfcf5PgwS).
