- body: '**Self-flagellation** is practiced by some [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo).

    These days the church does not openly encourage the practice, but does

    not frown upon it, either. Numerous officials at the Imperial Court can

    at times be seen walking very gingerly through the courts after a night

    of, as it were, self-abuse.
