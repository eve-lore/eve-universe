- body: '**Chalmers** was an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) mercenary. In his last
    mission, he was part of a force that attempted to displace a group of backward
    Amarr settlers from a mineral rich valley on a planet in contested space.


    Final mission and death

    -----------------------


    He seemed to have a clowning personality, and made an off-hand joke during an
    important business meeting related to the mission. Chalmers, along with the rest
    of the mercenary group, was captured while on the planet by the settlers, who
    were revealed to be part of a [Sani Sabik](TDJbDXVg3cRp4b6FEkkFS)-influenced cult.


    During a sermon, Chalmers was tied to a stake and offered a chalice of blood to
    drink. Like the others, he refused the drink, but he also spat on the priest and
    then struggled against his bindings. He was taken out of the room and hooked up
    to a machine which slowly [drained](5UHvE5Sg9PIgO0JfgIkMqa) him of his blood until
    he expired. Later, his blood was offered to his fellow mercenaries as the priest
    attempted to convert them to their faith.
