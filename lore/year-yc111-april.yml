    Settlements\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n
    The continuing impact of the\ncluster-wide emergence of wormholes on [New\nEden's](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk)
    populace was reflected in early\nApril with reports of multiple 'wormhole cults'
    spreading throughout the\nempires. Varying from [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
    heterodox and schismatic\nsects to [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) radical
    nature-worship cults,\nthe many hundreds of groups springing up in response to
    the wormholes\nappeared entirely spontaneous and unconnected to one another.\n\nDespite
    mixed reactions among the [Minmatar Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) and [Thukker
    Tribe](3uoxvtJY1Z30BoVwuJLj2z) populations regarding the union of the\nThukker
    with the Republic, the overall response to the development\nappeared to be quietly
    positive. In particular, the Thukker were\nimpressed by the swift and decisive
    action of\n[Sanmatar](180IYq6xQy0PzfGH6hLEuO) [Shakor](3H5EVyO9kiyIUOEELIqOlV)
    over\nthe missing, and subsequently lost, Lakat-Hro Great Caravan. Even so,\nmany
    Thukker voices emphasized that their traditional autonomy had to be\nmaintained
    at all costs.\n\nThe successes of the Caldari offensive in the militia warfare
    zone\ncovering Black Rise and neighboring regions appeared to be emboldening\nlarge
    numbers of Caldari to settle in the newly-opened region. A [House of Records](6JvE4aPaJ3FcJ1dZPhFfES)
    report showed that the numbers\nof colonists moving to Black Rise had more than
    doubled in the first\nmonths of the year. With megacorporations such as\n[Kaalakiota](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK)
    and [Lai Dai Corporation](5k5GiWRlFceyTjLSz71XT) committed to large-scale projects,\nand
    a myriad independent ventures springing up in their wake, the\nCaldari spirit
    of expansion seemed in full flow. In contrast to this,\nthe [Federation Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1)
    was forced into a\nhumiliating cancellation of its \"search and recovery\" mission
    in [Black Rise](black-rise), terminating \"Operation Justice's Reach\" in\na response
    to the reality of Caldari occupations and continuing gains in\nthe Verge Vendor
    and Placid regions.\n\nIshukone Succession Decided\n---------------------------\n\nWith
    Ishukone stock having fallen sharply\nat the end of March, apparently due to investor
    concerns over perceived\nindecision regarding the appointment of a new CEO, the
    matter of the\nleadership of Ishukone Corporation became urgent in April. One
    sign of\nthe interest taken in the matter by State Executor [Tibus Heth](6E1MZyo3l7DscBmmOdp7KG)
    was the meeting held between Haatakan\nOiritsuu, former Kaalakiota CEO and special
    envoy for Heth, and Soisonen\nOkalala, the [Minedrill](2cjgnHBuWiKY7pH2xjzvG0)
    CEO contending for the\n[Ishukone](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI) CEO position with Mens\nReppola
    of [Ishukone Watch](21GQBhNgawJQQ39wqVX4yU). Some days later,\nOkalala visited
    the Landfall Shrine on New Caldari and spoke about the\nissues concerning Ishukone.
    He was also able to declare that the\nIshukone board had informed him and other
    Ishukone subsidiary CEOs that\na decision on the megacorporation CEO spot would
    come \"within the next\ntwo weeks.\"\n\nWith the contest between Okalala and Reppola
    stepping up a gear, a major\npanic was caused by the sudden collapse of Ishukone
    board member Natasha\nOgemi at her home. The news of Ogemi's collapse sparked
    a rush to sell\nIshukone stock as investors panicked, presumably believing that
    the\nIshukone CEO appointment process would be further delayed. The Ishukone\nboard
    responded by calling an emergency meeting at the Malkalen\nheadquarters of the
    megacorporation the following day. Mens Reppola and\nSoisonen Okalala were called
    to the meeting amid speculation that the\nboard was to act decisively to appoint
    a new CEO. Reppola announced that\nhe had personally purchased a five percent
    stake in Ishukone before\nleaving for the meeting. As Ishukone stock once more
    rebounded,\nReppola's enormous personal investment appeared to be his final move
    in\nthe contest for the CEO position.\n\nHours later, after the emergency board
    meeting, Mens Reppola emerged as\nthe new CEO of the Ishukone Corporation. The
    Ishukone Watch CEO\nsucceeded to the post with all board members voting in his
    favor,\nincluding Natasha Ogemi from her hospital bed. Reppola pledged to steer\nIshukone
    on a course honoring 'the legacy of Otri Gariushi.' He\nemphasised the strong
    culture of innovation and technological\ndevelopment at Ishukone, while also pledging
    to seek new markets and\nabandon protectionism. Reppola also called on the Ishukone
    board to\nencourage employee investment in the megacorporation and release\ntwo-thirds
    of the shares under board control for purchase by Ishukone\nworkers. His declared
    vision was one of corporate citizenship and stock\nownership going hand-in-hand.\n\nThe
    reaction of State Executor Tibus Heth to the appointment of Mens\nReppola as Ishukone
    CEO remained unknown with a distinctly muted\nreaction from the Caldari Providence\nDirectorate.
    However, the\nProvists also had to contend with mixed reactions, and some opposition,\nto
    their planned military reforms. Set against a background of large\ncosts from
    occupying [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i), the\nreform plans aimed at
    further modernizing the [Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN) and Army while
    centralizing the military\nchain of command. The Patriot bloc corporations were
    quick to back the\nplan, most notably the dynamic Lai Dai Corporation, but indications
    of\nPractical faction opposition caused some concern to the CPD. The\nopposition
    of the Liberal megacorporations, Ishukone and Hyasyoda, was\nexpected but with
    Practicals unenthusiastic it seemed as if the reforms\ncould be watered down or
    even blocked.\n\nEmpire and Mandate\n------------------\n\nIn the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo),
    the [Imperial Navy](3PKvXZS0iHKIgAmO9np74g)\nannounced its decision to withdraw
    from W-space exploration, citing a\nlack of immediate threat and declaring the
    wormholes to be a matter of\nscientific interest rather than military concern.
    The Navy went on to\nurge loyalist capsuleers to continue exploration efforts
    on behalf of\nthe Empire. Cynics might have observed that the Imperial Navy had
    taken\nunknown losses in its encounters with [Sleeper Drones](sleepers) in W-space
    and was simply choosing\nto offload dangerous and costly work onto capsuleer paramilitaries.\nHowever,
    in the Amarr Empire at least, such thoughts went unspoken.\n\nMeanwhile, in the
    [Ammatar Mandate](4BV4ldw5RdVB4FxKctn4J6), the\n[Ardishapur Family](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO)
    announced a major\npackage of aid and reconstruction to be implemented in the
    Derelik\nregion. The multi-trillon ISK package, announced by Ardishapur finance\ncheif
    Adreyi Ezion, aimed to 'bring the region up to par with other\nregions of the
    Empire in terms of piety, learning, health and economy.'\nCommentators suggested
    that the package was probably the largest ever\ninitiated in the Empire in terms
    of its scope and financial backing. The\ndesire of [Yonis Ardishapur](4Tb1Uk75SycuFuiizODkZD)
    to transform\nthe Mandate from a neglected fringe province to a 'vital node' of
    the\nEmpire seemed clear.\n"
