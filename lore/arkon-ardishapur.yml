- body: '**Arkon Ardishapur** was the head of the [Ardishapur Family](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO)
    who moved their residence to [Arzad II](3GU5GnnzvXqLbJNLd2Otoi) in order to bring
    the word of the

    Amarr Scriptures to his [Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw) subjects there.


    While interrogating three slaves suspected of fomenting rebellion, his

    own trusted slave servant - who was secretly involved as well - murdered

    him with his scepter to avoid being uncovered, and fled.


    Arzad II was bombed by his son [Idonis](2ZNvkPaPzpj4IaVpL2vWK3) in

    retaliation, but this failed to diffuse the situation. The scepter,

    which had been a symbol of the Emperor''s will, became much replicated by

    slaves leading up to the [Minmatar Rebellion](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N) and were
    known as the Khumaak

    in honor of Arkon''s killer, [Drupar Maak](4jYB1gA3QgB54Pi5vxP3Em).
