    beacon in the darkest days of a fledgling [Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp).
    Its shining light, a research facility to rival even the best the Federation had
    to offer, was to be an incubator for Minmatar talent, a place where scientists
    would have the tools and the support to compete on a cluster-wide scale. \"Home-grown
    technology by Minmatar, for Minmatar\" quickly became a part of the company's
    buoyant rhetoric. Whether it was true or not was of little consequence; the slogan
    made for great PR. Media outlets scrambled to profile the company, politicians
    lauded its vision, and celebrities lined up to endorse products that were years
    away from a production line.\n\nThe board of directors included members from all
    major tribes. Not only was this group a representative mix designed to underscore
    the endeavor\u2019s patriotic significance, but they were also proved to be the
    single largest contributing factor to the near demise of the company. From the
    very beginning, petty rivalries and selfish ambitions divided the board members,
    each of whom attempted to use the company to further personal or political agendas.
    Time and money were wasted in pursuing pet projects and pipe dreams with no demonstrable
    commercial application. Their favoritism slowly turned the research teams against
    one another, as the teams pandered to the whims of upper management in order to
    secure funding or gain access to limited resources.\n\nYears later, the company
    had still not produced a single successful product line. Minor breakthroughs were
    quickly undermined by cheaper or better offerings from more established competitors,
    while half-baked research projects and experimental prototypes languished as resources
    dwindled. Only one single team, a small group of [Sebiestor](sebiestor) researchers,
    managed to make any meaningful progress. Working on what was considered by many
    to be a dead-end project, the team survived because they were low cost and relatively
    self-sufficient. With the company on the verge of bankruptcy, the board, ignoring
    protests from the research team, ordered an immediate demonstration of the technology,
    which was a selective catalytic process that, when applied to compatible technologies
    such as shield boosters produced significantly higher yields without consuming
    the catalysts themselves. The board was attracted to the prospect of a technology
    that could turn the company's fortunes around.\n\nSpearheaded by the technology,
    now refined, patented, and mass produced, Boundless Creation slowly found its
    way to profitability. Strategic partnerships emerged that allowed the company
    to establish itself as the primary supplier of ship subsystems to the [Republic
    Fleet](2c4ZwKPnuW6mYkLJ2dGh94). Its patented predictive location algorithm is
    still regarded as the de facto industry standard. The algorithm is used in most
    modern tracking processors.\n\nIn the years since, Boundless Creation has established
    itself as one of the cornerstones of the Republic's financial resurgence. A stable,
    if somewhat unexciting, company that has never achieved the heights first envisioned
    years ago, the company is one that has inadvertently become the standard bearer
    for one of the Minmatar peoples' most defining characteristics: unyielding determination.\n\n\n###See
