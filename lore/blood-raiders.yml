    the cluster, second in most people\u2019s eyes only to the never-ending scourge
    of Sansha\u2019s Nation, the Blood Raider Covenant has gained a reputation as
    one of the most savage forces an individual can cross paths with in New Eden.
    It is a particularly well-known sect of an ancient cult by the name of [Sani Sabik](TDJbDXVg3cRp4b6FEkkFS),
    which literally translates to \u201Cblood seed.\u201D Under the leadership of
    the legendary Sabik priest [Omir Sarikusa](6UYaNpBPqY1ls1ps78PPPt), they have
    made their way into the minds of the general populace as perennial bogeymen, people
    of tainted minds and ghastly appetites.\n\nThe Sani Sabik cult first appeared
    thousands of years ago on Amarr Prime as a schismatic sect of the Amarrian faith,
    long before the advent of space travel. This sect\u2019s guiding belief was that
    some people were born for greatness, and other people lived only to breed and
    serve these exalted few. To this, they added the obsession with eternal life that
    permeates the upper tiers of the Amarrian elite, and the result was a cult so
    pervasive and destructive that Amarrian religious authorities immediately stamped
    down on it. Depleted but not defeated, the sect lived on in the shadows, every
    so often mutating itself anew. Today the cult exists in a multitude of independent
    sects throughout the Amarr Empire, with some even having moved their business
    to other empires or out into neutral space.\n\nAt some undocumented point in their
    history, the Sani Sabik began using blood in their rituals, and though each of
    the different sects of the cult varies in their rituals and doctrine, blood is
    always the focal point of their search for immortality. A few sects have taken
    \u201Cblooding\u201D\u2014as they call the draining of blood from a body\u2014to
    new heights. Rumors exist of \u201Cblood farms,\u201D where people are kept against
    their will, their blood regularly harvested. Other stories tell of sects that
    engage in necrophilic and even cannibalistic activities. As little is known of
    the inner workings of most of the sects, it is difficult to say whether these
    stories are true or just urban legends.\n\nBefore Omir Sarikusa took leadership
    of the covenant, the sect was already infamous for killing children, who were
    considered to have \u201Cpurer\u201D blood. Omir added to this practice by beginning
    to target those who were [clones](5y5CUyA9h4xXY40dInhn3o), believing their blood
    better suited for their arcane blood rituals.\n\nIn their search for cloned people,
    Omir\u2019s sect has taken to space. In the time since, their frequent attacks
    on passenger ships and other space vessels have made them feared and hated across
    the entire cluster. While the fact that they originated within the Amarr Empire
    is still a sore point for the Amarr (and rarely brought up in conversation), the
    covenant do not return the Amarr\u2019s hatred. Instead, they are inclined to
    view them as believers who have been led astray, faithful who could realize their
    true potential if they could only accept the true uncompromising and savage nature
    of their own faith.\n\nThe fact is that the Sani Sabik doctrine still shares a
    substantial number of beliefs with the Amarrian faith. It simply applies a different
    approach, paying particular attention to a number of scriptural passages that
    the Amarr would just as soon gloss over."

- body: '## History


    Under Sarikusa''s rule, the Blood Raiders went from targeting children for their
    blooding rites to targeting [clones](5y5CUyA9h4xXY40dInhn3o) individuals. Because
    so many [pod pilots](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) are clones, the Blood Raiders have
    begun piracy in order to capture them. They are utterly ruthless in obtaining
    the precious red, regularly boarding other spacecraft and abducting all aboard;
    some sects prefer to process their "donors" aboard the captured ships instead.
    They refer to the [Sisters of EVE](77ihwsVRHRojCaPC5XZn2g) as "little hunters"
    and often follow their movements to be directed towards the nearest disaster.
    From their base in Delve they launch lightning raiding parties and surprisingly
    well co-ordinated incursions deep into empire space in pursuit of their goals.


    During [Dochuta Karsoth''s](1qDadkKQ3HzwYZpl2r4JLL) corrupt rule of the [Amarr
    Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo), he was in contact with the Raiders and employed
    them for various illicit projects. Karsoth apparently approved of Raider philosophy
    to the point that he sent them various Amarr emissaries, including [Antar](1Hsjz0jFxyOlxJm9FhkcLv).
    Following [Jamyl I''s](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L) return, Karsoth fled to the Blood
    Raiders and hid among them. He was later recaptured by the Amarr Empire.


    The Blood Raiders were both terrified and enraged by the return of [Jamyl Sarum](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L),
    and vexed that their dealings with [Chamberlain Karsoth](1qDadkKQ3HzwYZpl2r4JLL)
    did not come to fruition. During the reign of Empress Jamyl I they appeared politically
    uninterested in the affairs of the Amarr Empire or the [heirs](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh),
    at least to the casual eye. However, there was an upswing in Blood Raider incursions
    along the empire''s borders in the Bleak Lands and Devoid regions.'

- body: "## Culture\n\n![Blood Raiders ritual](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/7mWCKcwP2K7NqzQNYFJu05/f5ade0c7dfc2b82087abdcc5cf6e0282/BloodRaiders.png)\n\n\u201CWe
    will eat the body and sanctify its blood, to let it be born\nagain.\u201D\n\nBlood
    is a cornerstone of the Sani Sabik religion and, to them, just as potent as the
    seal of the imperial family is to the Amarr. It serves several uses among the
    Sani Sabik, mainly in medical processes that improve quality of life in a myriad
    of ways. It is also seen as a symbol of good health, strength, and moral endurance
    against corrosive philosophies.\n\nThose who follow the Sabik faith wear necklaces
    with golden vials. Many adorn their walls with the same golden vials, decorated
    with silver droplets. It should be noted that, as with many other religiously
    symbolic items, these icons symbolize not only an entity but an event. In the
    Sani Sabik\u2019s case, that entity is the blood, which they worship and hold
    sacred\u2014but they also have an occult appreciation for the act of bloodletting
    itself.\n\nThe golden vial around a worshiper\u2019s neck is thus a symbol that
    she will always be safe, because she has a symbolic cache of blood if it should
    ever be needed; it also reminds the wearer that the blood had to be taken from
    somebody else. This reinforces to the Sani Sabik that they must always remain
    vigilant, active, and aggressive in the pursuit and preservation of their faith.
    This does not mean they see themselves as barbarous\u2014it is merely that their
    culture leaves little space for flexibility, doubt, or second thoughts.\n\nThe
    Sani Sabik universally believe in the Red God. He is particularly unforgiving
    of any transgressions. Part of the reasoning behind the Red God\u2019s name is
    obvious, but he is not only associated with blood; the redness can symbolize anything
    from a sunrise to the heart of an explosion. He symbolizes life, rejuvenation,
    and strength on the one hand, and the forces of destruction, anger, vengeance,
    and death on the other. This multifaceted symbolism is important to the Sani Sabik
    as a culture, because they are one of the few factions in New Eden distinguished
    primarily by religion, and as such, their religion has to have the capability
    to suffuse every part of their daily lives. If it didn\u2019t, they would long
    since have lost cohesion, no doubt devolving and splintering into estranged, isolated
    cults.\n\nTheir burial rites include writing the names of the deceased in the
    Books of the Dead. This register is part of a burial ceremony that dates back
    over a thousand years, though in modern times the physical book has been replaced
    with an enormous digital archive which is stored at the headquarters of the covenant.\n\nThe
    condition of the entry of one\u2019s name into the Books of the Dead is seen as
    both a promise and a threat. The promise is that you will never be forgotten by
    the society to which you devoted your life. This goes some way toward assuaging
    the doubts of those people who follow the secular rules of the faction but can\u2019t
    quite find it in their hearts to truly believe in the more intangible and fantastical
    parts of the religion.\n\nWhatever else happens, so long as the Sani Sabik live
    on, a devotee\u2019s name will not be forgotten. This is a constant encouragement
    for her to do her part in keeping the faith alive. The threat, likewise, is that
    if one strays from the path, her crimes will affect both her own legacy and the
    lives of those she leaves behind. While it is not a given that a particular crime
    will directly result in a devotee\u2019s death, if a crime is serious enough for
    the Sani Sabik to consider striking someone out of the Books of the Dead, it can
    safely be assumed that death is waiting for that individual in the very near future.\n\nFamily
    members of those refused entry or struck from the Books of the Dead may have only
    the most basic funeral service. Other benefits as fundamental as education and
    medical aid are refused to them, however, on the basis that they are tainted by
    association. As it usually leads to either self-imposed exile or ignoble suicide,
    this type of shunning is applied only in extreme cases.\n\nThe vast majority of
    Sani Sabik are not directly involved with the harvest of blood, bloodletting in
    general, or the hunting and sacrifice of cloned individuals. They are aware that
    certain practices are carried out in the name of science and religion, but those
    things tend to happen far away, to unnamed people, and the benefits, while vague
    and kept relatively secret, are reaped through the remarkable self-sufficiency
    of the Sani Sabik, who very rarely need to trade with outside entities.\n\nThe
    Blood Raiders in particular spend relatively little of their energies on raising
    crops and feeding their people, having found sustenance through the very fluid
    that gives them life. In fact, this autonomy and the resulting isolation have
    perpetuated the common image of the Blood Raiders as monsters. Since the other
    factions only interact with their bloodletting pirate crews and have no inkling
    of the cult\u2019s true society, they fear and demonize the Sani Sabik at every
    turn."

- body: "## Science\n\nIn their isolation from their imperial brethren, the Sani Sabik
    have made amazing advances in the scientific research of blood plasma in various
    fields related to decomposition, rejuvenation, organ transplantation, and organ
    cultivation. Over the centuries they have developed intimate knowledge of the
    workings of the human body, though unlike other factions they\u2019ve focused
    almost solely on biological aspects rather than delving into the arena of cybernetics.\n\nThe
    Blood Raider Covenant in particular is a perfect example of how far they\u2019ve
    come biologically, with the average citizen living well past the age of 180. Far
    from being naive or careless with their knowledge, the covenant closely guards
    the secrecy of its medical advances. It is believed that aside from improving
    the nutrient and oxygen delivery of human blood, the Sani Sabik have been able
    to vastly improve the human immune system, altering its characteristics to breed
    far more physiologically robust members of society through the manipulation of
    blood on a cellular level. Many believe that this is the primary reason for their
    interest in the blood of children and clones, with the Sani Sabik finding it far
    more potent in nature for experimentation.\n\nThe Blood Raider Covenant\u2019s
    elite combat units are known as the Crimson Paladins. Those who have faced off
    against these foes and survived have come back with stories that lead many to
    believe the potential benefits of blood cell manipulation are wide and varied,
    with added strength, endurance, and immune function coming from the regular transfusion
    of cultivated and purified blood. This is also believed to be a contributing factor
    as to why the Blood Raider Covenant in particular, among all the Sani Sabik, has
    had continued success: its invasion teams are extremely difficult to deal with,
    given their perfectly conditioned physiology, and are probably surpassed only
    by the biomechanical army of Sansha\u2019s Nation.\n\nA hardy, self-sufficient
    people by the very nature of their faith, the Sani Sabik have also made leaps
    and bounds in optimizing lower-grade blood to provide simple sustenance, using
    various scientific means of coagulation to mass produce highly nutritious blood-based
    foodstuffs for their growing flock."

- body: "## Structure and Leadership\n\nThe Blood Raider Covenant is structured as
    a strictly hierarchical society. Religious tenets and rituals surrounding the
    use of blood are a part of daily life within the covenant, having arguably more
    of an effect on the everyday lives of followers than the church has in the Amarr
    Empire.\n\nThe arch and enigmatic Omir Sarikusa, known to many as \u201CBloody
    Omir,\u201D has led the Blood Raiders since YC 84. In that time he has transformed
    them from a rabble of disjointed worshipers into one of the most powerful pirate
    organizations in New Eden. He remains to this day one of CONCORD\u2019s ten most
    wanted and sits at the top of similar lists within the Amarr Empire, the Khanid
    Kingdom, and the Ammatar Mandate.\n\nBehind him sits a trusted group of his closest
    allies, many of whom date back to his seizure of command a little over three decades
    ago. The vast majority of the organization outside the simple clergy of the Sani
    Sabik revolves around the Bleeders, a force that serves a combination of law and
    religious enforcers. Commanding respect from the general population of the covenant,
    Bleeders possess a higher degree of freedom than any other under the Sani Sabik
    faith, often conducting some of the more unpalatable aspects of their profession
    behind closed doors.\n\nWhile not a secret police as such, the Bleeders deal with
    every aspect of life among the Sani Sabik, acting as undertakers, religious advisers,
    midwives, and priests, with an overshadowing presence and quiet dignity about
    them. They are held in the highest of confidence by members of their communities,
    though this is usually tempered by a very real aura of danger.\n\nWhile one may
    confess his problems and worries to a Bleeder, or even petty sins, one would not
    be so bold as to reveal the nature of any serious crimes against the faith or
    another follower for fear of swift and brutal retribution. Bleeders also take
    their names from one of their oldest responsibilities: ensuring that every follower
    donates blood on a regular basis in order to aid with rescue work, religious ceremony,
    the upkeep of the Hematology Advancement Program, and, on occasion, further scientific
    research. Those who do anger the Bleeders by committing a crime or a great sin
    more often than not find themselves\u2014or various parts of themselves\u2014used
    for live experimentation.\n\nAs a society, the Blood Raider Covenant are fiercely
    proud of their independent way of life. Not unlike Sansha\u2019s Nation, they
    are a society that was left to fend for themselves, and found a way to thrive
    that made them the subject of hatred among the entire cluster. The covenant are
    well aware of this, and take a certain degree of perverse pride in it, although
    they do not truly consider themselves evil any more than anyone else does. The
    Sani Sabik feel that their present good fortune was hard won, against odds stacked
    very much against them.\n\nAmong their people, the practice of identifying and
    deifying savants has been part of Sani Sabik life for over a thousand years, but
    has in more recent times taken a back seat as the Blood Raiders in particular
    have widened their pursuits to the acquisition, inspection, and manipulation of
    blood, with this becoming their core focus. The only remaining echoes of the lauding
    of savants are in the near worship of Omir Sarikusa and in the unstated but general
    belief among the Sani Sabik that each and every one of them is a savant of New
    Eden, having all in one way or another been the beneficiaries of the blood rituals."

- body: "## Notable Characters\n\n### Omir Sarikusa\n\nBorn in late YC 47, Sarikusa
    belongs to a lineage that is a mixture of pure Amarr and Deteis ancestry. While
    his official history is littered with misdirection and shrouded in secrecy and
    mythology, it is known that he was born somewhere in the Bleak Lands region to
    a mother who was a high-class escort, and that early on in his childhood he displayed
    many sociopathic tendencies. When he was seventeen, he murdered the son of a wealthy
    holder. Realizing they could no longer protect him, his relatives gave him money
    and sent him off into the lawless territories of the Bleak Lands, where Amarrian
    authorities could not find him. The Blood Raiders found him instead.\n\nBy the
    time he reached the age of thirty, Omir had been inducted into the innermost ranks
    of the Blood Raiders and was considered a high priest. This gave him control of
    his own ship, which he used to raid not only nearby imperial territories, but
    also other sects of the Sani Sabik, his bloody and ruthless strikes gathering
    him much loyalty and many followers among the cultists in the area. Under the
    direction of his superiors, Omir eventually cowed these Sani Sabik sects, forcing
    them to assimilate into the covenant.\n\nOmir found himself increasingly distanced
    from his superiors and, after a failed assassination attempt against him was carried
    out on orders of the Blood Raiders\u2019 leadership, he engineered a coup. It
    was a bloody, vicious endeavor that earned him a fanatical following and a fearsome
    reputation. By the time YC 84 arrived, Sarikusa was the leader of the Blood Raider
    Covenant, at just thirty-seven years of age. Although his coup and the subsequent
    purge drastically reduced the numbers within the Blood Raiders, it meant that
    everyone who remained was fiercely loyal to his leadership and his cause. To this
    day he is revered among his followers, with millions swearing fealty to him.\n\n###
    Ahremen Arkah\n\nA woman of pure Amarrian blood born into the family of a wealthy
    holder in YC 44, Ahremen found herself in the Sani Sabik faith at the young age
    of twenty-two, swiftly defecting to the Bleak Lands to locate her kin.\n\nA leader
    of dizzying intellect and tremendous cunning, she has for the past three decades
    remained a fiercely loyal and devoted follower of Sarikusa. She is charged with
    the day-today military operation of the entire covenant, ensuring that Sarikusa\u2019s
    will is done.\n\n### Draclira Merlonne\n\nA certified sociopath and psychopath,
    Merlonne was born on Villore IV a little over four decades ago. After her mother
    died from complications during childbirth, and her father disowned her during
    her early teenage years due to her increasingly antisocial behavior, Draclira
    spent much of her early life locked away in a series of mental institutions within
    the Gallente Federation.\n\nAfter reaching the legal age for release, she ventured
    across the imperial border in search of the Blood Raider Covenant, vanishing for
    several years. Upon her reemergence, during an attack on a federal trade convoy
    in the system of Covryn, far outside the Blood Raiders\u2019 usual hunting grounds,
    she was elevated to the federation\u2019s top ten most wanted list, where she
    has remained since. Unpredictable, utterly psychotic, and fanatically loyal to
    the Blood Raiders, she has proven time and time again to be a highly capable pilot
    who will not hesitate to attack anyone she believes to be a threat to the covenant.\n\n###
    Raysere Giant\n\nIntaki by blood but Sabik to his core, Raysere was born on the
    Intaki home world in YC 49 and became embroiled in a life of crime from an early
    age. Part of a prison convoy traveling out of Intaki and destined for Oulley IV,
    Raysere was spared slaughter in YC 71 due to his bizarrely pale appearance and
    extreme height.\n\nAfter being introduced to the Sani Sabik faith, Raysere revealed
    a twisted and highly sadistic streak that earned him the nickname \u201Cthe Sick
    Giant.\u201D After serving a number of years as a Bleeder, he ascended to a position
    leading internal security operatives for the Blood Raider Covenant. Eventually,
    after siding with Sarikusa during his coup in YC 84, Raysere became the Blood
    Raider Covenant\u2019s head of Internal Security, the perfect position for a man
    with such a cruel, machinelike disposition.\n\n### Tairei Namazoth\n\nBorn on
    Oris in YC 77 as a member of a minor royal family, Tairei was cast out and exiled
    from her family at the age of twenty for the murder of her cousin during a minor
    family dispute. Reportedly she was discovered soaked in crimson, drinking from
    her deceased relative\u2019s slashed throat.\n\nShe lived in exile on the edge
    of the Bleak Lands for almost a decade, practicing the Sani Sabik faith in solitude
    before becoming personally involved with a Blood Raider scout, and being indoctrinated
    into the Blood Raider Covenant a little over a year later.\n\nToday Tairei serves
    as one of the most senior tactical commanders in the covenant, directly under
    the command of Omir Sarikusa and Ahremen Arkah. Described as a brutal, unforgiving
    commander who takes no prisoners, she is called on by the covenant whenever an
    issue requires a hard, swift resolution."
