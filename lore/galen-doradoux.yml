- body: '**Galen Doradoux** is a [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ). At one point
    he was in negotiations with members of the Vaarkota cartel in the [Xygia](3il5i5TcVobmo5ABWlm13q)
    system. The negotiations turned sour and Galen was podded.


    He woke up in his [clone](5y5CUyA9h4xXY40dInhn3o) a short time later with no major
    negative effects, and quickly signed a new clone contract with Vivant Clone Repositories
    for an up-to-date clone.
