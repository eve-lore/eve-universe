- body: '**Mountain Wind** is one of the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) spirits.


    Mountain Wind is the watcher of the skies and of the lands, swirling

    about the high peaks of world, carrying news of what he finds to the

    other spirits. Though a silent observer, when he speaks the other

    spirits listen, and Caldari would do best to listen as well; he does not

    waste words on trivialities. One Caldari folktale from the time just

    after contact with the Gallente describes him giving the first words of

    warning about the new visitors- "they come to tame the wind." Mountain

    Wind is also portrayed as the patron of scholars and historians, and has

    particular importance for the [Kaalakiota Corporation](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK),
    which is named for the towering mountains where the Caldari believe he is strongest.


    Other divine entities include

    [Wind-of-the-West](3FsbhfAVn48VZcWAXiTReI), [Cold Wind](16iSgSK58hOq8DIlx2oqKS),
    [Heart-of-the-Forest](3zH6qMixgVJtQUgHF3KFFM), and [Storm Wind](vAU7b4dGGPGQNp6QRw6mX).
