    and\n[Ammatar Governor](ammatar-governor). The office of\nEmperor has experienced
    many transformations in its history. It began as\na principate and transformed
    later to Caesaropapism. The time of the\nPrincipate was from AD 16470 to 21460,
    at this time the\n[Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) Emperor was the leader of the
    Apostles, the\nfirst among equals, and his authority was channeled through the
    [Council of Apostles](nTZLcvZprqLLUiGIaVQu7).\n\nAfter the [Moral Reforms](48nuiRGJ4i8BwACDI9a58u)
    the\nEmperors became more powerful as secular leaders and also as supreme\nheads
    of the church; it was the beginning of the modern emperors. The\nEmperor's authority
    is unquestioned and absolute, but the archaic and\nbureaucratic system of government
    \u2013 including a series of\nchecks-and-balances encountered both in the entrenched
    Empire\ninstitutions and in the rule of various local barons within the\nempire
    \u2013 makes it difficult for him to exert his rule unless\ndirectly in person.
    Otherwise, the Heirs rule in his name, dividing\nthe huge empire between them.\n\nThe
    closest that can be defined as his personal administrative body is\nthe [Emperor
    Family](IXrotYvoWOVnuGAMbbYEv). Realistically, the main\nsupport of an Emperor's
    power and authority is the military. Being paid\nby the imperial treasury, the
    soldiers ([Paladins](n1Ta6TQKn4vEKTzacqhVJ))\nalso swore an annual military oath
    of loyalty towards him.\n\nOn an imperial level, on the imperial court, the most
    powerful\nindividuals are the Chancellor, the Chamberlain, the Emperor Family,
    and\narguably the Ammatar Governor. In addition to the\n[imperial offices](6lg0vegSyiF2IoOlrq8bUT),
    the Privy Council exists as a major imperial decision-making body. In order to\nmaintain
    the administration's cohesion as a central body with the\nprovinces of the empire,
    the emperor relies on the Privy Council, which\nfunctions, among other things,
    as a place where the [royal families](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh)\nmeet the Emperor.
    The Privy Council\nitself is the highest administrative body in the Amarr Empire's
    civil\nhierarchy, forming the emperor's personal advisory council. In theory it\nis
    a gathering of the reigning emperor's most trusted advisors from\nvarious branches
    of government, assembling to offer advice and\nsuggestions for the emperor's consideration.\n\nSee
