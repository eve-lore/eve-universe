    [Everyshore](239UsWf0eflceZoW5SLYvE) region of the Federation. Their home

    planet, Mannar VIII, is now a barren wasteland, following an unspecified

    calamity.


    First contact with the Gallente was made 15 years after Gallente-Intaki

    first contact and today they are spread far and wide through

    Federation systems.


    Many modern Mannar associate with the Hawk political bloc of Federation

    politics, a group that advocates nationalistic attitudes and a

    militaristic approach to foreign policy.
