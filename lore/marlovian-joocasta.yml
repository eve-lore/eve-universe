- body: '**Marlovian Joocasta** is a beloved entertainer possibly best known for

    the [death](5WNhh1Tm9Ucm0ni1HgOotc) of his career. While popular in his

    earlier years, his work tapered off as he aged. In an effort to combat

    this he turned to [Vertan Nejowin](HXN0Wu61u9OaddvaouoRM) in the

    early days of face-swapping. Some security procedures were skipped over

    and some corners were cut with the result being Marlovian''s face melting
