- body: '**Permeation-proof (lightweight) armor** is a type of personal

    protective armor. It may be worn under clothing and protects the wearer

    from direct assault, though natural disasters are still a partial

    threat. Something heavy falling on the wearer is enough to rupture its

    defenses.
