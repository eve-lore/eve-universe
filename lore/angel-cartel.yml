- body: "## The Angel Cartel\n\nThe Angel Cartel is regarded by many law enforcement
    agencies as the most powerful and dangerous criminal organization in New Eden.
    The main reason for this assessment is the extent and scope of the cartel\u2019s
    criminal activities. While most of the major outlaw factions have operations spread
    throughout the cluster, the Angel Cartel is notable for the extent to which it
    has insinuated itself into the core empires, as well as its considerable interests
    in the outer regions. Few other criminal organizations, for example, could boast
    of strong links with the Minmatar underworld while at the same time illicitly
    supplying slaves to the less scrupulous holders of the Amarr Empire. When these
    interests are set next to the cartel\u2019s powerful presence in the Gallente
    illegal drugs market and the sinister tendrils it has inserted into the Caldari
    corporate world, it can be seen that the Angels\u2019 reach is long indeed.\n\nThe
    cartel has established itself as a power in the lawless outer regions, in particular
    the aptly named Curse region, where it controls numerous stations and colonies.
    The impressive military power of the cartel is perhaps most strikingly illustrated
    by the fact that it has an entire division, the Guardian Angels, dedicated to
    protecting the interests of its main partner in crime, the Serpentis Corporation.
    The connection with the Serpentis has served to give the Angels a permanent presence
    in the Fountain region, making the cartel one of the few criminal organizations
    to maintain major holdings outside its home region.\n\nThe Angel Cartel\u2019s
    reputation for ruthlessness and brutality has served to prevent interested parties
    from scrutinizing the organization\u2019s operations too closely, but those who
    have, perhaps foolishly, made it their business to study the cartel soon learn
    that it is more than a mere crime syndicate. The cartel has shown a marked interest
    in technologies new and ancient. It has made its headquarters in a region believed
    to have been the home of the First and Second Jovian Empires, and it typically
    discourages exploration and inquiry into its domains with a swift and absolute
    response. All this said, those students of the Angel Cartel who have survived
    long enough to put their thoughts on paper all agree on one point of note: the
    Angel Cartel seems to regard capsuleers as its greatest threat, not rival pirate
    groups and certainly not the old empires."

- body: "## History\n\n### Origins\n\nThe history of the Angel Cartel is shrouded
    in mysteries, rumors, and legends more contradictory and puzzling than most, but
    what is certain is that the cartel in its current form began to come together
    some time in the early period following the formation of CONCORD in BYC 3. Several
    accounts mention cartel operations in the Heaven constellation at this time, and
    the first mention of an \u201CAngel Cartel\u201D is dated to YC 4. It is assumed
    that the cartel chose its name in reference to the Heaven constellation that would
    become its headquarters.\n\nThe origins of the Angel Cartel prior to the first
    mention of its name are subject to much speculation and many conflicting theories.
    The most commonly accepted account is that the cartel began as a grouping of pirates
    and scavengers who aimed for and eventually achieved dominance over the lawless
    inhabitants of the Heaven constellation. The constellation, and the Curse region
    as a whole, had for a couple of centuries been one of the most attractive destinations
    for adventurers and freebooters from the core regions. \n\nOn the edges of the
    civilized world yet relatively accessible, Curse had much to recommend it to those
    of a mind to rove in search of a lucky strike\u2014or who, just as often, simply
    wished to prey on others at a comfortable distance from law and order. The presence
    of many ruins in the region also suggested the previous dominion of a powerful
    civilization, which some suspected to be a precursor of the recently revealed
    Jove Empire.\n\n### Minmatar Rebellion and Angel Dominance\n\nIt was not long
    after the first suspicions arose of a Jovian connection with Curse that the Minmatar
    Rebellion took place, an event which heralded a new influx of refugees, often
    heavily armed ones, into the region. All semblance of order rapidly broke down,
    as old scores were settled and new conflicts erupted. The most powerful groups
    began to band together in ever larger cartels and contended for supremacy over
    Utopia and the Heaven constellation.\n\nThe Angel Cartel in particular boosted
    its numbers so much that they went from controlling and developing the Utopia
    system and Heaven constellation to having an entire region at their mercy. Along
    the way they defeated other cartels who has sought to profit from the immigration,
    and absorbed others into their ranks.\n\nA few years after it coalesced, some
    ten years after CONCORD was founded, the Angel Cartel had achieved total control
    of Utopia and the surrounding systems. From that key position of power, it was
    not long before the Cartel became the unquestioned power in the Curse region.
    The Cartel however did not leave it at that. Their position of power began to
    attract outlaws from around New Eden, and likewise they sent out forces beyond
    their home. The Archangels division in particular was tasked with this and are
    still the most common one to meet outside of their home.\n\n### Amidst the Ruins
    of the Jove\n\nThe initial influx of adventurers to Curse was made up of Amarr
    explorers and renegades of one kind or another, and in sparse numbers at that.
    Nevertheless, it became clear that another civilization had relatively recently
    occupied the region. To the disappointment of prospective slavers, no remaining
    inhabitants were ever found, even where intact structures stood among the desolation
    of the rest of the region. In most cases nothing but rapidly crumbling ruins were
    found, as if the withdrawal of civilization itself had triggered a hasty decay.\n\nIn
    later decades, and particularly in the century before the Angel Cartel emerged,
    the population of scavengers and pirates making the Curse region their home became
    more varied, with many escaped Minmatar in particular choosing it as a hiding
    place from the wrath of the Amarr Empire. Nevertheless, the first Amarr explorers
    left their mark on the gateway constellation they called \u201CHeaven,\u201D and
    its systems retained the names the Amarr had bestowed on them. In the decades
    following Amarrian first contact with the Gallente and the Caldari, particularly
    adventurous or hunted individuals from those nations found Heaven an attractive
    destination. The first stations began to be built, with the Utopia system becoming
    the natural hub of the constellation. \n\nSoon after the Jove made themselves
    known to all the empires, the few remaining archaeological expeditions in the
    Heaven constellation came to the realization that the crumbling civilization that
    had once called the Curse region home had to be Jovian. Eventually evidence amassed
    that the ruins of the lost civilization in the Curse region were indeed Jovian,
    and that the artifacts recovered dated back to the First and Second Jove Empires.\n\nIt
    is to this day hard to say just how much the Angels uncovered, and they remain
    tight-lipped about their discoveries. Publicly they will often downplay the role
    that Jovian technology might have played in their own rise to power, but what
    is certain is that the design of their ships bears a remarkable resemblance to
    that of the Jove. However practically these hulls perform more alike to the Minmatar
    ships, being fast, agile and packing a lot of punch. \n\nIt is unclear if this
    ship design emphasis is a preference that has served the Angels well, or if they
    adapted what they knew due to a lack of actually valuable technology left behind.
    Alternatively, some have suggested that much Jove technology is likely so advanced
    the Angels were not able to even operate it. Suggesting this is far more upsetting
    to the Cartel than the implication that their technology is stolen.\n\n### Protection
    Pact with Serpentis\n\nIn the century since it achieved control of Curse, the
    Angel Cartel has rapidly grown in power and currently is, without question, the
    most feared criminal organization in New Eden. One of the organization\u2019s
    most important moments came in YC 75, when it struck a deal with the Serpentis
    Corporation to provide protection in exchange for access to Serpentis stations
    and research. \n\nThis deal turned out to be so mutually beneficial that the Guardian
    Angels, once tasked with R&D, became security specialists for the Serpentis Corporation
    and their former responsibilities were passed on to the Salvation Angels division
    instead. Stations were erected in each other's respective home regions as well,
    making it so that both are special in having stations not only at the heart of
    their seat of power but also on the other side of the cluster. This has given
    both organizations strategic advantages in having multiple staging points spread
    widely around the edges of the New Eden cluster.\n\nThe deal with Serpentis also
    brought the cartel into its first major conflict with another faction. Guardian
    Angel forces clashed with Mordu\u2019s Legion when the latter made an incursion
    into Serpentis Prime in YC 106. The incident is yet another unsolved mystery in
    the history of the cartel, but is speculated to have involved research into highly
    advanced technology.\n\n### Mordu's Legion Incursion\n\nIn YC106 it was Mordu's
    Legion that embarrassed the Guardian Angels when the former led an incursion into
    Fountain. Muryia Mordu himself led the operation, and Guardian Angel commanders
    Brynn Jerdola and Setele Schellan took to the field to chase him and his troops
    back out. The conflict had been a tactical cat and mouse game until they arrived.
    Even during the ensuring battle the Legion suffered only minimal losses and caused
    the Cartel forces to retreat and regroup. During this however Mordu ordered his
    own fleet to return home.\n\nIt is unknown if the Legion got what it came for
    or if they simply felt they were outnumbered in Serpentis home turf. Luckily for
    the Angels, it did not jeopardize their relationship with the Serpentis and the
    lessons learned from this incursion were put to use to strengthen the perimeter
    against any other unwanted invaders.\n\n### War with Sansha's Nation\n\nIn mid-YC
    108, the Angel Cartel found itself on the defensive against its longtime regional
    enemy Sansha\u2019s Nation, the latter based in the nearby Stain region. Major
    attacks by Sansha\u2019s Nation forces against cartel holdings in the Impass and
    Feythabolis regions marked not only an unusual resurgence in Nation activity but
    also an escalation of the two outlaw factions\u2019 rivalry into open war. The
    events of this period of warfare between the Angels and Sansha\u2019s Nation also
    saw an uncharacteristic reliance by the cartel on capsuleer allies. Speculation
    suggested that Sansha\u2019s Nation incursions into Cartel space were aiming to
    seize ancient technologies uncovered by the Angels.\n\nWhat is remarkable about
    this conflict is that the Cartel called upon the help of capsuleers to drive the
    invading forces back. Indeed it seems that Dominations diplomat [Xavier Khun](Xavier-Khun)
    had been in contact with the then sovereignty holding alliance [Ascendant Frontier](Ascendant-Frontier-(Player-alliance))\nfor
    a while already. Eager to prove their worth and might to both the Cartel and Nation,
    they deployed in full force alongside the Cartel.\n\nWhile at first it seems that
    the Nation had the upper hand, the capsuleers turned the tide and ultimately destroyed
    the Sansha's Nation fleet in full for only some minor losses. They even went as
    far as to take out the POS that the Nation had deployed as a staging base. While
    the conflict died down after that, the Angels maintain a very hostile attitude
    towards Sansha's Nation.\n\n### Infiltration of State and Republic\n\nTwo of the
    most notable incidents in recent history involving the Angel Cartel took place
    in YC 110. The first incident, in January of that year, was astonishing mainly
    for its revelation of the weakness of the Caldari State at the time, with Secure
    Commerce Commission investigators revealing evidence of the Angel Cartel\u2019s
    infiltration and financial backing of several Caldari corporations. The second
    incident demonstrated just how brazen the cartel could be, as it invaded and occupied
    the Skarkon system of the Minmatar Republic in May YC 110.\n\n#### Itsukame Scandal\n\nItsukame
    was a Caldari corporate start-up who made headlines in YC 109 when they subsequently
    poached high-profile researcher Dr. Grant Arataka from Lai Dai, and announced
    an important breakthrough in the use of unstable wormholes for transport technology.
    This attracted the attention of the SCC, as improving the capabilities of mobile
    jump-bridges is classified as military technology.\n\nDuring the routine work
    to grant Itsukame an exclusive patent to produce this technology it was found
    that they had received substantial financial aid from various corporations with
    ties to or acting as a front for the Angel Cartel. This further implied that the
    Cartel acted as a silent partner and that Itsukame was thus in part under their
    control. This is a direct violation of SCC regulations and led to an escalating
    court battle between the Caldari State and and the SCC.\n\nAfter seizing substantial
    amounts of data from Itsukame and an investigation that lasted well into YC 110,
    it was discovered that as much as twenty Caldari corporations were implicated.
    While most were small, Zainou Biotech was one big name that stood out. They however
    pointed out that anyone can invest in their publicly traded stock and that they
    were the victims here.\n\nContent with what they had still achieved, especially
    as this had put the State and CONCORD at odds, the Angels withdrew their money
    and shut down the uncovered fronts, no doubt sending everything right over to
    the next scheme.\n\n#### Skarkon Crisis\n\nShortly before the YC 110 collapse
    of the Minmatar Republic's government, the Archangels claimed democratic sovereignty
    over the Skarkon system. The Skarkon Crisis carried on throughout May and June,
    with the Minmatar Republic apparently powerless to do anything about the cartel\u2019s
    occupation.\n\nLocal inhabitants, indeed, appeared to favor the cartel both in
    their comments and in an apparently free and fair referendum held by the Angels.
    The inhabitants of Skarkon II, dissatisfied with the failing promises of the Midular
    government to 'clean up' this dangerous system, had sided with the Archangels
    in a ten million signatures petition, as well as during the system-wide referendum.
    Being so close to Curse, the Angels had evidently been growing their influence
    over the local population for a long time. \n\nThe Skarkon Crisis was one of several
    incidents cited during the vote of no-confidence in the emergency parliament session
    of the Republic called by Republic Parliament head Maleatu Shakor in June. Ultimately,
    coincidentally with the Starkmanir discovery, the Cartel withdrew with haste and
    informed CONCORD that all claims were now to be considered void and rescinded.
    While CONCORD now considered the situation resolved, many kept discussing what
    could have caused this strange turn of events. No official word by the Cartel
    was however given, they simply carried on their business as if they had gotten
    what they wanted out of the affair.\n\n### Recent Events\n\nToday, the Angel Cartel
    remains as powerful, fearsome, and enigmatic as it has been throughout its history.
    Few in New Eden will lightly cross the Cartel, and even the most capable criminals
    know better than to challenge its control of the black market throughout much
    of the cluster. Even so, it remains the case that perhaps the most disturbing
    aspect of the Cartel is its pursuit of hidden knowledge and lost technologies.
    The true purposes of the Cartel are as covert as the identities of its famously
    anonymous leadership."

- body: "## Culture\n\n![Angel Cartel member](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/7r0gkeMAtcEVBU1CSlRI8o/ecd82940d268d1d8c9668e9cea01954a/angel.png)\n\nThe
    Angel Cartel\u2019s culture famously emphasizes loyalty and discipline above all
    else. The absolute requirement of all Cartel members is that they act first and
    foremost in the interests of the cartel. Everything else, including their lives,
    is secondary to this, and deviations from cartel discipline are understood to
    be punished with implacable ferocity. So far as can be ascertained from the outside\u2014given
    that Cartel discipline includes the usual criminal code of silence enforced with
    unusual dedication\u2014the Angel Cartel\u2019s main divisions are organized in
    a quasi-military structure somewhat akin to the organizational framework adopted
    by guerrilla fighters. It is possible, indeed likely, that this came about under
    the influence of former Minmatar rebels who joined the organization.\n\nThe cartel
    is known to be unconcerned with the racial origin of its members, considering
    that anyone can join the Cartel as long as they accept its discipline. Anecdotal
    evidence suggests that the Cartel has a significant proportion of members from
    Amarrian and Minmatar bloodlines, but it is clear that its large membership includes
    many of Caldari and Gallente origin. From the evidence of recovered bodies, surveillance
    imagery, and the few known Angels captured alive, it has been established that
    the Cartel has a culture of tattooing where markings signify certain achievements,
    membership of subgroups, or ranks. This practice appears to be a very degraded
    form of Minmatar tattooing culture with, for instance, the commonality that the
    penalties for unearned tattoos are harsh.\n\nThe Angel Cartel is also known to
    have an extensive and rich slang that has to a significant extent influenced the
    slang of criminals across New Eden. In many places this slang has become a criminal
    lingua franca. The Angels have been heard to refer to themselves in rather exalted
    language as \u201CAngels of the Book,\u201D a reference that as yet remains an
    enigma but possibly refers to some internal code of honor. It is also true that
    the various divisions of the Cartel are competitive, and members have been recorded
    speaking of other divisions in mildly disparaging terms or by using diminutive
    nicknames, such as \u201CSalvies,\u201D for the Salvation Angels, or \u201CArseangels,\u201D
    for the Archangels. Competition between divisions, and within them between subgroups,
    appears to be a universal and essential part of the Cartel\u2019s operational
    culture.\n\nAs far as criminal activity is concerned, the Angel Cartel is indiscriminate.
    So long as an activity is illegal and can turn a profit, the Cartel will happily
    take its due part in it. Of note here is the very strong cultural prohibition
    against profiting from legal activity. This prohibition is so strong that it is
    one of the few details of Cartel culture to have been credibly established beyond
    all doubt. Full members of the Cartel apparently disdain legal commerce so strongly
    that it is against their code to engage in it. As a result, the Cartel has much
    expertise in corrupting and suborning others into carrying out such legal transactions
    as it finds necessary. The Cartel also appears to take delight in making apparently
    legal activities illegal through various devices, thereby allowing themselves
    to profit according to their codes of honor. The Cartel infiltration of various
    Caldari corporations in contravention of Caldari and CONCORD law is one such example.\n\nThe
    Angel Cartel is not above preying on other criminal organizations. Indeed, this
    is one of its major activities within the core empires, and there are relatively
    few underworld syndicates powerful enough to resist paying the Cartel its cut.
    The cartel has little inhibition when it comes to the damage its activities do
    to the law-abiding inhabitants of the cluster, appearing to regard noncriminals
    as implacably beneath it. Angel Cartel activities are known to include drug and
    weapon smuggling, slaving, piracy, colony raiding, and many other forms of large-scale
    criminality."

- body: "## Leadership\n\nThe Angel Cartel\u2019s top leadership is marked by one
    characteristic above all others: secrecy. The identities of those who sit at the
    top of the cartel, the supreme leaders of the Dominations division, are closely
    guarded. How many they number is unknown, although such investigations as have
    been carried out have strongly inferred that the leadership does number more than
    just one man or woman who wields all power. Even that inference may simply have
    been allowed to exist as yet another smokescreen. The truth is that very few people
    know the truth, and they are all among the cartel\u2019s most fanatically loyal
    members.\n\nAside from the Dominations, however, many divisional leaders and subcommanders
    can be found throughout the cartel\u2019s quasi-military structure. Every Angel
    answers to somebody who ranks higher in the organization and every Angel is to
    some extent trained to lead. This is not least because of the leadership role
    the Angels often arrogate to themselves in local criminal networks. The identities
    of those who administer the cartel's divisions\u2014such as Trald Vukenda of the
    Dominations\u2014are at least known, but it is certain they report to the hidden
    masters of the Angel Cartel.\n\nEven though its absolute nature is unique, the
    Angel Cartel\u2019s leadership practices secrecy that extends throughout all aspects
    of cartel operations and is a strong influence on the subsidiary leaders. An Angel
    Cartel subcommander will be a master of misdirection and subterfuge. Many are
    the law enforcement agents who have captured a local cartel \u201Cleader\u201D
    only to find they actually have a ridiculous dupe on their hands. The cardinal
    law of the cartel has also been seen to operate with total ruthlessness when a
    real leader has been captured. In almost every case, the cartel has successfully
    carried out assassinations of captured commanders or cell leaders they could not
    recover. Those few who the authorities have managed to protect have suffered mind
    wipes, apparently brought on by self-triggered hypnotic implantation. The Dominations
    know well that the oath of silence can not stand up to modern interrogation techniques
    and clearly demand special safeguards from their leadership cadres."
  id: 3i5oJOri18FMcQEyjmzQnn
  layout: default
- body: "## Structure\n\nThe Angel Cartel\u2019s overall structure is militaristic
    and hierarchical in nature, with several key divisions existing on a permanent
    basis to fulfill the main needs of the cartel, and a scattering of minor divisions
    for highly specialized purposes.\n\n### Archangels\n\nThe Archangels are the largest
    division of the Angel Cartel and are the most commonly seen in space. They constitute
    the main force taking part in piracy, smuggling, and raiding. Like all the main
    cartel divisions, the Archangels use a range of distinctive ships known throughout
    New Eden for speed, firepower, and durability. The novelty and uniqueness of cartel
    ship designs makes many wonder as to their origin, but the Archangels are certainly
    not revealing anything. Archangel installations can be found in Curse and Fountain,
    and their forces can be found patrolling twelve regions of south and east New
    Eden, from Feythabolis to Cache. The Archangels are so prevalent and large in
    size that some of their subdivisions, such as their Gistii fighters, have become
    well known.\n\n### Guardian Angels\n\nThe Guardian Angels are the next major division
    of the Angel Cartel, tasked with protecting Serpentis operations across New Eden
    but particularly in Fountain and the neighboring regions where Serpentis influence
    is felt most. Guardian forces are so closely integrated with the Serpentis Corporation\u2019s
    own formidable military that many who encounter them assume their forces to be
    part of the Serpentis organization. The relationship between the Angel Cartel
    and Serpentis is indeed very close, but the Guardian Angels\u2019 first loyalty
    is to the cartel. For their part, the Serpentis are under no illusions on this
    point. Guardian Angels are less wedded to the unique technologies used by the
    cartel than the Archangels and can often be seen using Serpentis equipment. This
    very likely stems from a combination of convenience and the cartel\u2019s typical
    reluctance to share its secrets, even with so close an ally as Serpentis.\n\n###
    Salvation Angels\n\nThe Salvation Angels are an old division of the cartel that
    trace their origins back to the scavenging days of the nascent Angel Cartel. A
    largely noncombat division, the Salvation Angels are nonetheless a key element
    in the cartel, responsible for building and maintaining ships, stations, and other
    facilities. The Salvation Angels are rather notorious within the cartel for their
    tendency to interfere with the operations of other divisions, but they are tolerated
    mainly due to their essential role. The division is responsible for all resource
    extraction, salvaging, and refining work, as well as logistics and supply for
    operations and installations. The Salvation Angels are also routinely involved
    in mop-up operations, where they salvage from the wrecks of friend and foe. Occasionally
    they live up to their name by rescuing survivors from the wrecks of cartel ships,
    another reason why other Angels tend to be more amused by the prying of the \u201CSalvies\u201D
    than anything else.\n\n### Dominations\n\nThe Dominations are the command division
    of the Angel Cartel and are both enigmatic and elusive. Dominations ships very
    rarely venture beyond their bases in Curse, though they do maintain a presence
    in the Phoenix constellation\u2014no doubt to keep an eye on both the Guardian
    Angels and the Serpentis. While the Dominations division evidently consists of
    an extensive staff, with several stations and a support fleet, the actual leaders
    of the Angel Cartel are never seen in person by anyone other than perhaps a select
    few personnel. Absolute secrecy as to the identities of the top leadership of
    the cartel has been maintained by the Dominations for a century. This secrecy
    naturally fuels speculation as to the cartel\u2019s true purposes. Whatever the
    reason for their fanatical devotion to hiding their identities, the Dominations
    leadership have no intention of allowing the veil to slip.\n\n### Other Divisions\n\nFrom
    time to time the cartel finds it convenient to set up other divisions for specific
    purposes. These divisions may or may not have formal names, but in general they
    report directly to the Dominations. It is possible that such divisions are either
    functionally named or perhaps are known by the name of their leader. Since many
    of these divisions are engaged in covert activity, it is likely that many are
    simply given code names.\n\n### Demographics\n\nRenegade Amarr and escaped Minmatar
    were amongst the first to join the ranks of the Angel Cartel and have always been
    prominent within it, but just as Curse has always had the interest of all the
    races so has the Cartel never discriminated in its recruitment. This has helped
    them to become the largest and most powerful criminal organization within New
    Eden, a status which its members wield with pride. \n\nIt is important to note
    that the Cartel includes within its numbers those which it still owns but who
    have sworn to serve. For a slave of some skill or talent that the Cartel finds
    of interest this can be a way to secure a permanent home rather than to be traded
    on as living wares. The most clever and fortunate of these might in their lifetime
    or through the generations rise up into positions of certain leadership."

- body: "## Operations\n\n### Business\n\nIf there is a profit in something, the Cartel
    probably is involved in it. When expected profit over time drops they will just
    as soon abandon it in favour of more lucrative opportunities. This flexibility
    allows them to maximize their income flow and dedicate ample resources to technological
    advancements. However, they do not exclusively chase short-term opportunities.
    \n\nFull members of the Cartel are prohibited from profiting from legal dealings,
    and the organization will often go out of its way to make things illegal so\nthey
    can be engaged in when profitable enough. This stance, which may\nseem odd to
    outsiders, is believed to be a means to ensure loyalty and abolish weakness in
    the leadership cadres. The use of associate members, proxies and unwitting dupes
    to carry out legal business is common.\n\nOne constant source of income for the
    Cartel is the pact with the Serpentis Corporation. The protection offered by the
    Guardian Angels entitles the them to a cut of all trade profits from Serpentis
    stations. This ensures a steady trickle of ISK that then gets reinvested into
    ensuring its continuation.\n\nWhen it comes to doing business, the Cartel maintains
    a high standard of professionalism. This allows its agents to blend in and foster
    connections with some of the most high profile individuals and organisations in
    the universe. At times, this even leads to certain contacts changing sides, either
    sticking at their present occupation to act like a double agent, or abandoning
    their post to work for the Cartel.\n\n### Mining\n\nBy virtue of its origins,
    the earliest form of income for the Cartel was mining. To this day ore, ice and
    gas form the foundation of industry, and are thus in continued demand. The Salvation
    Angels specialize in \"ninja mining\", the practice of extracting high-value ore
    in nimble ships that can escape at the slightest sign of a threat. With capsuleers
    now roaming all corners of space this is a necessary precaution. However, in areas
    where they are less likely to be found, or that simply are safe enough to operate
    normally in, dedicated bases are formed to maximize profitability. Naturally,
    the Angels are not above hijacking loads of ore or other valuable resources from
    legitimate miners to funnel through their industry or smuggling operations.\n\n###
    Luxury Goods\n\nDue to offer and demand, and the fat wallets of those desiring
    them, luxury goods always carry a hefty price markup. This has caused the Cartel
    to specialize in the cultivation, extraction and production of them. As planetary
    conditions are not always ideal in systems where the goods are most in demand,
    not to mention either regulations complicating things or lack thereof being a
    hazard in itself, it is common for the Cartel to simply set up space infrastructures
    at undisclosed\nlocations.\n\n### Smuggling\n\nSmuggling happens in a variety
    of ways, from quick agile and cloaking capable vessels to hiding things amongst
    other cargo or simply forging the documents that would make the transport appear
    legal. Goods range in shapes and sizes, and as per Cartel habit people and animals
    fall under cargo too. The business connections that the Angel Cartel has built
    up prove invaluable in their smuggling operations, and their best relations are
    known to call upon the network when they need it as it is one of the best out
    there.\n\n### Slavery and Prostitution\n\nThe Cartel benefits from employing slaves
    as cheap labour. The slave trade in itself also brings in a tidy sum. It is then
    no surprise that this extends into prostitution, brothels, and the production
    of x-rated holoreels.\n\nUnlike with the Amarr, slavery is a purely economic affair.
    The use of Vitoc is rather more exception than rule, unless the slaves obtained
    were already on this substance which makes the continuation of control through
    the drug often the cheapest and easiest method possible. Vitoc slaves are also
    considered less valuable as maintaining their supply of antidotes is troublesome
    and expensive. Some Amarr however are happy enough to provide Angel slavers with
    this at a markup sum or in exchange for fresh breeding stock. Slaves owned by
    the Cartel are generally well\ntaken care of, as 'damaged goods' neither sell
    nor perform as well.\n\nAs slave ownership and trade is not tied to religion,
    the general consensus within the Cartel is that one should not partake in it if
    not desired. Buying slaves to free them or seeking to root out the practice is
    frowned upon as this goes against long-term profit and internal stability, with
    the exception of a guarantee that the freed slaves were to become loyal Angels.
    While some former freed slaves within the ranks are not always happy with this,
    they do realize that charitable practices can backfire or show undesirable weakness.\n\n###
    Technology Trading\n\nTo those finding themselves in good standing, the Cartel
    is willing to bargain some of its technological developments. Many pilots view
    outlaw technology as an acceptable edge, especially when CONCORD does not disprove
    of ownership or use thereof. While the Angels are smart enough to keep the best
    things to themselves, they've certainly realized how lucrative supplying both
    capsuleers and common people with their goods can be. Black markets across the
    cluster also always seem to carry a steady supply of Cartel branded items, although
    the sources of those can be questionable as bought and salvaged goods are often
    near impossible to tell apart."

- body: "## Technology\n\n### Ships\n\nThe Guardian Angels are credited for the design
    of both the Cartel's own ships, as well as those of the Serpentis Corporation.
    While its own\nships are all unique creations, the Guardian Angels combined their
    own\ntechnology with that of the Gallente when developing a fleet setup for\nthe
    Serpentis. This was done because many Serpentis pilots already had\nextensive
    experience flying Gallente hulls in the past.The Daredevil is\nsomewhat of an
    exception here, as a modified Dramiel hull was chosen to\nserve as the base for
    ship. This was by express order of Sarpati, who\nadmired the sleek yet intimidating
    aesthetics of the Dramiel design.\n\nAll of the Cartel's own designs bear Jovian
    influences, and it is said\nthat the Machariel is even directly based on an old
    Jovian design. The\ntechnology used in each hull is however distinctly their own.
    From the\nvery beginning the focus of the Angel Cartel fleet has been on speed
    and\nsuperior firepower, to which the designs lend themselves well, in\naddition
    to looking the part.\n\n#### Angel Cartel hulls\n\n- [Dramiel](Dramiel)\n- [Cynabal](Cynabal)\n-
    [Machariel](Machariel)\n\n#### Serpentis hulls\n\n- [Daredevil](Daredevil)\n-
    [Vigilant](Vigilant)\n- [Vindicator](Vindicator)\n\nProduction of both Cartel
    and Serpentis ships falls on the Salvation\nAngels, whom also do continued research
    and development for them.\n\n### Ship Equipment\n\nFactional variants of ship
    modules and ammo go hand in hand with having\nyour own hulls, and here the Cartel
    has developed a range tailored to\ntheir needs and methods of operation. Projectile
    weapons,\nmissile launchers and their matching ammo, propulsion and armor modules\nare
    just a few examples of what exists in Angel flavour. All of them are\ndesigned
    to push the limits in terms of damage, speed, or defensive\ncapabilities.\n\n###
    Halo Implants\n\nDesigned to benefit capsuleers that work for the Angel Cartel,
    or are\nwilling to pay enough on the markets, the [Halo implant\nset](Halo-Set)
    comes in a regular and a low-grade set. Both\nmatch the regular and limited implant
    sets, but have the additional\ncapability to lower the signature radius of the
    ship the pilot commands,\nthus making it harder to be locked on.\n\n### Drugs
    and Boosters\n\nWhile the Cartel is mostly a dealer and distributor of illegal
    substances, and leaves the production and advancement to its partner the Serpentis
    Corporation, it has amongst its variety of personal technologies one component
    that is found in a plethora of hallucinogenic drugs everywhere: [Angel Cartel
    Dust](Angel-Cartel-Dust). \n\nThis fine grained powder can be used both as a main
    ingredient or to enhance or alter the working of other active ingredients. It
    is nearly never used in its raw form due to its potency, but can be mixed with
    other chemicals to develop drugs for dream enhancing and visions to full-blown
    lifelike hallucinations that can last up to a week. There have also been experiments
    where the component was used to rework the memories of users, both for good and
    for bad. However due to the unpredictable nature of hallucinations this route
    has never gained much scientific success.\n\nAngel Cartel Dust is found in both
    the common versions of [Blue Pill](Blue-Pill) and [Sooth Sayer](Sooth-sayer),
    as well as their booster equivalents with the exception of the Synth variants.
    Due to the strong link of these boosters with the Angel Cartel, CONCORD has pursued
    their replacement by other substitutes as a hardline requirement.\n\nA [booster
    experiment](The-Crystal-Dust-Compound) called Crystal Dust was started up in Tvink
    by the Thukker Tribe. The booster has Angel Cartel Dust as one of its main components
    and improves a pilot's overall performance by weaving illusions to help predict
    the outcome of various actions, almost as if clairvoyant. Despite its potency
    it never really found its way into the market, as when the dangers of booster
    use because apparent the project was considered unsalvageable and subsequently
    official funding was halted. The facility in Tvink is however still operational
    under the lead of the remaining scientists who managed to find a money source
    elsewhere.\n\n### Electronics\n\nA logical offshoot of the Cartel's developments
    in military equipment is a side-market in personal hardware and electronics. This
    isn't limited to their own creations, but also encompasses Cartel variations of
    existing tech. These devices and parts are popular with hackers and counter-security
    specialists due to their superior performance and greater capabilities, causing
    many to be flagged as illegal within Empire space. This is to the great dismay
    of technology aficionados who have to resort to the black market to get their
    hands on them.\n\n### Software\n\nLike most factions, the Angel Cartel has its
    own specific methods of encryption. To go along with this software of both protective
    and offensive nature exists, all to keep those who are not allowed to access data
    out and of course to try and break into the systems of enemies and other interesting
    parties. This however is all a closely guarded secret and the one technology that
    will likely never be made available to outsiders.\n\n### Armaments\n\nThe Angels
    are present in the weapons market too, with an assortment of big and small arms
    and matching ammunition, most of which instantly ensure personal security due
    to their aggressive nature. Here too we find both modifications of existing technologies,
    as well as some exclusive designs. Popular yet highly illegal is ammunition that
    acts on contact of skin and has the ability to incinerate, pulverize into shrapnel
    that slices deep into the body, or even uses nanotechnology to make its way into
    the bloodstream and cause all sorts of horrific harm.\n\n### Other\n\nAs the situation
    lends itself, the Cartel seeks to get involved in whatever is beneficial or lucrative
    in the short and possible long term. While many technologies never integrate themselves
    into the core portfolio of the Angels, they realize that versatile knowledge and
    experimentation are key to staying ahead. As such many become a means to an end
    and are abandoned when they have served their use. Some of these curiosities are
    found on markets within the lawless corners of space, sought after by collectors."

- body: "## Territory and Relations\n\n### Curse Region\n\nThe Angel Cartel makes
    its home in the Curse region, with the Heaven constellation as its center. The
    Utopia system was the first to see stations built in it and control spread from
    here out until it spanned the entire region. While no further territorial expansion
    has taken place since, the Cartel does regularly roam the surrounding regions
    of Feythabolis, Catch, Wicked Creek, Scalding Pass, Insmother and Detorid. \n\nAngel
    Cartel control over its space is influence by the ever-changing empires of the
    capsuleer alliances of the outer regions. The Cartel is wise enough to know that
    it is better to hold a single region and safeguard it than to overextend itself
    and risk losing control of everything.\n\n### Serpentis\n\nThe Serpentis are the
    Angel Cartel's closest allies. While their home regions are astrographically located
    on different sides of the cluster, the Serpentis have several stations out in
    Curse, whereas the Angels hold a presence in Fountain that extends beyond the
    deployment of the Guardian Angels.\n\nStarting out as hired muscle and moving
    forward as business partners, the relationship between the Angels and the Serpentis
    is one that finds its strength in the symbiosis between both groups. Where the
    former has found it more lucrative to outsource research and development to the
    latter, the reverse is met in the Serpentis being able to focus on their specialization
    and leave the practical application of their technology as well as most matters
    of protection up to the Cartel.\n\n### Sansha's Nation\n\nSansha's Nation and
    the Angel Cartel are directly opposed, both in ideology as well as due to border
    conflicts. While the Catch region is under capsuleer control, the old remnants
    of the Nation patrol it heavily, bringing them right next to the Angel's home
    in Curse. The Angels exercise a high level of vigilance around Nation patrols
    and keep close watch, striking back whenever the Sansha try and cross the line.
    These incidents have far lessened in frequency now that the Nation is holding
    incursions through most of known space. However it would be folly to assume that
    the Angels would be any less desired as potential members of the Nation's collective.\n\n###
    Sisters of EVE\n\nWhile the Angels pay little mind to the Sisters as long as they
    stay out\nof their way, the SoE regard them as some of the worst criminals in
    the cluster. Should the Cartel somehow find themselves in a situation where aid
    is needed, the Servant Sisters will do it as is their humanitarian duty. But in
    the Angels' dealings with illegal slavery and other human trafficking they form
    a direct opposite of ideals.\n\n### Amarr Empire\n\nWhile the Amarr like to keep
    their best slaves to themselves, less desirable slaves or numbers that have grown
    too many but and have little market value may find their way into Cartel hands.
    Even good slaves may come this route when the price is right.\n\nThe reverse situation
    also happens. Holders who hold little qualms as to where their slaves come from,
    and are merely interested in boosting their numbers for the sake of status, may
    obtain them from the Cartel complete with false documents as to their origin.
    After all it would be seen as disgraceful and even in some cases as a violation
    of the Scripture to have these amongst one's numbers.\n\nIt is also interesting
    to know that the Heaven constellation and its systems were named by early Amarrian
    explorers who took to the region of Curse in search for additional slaves. Since
    it is from this constellation that the Angel Cartel got its name, the Amarr are
    in some way responsible for the namesake of New Eden's biggest criminal organization.\n\n###
    Caldari State\n\nKnowing the drive of the megacorporations to succeed against
    each other, the Cartel sees a weakness in some that they are most willing to exploit.
    After all there are only so much results that good and honest competition can
    achieve. A little funding here in return for some of the profits vanishing into
    one of their shadows accounts, a little assassination of a key figure at an unfortunate
    time there, the Cartel is most happy to pull the strings by employing the methods
    they have mastered. \n\nShould their hirers seek to not honor the contract, the
    Angels will have no scruples to go public and throw them under the proverbial
    bus. With honor being so integral a part of society, the problem will be taken
    care of by its own people and the Cartel loses nothing for it. They'll even welcome
    the publicity.\n\nFurthermore, as might be expected from their opponents in the
    Gallente Federation, some Caldari State citizens carry vices that rival them.
    As there is far less tolerance for these within society those with the means will
    turn to the Cartel to see them fulfilled.\n\n### Minmatar Republic\n\nWhen it
    comes to the Thukker, The Cartel has always had a good relationship with the independent
    lesser caravans, self-governed clans as well as selective settlements out in the
    Great Wildlands. But they also deal with the Minmatar underworld at large. While
    the average law-abiding Minmatar will condemn the Cartel for their dealings with
    slavery, regardless of these being with the Amarr or others, the less scrupulous
    will disregard this and engage in deals that do not directly harm their people.\n\n###
    Gallente Federation\n\nKnown for their culture of pleasure sometimes bordering
    on outright hedonism, some Gallente have always had a great interest in recreational
    and enhancing substances. Unfortunately for them the large majority of these are
    not legal and thus must be obtained on the black market. Knowing to have good
    customers in them, the Cartel is most happy to peddle its wares to the Gallente.
    And while not all might share these views, there is a certain level of tolerance
    if one can keep their habits within limits. As such, nobody raises an eyebrow
    to the consumption of illegal drugs during parties so long as those involved do
    not cause trouble or sink to the level of being outright junkies.\n\n### Capsuleers\n\nThe
    Angel Cartel firmly believes that at present their biggest possible threat in
    New Eden is the capsuleers and the alliances they congregate in. Their immortal
    nature as well as the great wealth they seem to amass so easily could topple what
    they have worked for all these years should they become a primary target. Luckily
    for them the capsuleers seem all too caught up in power struggles amongst themselves
    to launch such a plan.\n\nThere are some within the Cartel who feel that for this
    reason it would be best to befriend some of the capsuleers and bring them on their
    side. Indeed some capsuleers seem to willingly pledge their allegiance to the
    Angel Cartel. While initially hesitant to recognize this, and concerned about
    what ulterior motives these pod dwellers may have, in recent years the Cartel
    has openly recognized some individuals as part of their own. Likewise it has also
    outright denounced some capsuleers which it feels besmirch the name of the Angels.
    Membership even for these immortals is a privilege rather than a right. And for
    the rest of them, those who call themselves enemies of the Cartel, they will employ
    all their strategies to keep them at bay and even attack capsuleer ships."

- body: "## Notable Characters\n\n### Brynn Jerdola and Setele Schellan\n\nRespectively
    the chief scout and chief of operations of the Guardian Angels, Brynn Jerdola
    and Setele Schellan are two of only a few cartel divisional leaders known to have
    engaged in combat in space. The two led the Guardian Angels\u2019 response to
    the Mordu\u2019s Legion incursion into Serpentis Prime in August of YC 106. While
    they ultimately failed to stop the Mordu force from escaping, they appear to have
    themselves escaped censure, remaining in command positions in the Guardian Angels.\n\n###
    Xavier Khun\n\nOne of the few cartel figures to have openly spoken in public and
    directly to capsuleers, Xavier Khun was considered to be the main diplomat of
    the Angel Cartel during the period of intense and open warfare between Sansha\u2019s
    Nation and the Angel Cartel in YC 108. While Khun was nominally a member of the
    Archangels, many have speculated that he was in fact a high-ranking leader and
    perhaps even a Dominations member. While it is indeed possible that Khun was a
    member of the wider staff of the Dominations, the possibility that he could be
    one of the leaders of the Angel Cartel itself is dismissed by most. Xavier Khun
    held a meeting with a number of capsuleer corporations and alliances in YC 108,
    with accredited representatives of the Salvation Angels and Dominations present.
    For a short time during the Nation-Cartel conflict he was a prominent figure,
    drumming up capsuleer support wherever possible. Once the conflict died down to
    a lower level of intensity, Khun disappeared from the diplomatic scene and has
    not been seen since.\n\n### Commander Origen\n\nAn apparent Angel Cartel renegade,
    the individual known as \u201CCommander Origen\u201D led cartel forces in a takeover
    of the Minmatar Republic\u2019s Konora system in July YC 111. While the incident
    had echoes of the Skarkon Crisis, the situation in Konora escalated rapidly, and
    there were massacres when pro-Republic protesters were killed by Angel troops.
    In a surprise development, the Angel Cartel declared Commander Origen and his
    forces renegades acting in breach of \u201Ccartel law.\u201D A Minmatar task force
    struck at the Angel renegades two days later and decisively defeated them. Fleeing
    renegade ships were reportedly engaged by Angel Cartel forces waiting in the neighboring
    N-RAEL system. The fate of Commander Origen was never satisfactorily established,
    and the entire affair, involving collusion with some Konora officials, remains
    mysterious.\n\n### Trald Vukenda\n\nAs CEO of the Dominations, Trald Vukenda is
    seen by many as the administrative head of the Angel Cartel. In reality, while
    he is certainly a powerful figure, he has no authority over the other main divisions,
    such as the Archangels or the Guardians. However, it is unthinkable that Vukenda
    is not one of the few in regular contact with the secret leadership of the cartel.
    That alone makes him a formidable power within the Angels.\n\n### Gotan Kreiss\n\nGotan
    Kreiss is the head of Dominations Internal Security and is responsible for the
    internal security of the cartel in a wider sense. While she has no mandate to
    interfere directly with the other cartel divisions, she is respected and feared
    throughout the organization. Her views on matters of Cartel internal security
    leave little room for argument.\n\n### Hakim Stormare\n\nHakim Stormare is a scoundrel
    and a rogue of Intaki ancestry that roamed New Eden for decades before entering
    the service of the Dominations as their chief of security actions. In cartel jargon,
    a \u201Csecurity action\u201D is what the Angels do to anyone who is a threat
    to their security. In this regard Stormare\u2019s reputation for cruelty is well
    appreciated and he is possibly even more feared than Gotan Kreiss, not that there
    is much reason to fear one less than the other. \n\n### Mizuro Cybon\n\nChief
    of operations for the Dominations, Mizuro Cybon has a certain air of vulnerability
    about her petite body that she notoriously plays on in her efforts to get her
    way. In reality, she is as resilient and sharp as a coil of razor wire. Anyone
    she ensnares in her schemes is sure to regret the experience, if they survive
    it.\n\n### Tobias Kruzhor\n\nTobias Kruzhor, known throughout the cartel as \u201CRaze,\u201D
    is the right-hand man of Trald Vukenda. Some consider Raze to be the real power
    behind Vukenda, as he keeps all enemies at bay and any friends of Vukenda in check.
    Again, it is unlikely that such a well-known figure is really one of the true
    leaders of the cartel. Having said that, one theory gaining some currency in recent
    years suggests the \u201Chidden masters\u201D are an elaborate ploy hiding a truth
    that is kept in plain sight of everyone.\n"
