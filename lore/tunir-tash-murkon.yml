    A market analyst and affable diplomat, he has had a considerable amount of experience
    working with [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) and the other Empires. Tunir believes
    that [Amarr Prime](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4) can capitalize on its increasing standing
    as an economic capital.\n\nEarly Life\n----------\n\nBorn YC17 Tunir was 16 years
    old when his grandmother, Mehta, was exiled\nfrom their home on Tash Murkon Prime
    in YC33 to oversee the Somi\nconstellation. This decree from Davit Tash-Murkon
    was in response to\nMehta speaking against him after her husband, the previous
    heir, had\noverlooked their own son in favour of Davit as his replacement.\nFollowing
    the fallout from her grievance her whole branch were sent to\nthe Nafomeh system.
    As a teen Tunir would resent the fact that he had\nbeen uprooted from friends,
    comfort and privilege as a result of his\ngrandmother's actions. As he grew he
    would often antagonise her and his\nfather, Shamel, who he also blamed for not
    being fit for the role of\nheir. He and his younger siblings, a brother and sister,
    would soon set\nout to be the sort of businessmen and leaders that would redeem
    their\nfamily and ensure their return to the core worlds.\n\nAfter graduating
    he worked with [Hedion University](32yJYVHiayBqLEZq4ulJrd) for many years in their\nefforts
    to develop new economic models and update imperial practices in\nlight of expanding
    interstellar trade. In particular, Tunir set about\nestablishing ties with corporate
    entities in the Somi constellation and\nquickly became popular with commercial
    representatives both inside and\noutside the Empire. He impressed with his insights
    and demeanour but\ntruly made a name for himself when he oversaw the establishment
    of a\nrelationship between [Nurtura](2TUdFyj9jYOLLT0VDlIctC) and [TransStellar
    Shipping](6H2gOgexrSym6Oy0bxTnf6). After the [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK)
    were brought into the space Tunir secured a deal that would ensure that Amarr
    foodstuffs would be shipped and sold to Federation consumers for several decades.\n\nExcited
    by the prospect of negotiating further business ties between the\nAmarr and other
    Empires and the profits it could bring Tunir started\napproaching corporations
    in all Empires. He was present for the\nnegotiations that led to both [Core Complexion
    Inc.](u4esGMynVEZ2DaTh3uuiY) entering Amarr space and [Joint Harvesting](7JqEMWSt48zSrlssI8zHz0)
    entering [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) territories. In light of his efforts
    and movements he was eventually approached by CONCORD. He was soon working with
    them and stated that it was not only a way to gain standing\noutside the influence
    of the feudalistic houses but start on the road to\nfostering a truly universal
    marketplace. He would eventually be\nappointed the Amarr representative in the
    Secure Commerce Commision. In\nthis role he was involved in drafting directives
    controlling how\nparticular blueprints were to be distributed amongst corporate
    entities.\nOne of these would become CONCORD Directive Alpha Gamma 12.\n\nHeir
    Presumptive\n----------------\n\nAs tensions rose between the Empires in YC110,
    Tunir decided to leave\nCONCORD and return to the Throne Worlds. He was brought
    to Amarr as a\nconsultant in the Oris Emperor Family station. In this facility,
    Tunir\nevaluated and reported on capsuleer trade in Amarr and provided advice\nfor
    how best to reinvest its significant profits.\n\nThis position also placed him
    close to the Imperial Court, which made\nhim a valuable confidante to [Catiz Tash-Murkon](5sw0sEytwzlBUbKWdiisUI).
    \nHe is said to be her first port of call on visiting Oris, if he has not met
    her shuttle\nhimself in Dam-Torsad, and he will regularly update her on the political\nand
    economic situation of the Throne Worlds. In the past few years Tunir\nhas even
    served as Catiz's proxy on the Privy Council, and he has become\na far more regular
    presence in the Tash-Murkon domain as well. This, and\nhis prominent visibility
    in influential Amarr society, frequently fueled\nspeculation as to his potential
    to succeed Catiz as Heir.\n\nCatiz Tash-Murkon herself has indicated Tunir as
    her preferred successor\nboth for his great experience in international trade
    and to bridge past\ndivisions in the house. As a token of this, she appointed
    Tunir to the\nposition of First Trade Lord for the Tash-Murkon Family. The fact
    that\nhe has also spent years managing capsuleer trade and contributing to SCC\nregulations
    positions Tunir uniquely to helm the corporate juggernaut\nthat drives the Tash-Murkon
    Family. He has acknowledged that capsuleers\nare becoming a significant power,
    if only economically, and that the\nheir will need an understanding of the impact
    they're having. He has\nbecome very interested in establishing the Amarr as the
    most significant\nprovider for the burgeoning capsuleer powers.\n\nRoyal Heir-elect\n----------------\n\nThe
    Tash-Murkon family council surprised some observers of the usually\nfractious
    Royal House by swiftly confirming Tunir Tash-Murkon as the\nRoyal Heir-elect on
    Catiz's recommendation ahead of the Imperial\nSuccession of YC118 trials. More
    astute watchers of Tash-Murkon house\npolitics noted that Tunir's proven ability
    to increase profits was\nalways likely to provide a strong unifying potential
    for the\ncommerce-oriented leadership of the family.\n"
