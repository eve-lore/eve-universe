- body: '**Yonate** was a CFO of [Sukuuvestaa](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB). He was heavily
    involved in the creation of prototype models and worked closely with [David](3H01yyv6huJ5QjGhvOP55j),
    the CEO of [Kaalakiota](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK), who was also his lover. The two
    used their module creation as a form of coded message to each other, each trying
    to create a more aesthetically pleasing module than the other. [Ruebin](46Sf8a6drmXcf4cWZGYlTw)
    believes the two were also trying to secretly admit they were lovers to the public
    with their increasingly flamboyant designs.


    The CEO of SuVee, [Kishbin](1ZEtRjZqk7lVOjaLdqQ4q1), disapproved of their relationship
    and worked to undermine them. He tried to buy up shares of KK and eject David
    from his position, which led David to hiding his shares in shadow accounts. This
    gave Kishbin the opportunity to frame them for corruption, leading both men to
    resign from their posts.
