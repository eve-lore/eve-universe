    the\n**Khanid** people have endured the political turmoil of their leaders\nwith
    great dignity and calm. Originally fellow settlers alongside the\nAmarr on the
    planet Athra \\- known today as [Amarr Prime](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4)\n\\- the
    Khanid were swept up by the nation\nof Amarr and the powerful message of their
    faith during the height of\nthe original [Reclaiming](70QLNGRwCwHUgmcjTmuhsA).
    For centuries they\nwere exalted members of Amarr society, until a bitter feud
    between the\nEmpire and an [Amarr heir representing the Khanid](5HlA8KgFOuLy4jTf3t54xf)\nforced
    an outright secession of the bloodline's majority, and the\nsubsequent creation
    of the independent [Khanid Kingdom](5VtgxEr1vnxuazt8lvQLoj).\nToday, a large Khanid
    population\nremains in Amarr, loyal to the faith and royalty of the Empire. Many
    of\nthem yearn for the day when the two kingdoms will reunite. They may not\nhave
    that much longer to wait.\n\n### Racial Traits\n\nLong before the Amarr Empire
    took to the sky, Khanid males were\nrecognized as the best infantrymen in the
    Empire. During the Reclaiming,\nKhanid warriors were at the forefront of the subjugation
    of the [Ealur](6TgmS6RKjOYM1Id08VBZzk), the [Ni-Kunni](5zoewV2VJJnYgvWj0Khn1K),\nand
    the [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp). Though physical stature and\nbravery count
    for less today than it did then, many Khanid males have\nfully embraced the warrior
    tradition.\n\nModern Khanid society was shaped by the ancient warrior lifestyle
    of\ntheir past. The Khanid female tends to be fiercely independent and\nresourceful,
    long accustomed to fending for herself. She backs down from\nno one, and is very
    much the mistress of her own destiny.\n\n### Ancestry\n\n#### Cyber Knights\n\nMany
    of the Khanid want to keep their warriors competitive, but the only\nway to do
    so in the modern world is through extensive body enhancements.\nThe advanced knowledge
    of cyber implants possessed by the Amarr has\nproven exceptionally useful in this
    regard. Some Khanid still aim to\nexcel in physical combat, while the more progressive
    ones seek to become\nmasters of modern warfare.\n\n#### Unionists\n\nA number
    of Khanid were unhappy with the break from the Amarr Empire.\nWhile they never
    resorted to armed resistance, they are pleased by the\nimproving relations with
    the Empire and hope the two nations will unite\nonce more. They are eager to do
    whatever is necessary to achieve this,\nincluding taking on the common enemies
    of the Empire and the Kingdom.\n\n#### Zealots\n\nThe Khanid are not generally
    known to be as devout as the Amarr, but\nthose who are tend to be fanatics even
    by Amarr standards. Religious\nKhanid are often inducted into zealous cults, generally
    based on their\ninterpretation of the [Scriptures](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp). The
    Amarr\nregard these religious Khanid with suspicious interest; on the one hand\nthe
    cultists' extremism alarms them, but on the other their religious\nfervor often
    results in deep theosophical insights.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n-   [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)\n-\t
