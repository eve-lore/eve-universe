    Junip of Aerui has long been established as in the company of those saints who
    are venerated as sources of guidance and wisdom second only to the founding prophets
    of Amarr on Athra. This is surely due to the role St. Junip appears to have played
    in the religious life of the Amarr during the Athran Reclaiming.\n\nAs such, St.
    Junip is a religious figure of great importance in the Amarr Empire, both as an
    ancient source of teaching and for their significance to later Amarr \"Reclaimings\"
    carried out in the interstellar age of the Amarr Empire.\n\nThere are many traditions
    as to the life of this figure and while occasionally the historicity of a single
    \"St. Junip of Aerui\" has been questioned, most Amarr scholars cleave to the
    orthodox view. A significant aspect of the life of St. Junip is the well-established
    tradition that the young Junip was born to noble parents, in some versions close
    relations of the Apostolic Emperor. \n\nThe story goes that Junip was found to
    have been born intersex and, while the Amarr religion has a relatively sophisticated
    outlook on sex and sexuality, the nobility's constant concern for family primacy
    complicates matters. The child is said to have been placed in a priestly school
    by the family, destined for a contemplative life in service of the Amarr church.\n\nUltimately,
    as this tradition has it, St. Junip of Aerui gave full service to the glory of
    God and the Emperor by accompanying the armies of Amarr on their campaigns of
    the Athran Reclaiming. This aspect of St. Junip's life is not held to be controversial
    and indeed is celebrated by many Amarr. One consequence is that while St. Junip
    is one of the many patron saints of holy war and soldiers, they are also considered
    a patron of intersex and nonbinary faithful thoughout the Empire.\n\n## Scriptures\n\n\"Zakara
    saw the danger to his brother, and did not hesitate; without weapon or armor,
    he hurled himself at the beast, attacking with his bare hands. Enraged, the beast
    turned and struck Zakara, opening a terrible wound in his side.<br>\n\"Seizing
    the moment, Garum ran his sword through the beast's heart, thus ending the battle
    victorious. But Zakara, mortally wounded, cried out in pain. You sacrificed yourself
    for me,' Garum said, taking his hand.<br>\n\"We are brothers,' Zakara answered,
    just before breathing his last. 'And in God we shall remain brothers for all of
    time.\"<br>\n*- The Scriptures, Saint Junip 10:25*\n\n\"Rejoice, o chosen of God<br>\nFor
    our blood fills this Valley of Death,<br>\nProclaiming our sacrifice to God,<br>\nAnd
    he shall raise it up for all time\"<br>\n*- The Scriptures, Saint Junip 15:11*\n\n\"Here
    we are.<br>\nThis is the world of God.<br>\nWe are his chosen ones.<br>\nThis
    place, this planet of peace and abundance, he made for us. It's ours for the taking.<br>\nThere
    will be obstacles and difficulties. That's his test. We must make his gift deserving.<br>\nThis
    beginning.<br>\nThis birth of life.<br>\nThis dawn of greatness.<br>\nWe can not
    fail, for we have the Emperor to lead us and destiny to follow.\"<br>\n*- The
    Scriptures, Second Letter of St. Junip of Aerui*\n\n\"Faith is an oasis from which
    we must draw in order to live. Like an oasis, faith is a gift from the Lord that
    must be shared with all.<br>\n\"Like an oasis, faith must be used with measure
    and not wasted. Like an oasis, faith should be at the center of a garden.<br>\n\"For
    it is only in the garden of a just and truthful society, watered by well measured
    faith, that we may cultivate the spirit of the people.\"<br>\n*\u2013 The Scriptures,
