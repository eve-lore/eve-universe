- body: '**Duran Ricard** was the 6th [Federal](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) Ambassador
    to the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo). Sixty years ago he met an [Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn)
    reporter and showed him around the [Crystal Boulevard](45ZcfxzqF7v2mqmLksGxYU)
    in Caille. Duran believed that, "Sooner or later, the Federation and the Empire
    have to beat the ever-loving shit out of each other and only one will rise from
    the carnage." He regarded the Amarr and Gallente views on life to be diametrically
    opposed, and expected a clash at some point.
