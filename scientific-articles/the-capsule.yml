- body: "## The Capsule\n\nA little over 120 years ago, the elusive and radically
    advanced Jovian Directorate gifted a small Caldari megacorporation with the blueprint
    and designs for a piece of technology that was to radically change the fate of
    the human race.\n\nFor a small, select, and chosen group of individuals, those
    with the physical and mental durability to survive the transition into posthumanism,
    this technology would provide the gateway to power and riches beyond their wildest
    dreams and with it, near immortality.\n\nThis piece of technology is known today
    by most as the pod or capsule. To give the device its full name, we would call
    it the hydrostatic capsule, and we would call the pilot encased within its armored
    shell a capsuleer.\n\n### Background\n\nFor thousands of years after the Dark
    Ages, when the Age of Expansion began, humanity fought a war against the ultimate
    paradox. The perils and sheer inhospitable nature of space travel versus the need
    to expand and colonize for our species to further develop itself.\n\nAlong the
    way over the last seven millennia, many historic and groundbreaking discoveries
    were made that changed the face of interstellar exploration: the rediscovery of
    warp technology, the construction of the first stargates since the devastating
    collapse of the EVE Gate, faster-than-light communication\u2014all of which paled
    in comparison to the arrival of the hydrostatic capsule in terms of consequence
    for the human race.\n\nA single device that, when melded with today\u2019s cloning
    advancements and neural and nanotechnology, can grant those select few the gift
    of lightning fast reaction, command over the most powerful starships ever constructed
    with the power of thought alone, and most importantly for many, near immortality.\n\nWith
    the dawn of the capsuleer came a new age. The Age of Expansion was left behind,
    written into the books of New Eden's history as those chosen half a million or
    so pilots took to the stars, the tens of trillions they left behind looking up
    in awe and wonder.\n\nIn YC105, with the union between capsule and clone completed,
    the Empyrean Age had dawned."

- body: "## Early History\n\nInitially the first prototype capsules constructed outside
    the Jovian Directorate contained no support for neural data transfer and clone
    reanimation for those who chose to fly them. The initial designs were also notoriously
    hostile toward the human body in more ways than can possibly be listed in a single
    reference guide, due to the myriad of genetic differences between humans and their
    genetically enhanced Jove counterparts. When their capsule was destroyed, these
    pilots would find themselves just as mortal as any other starship pilot.\n\nThe
    Ishukone Corporation, after being given the rights and blueprints to the technology
    free of charge, did however persevere and endeavored to produce several working
    capsules. Their determination was admirable, despite even the most mentally and
    physically healthy pilots more than often being mindlocked, or simply killed by
    the extremely hostile nature of the technology.\nSomething of a stigma began to
    grow around the capsule and for years, no financial or commercial institute seemed
    to hold much faith in investing the funding required to change the public perception
    that the capsule was effectively a highly sophisticated liquid-filled coffin.\n\nFor
    many decades, tales of horror detailing the things that could happen to a pilot
    inside a capsule spread across the cluster, with many regarding those who chose
    to use the technology as fools with a death wish.\n\nEven many regular pilots
    paled at the thought of hooking neural interfaces to their bodies and immersing
    themselves in what was billed as an expensive and overengineered tomb. For all
    the drama surrounding the capsule and its pilots, the Jove remained quiet, having
    made no attempt to assist with the development of the capsule to support their
    genetically inferior counterparts.\n\nWith more development from Ishukone, slowly
    over the course of the next few decades and with the outbreak of the Gallente-Caldari
    War, heroic stories of insane maneuvers and bravery began to emerge surrounding
    a handful of Caldari pilots who could withstand the intense rigors, nausea, disorientation,
    and mental stress of capsule flight.\n\nThese pilots were a rare breed; they took
    unparalleled risks due to the capsule\u2019s fundamental and obvious flaws and
    with the end of the war came a temporary end to the capsule as most of the surviving
    pilots faded into obscurity.\n\nFor several decades, the concept of the capsule
    lay dormant in the minds of Ishukone scientists as the postwar recession loomed
    and the State picked up the pieces from the most savage war in Caldari history."

- body: "## A New Beginning\n\nFor many years all across the cluster, medical advancements
    provided more and more revolutionary breakthroughs that, with the aid of cybernetic
    integration, enabled those with the ability to afford such luxuries the means
    to double, and in some instances triple, their lifespan.\n\nInitially the process
    of cloning was unreliable, with only partial cloning yielding any real success,
    primarily used to create donor organs from the intended recipient\u2019s stem
    cells to replace failing body parts.\n\nCoupled with this, the demonization of
    cloning by many social and religious groups hampered the ability of scientists
    to delve fully into detailed research for many years due to legislation and restrictions
    put in place to appease the masses.\n\nEventually in the last couple of decades,
    cloning became a realistic and stable enough process to allow those with the vast
    wealth required for such a complex process to ensure the continuation of their
    lives should the worst happen.\n\nToday many public figures, politicians, actors,
    heads of state, and other celebrities have the option to effectively insure their
    lives with an almost criminally expensive cloning contract that enables them to
    safeguard their future.\n\nSimilarly, some military personnel who serve as crew
    onboard vessels belonging to the various navies of New Eden are mandated to fly
    with a basic clone that is backed up every three months at the end of their service
    rotation. This means that if they are killed in the field, they lose a maximum
    of three months\u2019 memory and training, and can be redeployed into service
    as soon as they have been assigned to a replacement vessel."

    The Capsule & the Clone\n\nIt is not exactly known when research into the principle
    of bringing together the capsule and the clone was conceived, or when the capsule\u2019s
    technology was dusted off and assessed for potential compatibility. However, several
    years ago in early YC104, a breakthrough was made that changed the principles
    of space flight forever.\n\nAfter years of dedicated research into the workings
    of the human mind and its electrochemical operation, the first transneural burn
    scanner interface (TBSI) was successfully installed and tested onboard a newly
    constructed first generation prototype capsule.\n\nRepeated testing for a little
    under a year saw results yield successful transfer of consciousness to a waiting
    donor clone in 99.7 percent of instances, a level of success and reliability that
    surpassed anything seen before.\n\nThe TBSI quickly became a standard part of
    capsule hardware during testing, evolving into what is known today as the transneural
    echo burn scanner (TEBS), which operates to preserve the capsuleer\u2019s consciousness
    at the exact point of capsule breach.\nAfter a further six months of vigorous
    testing and tireless marketing, the public perception of the capsule had been
    refined and primed enough for cloning contractors to begin to advertise immortality,
    with the support of the technology behind the union of the capsule and clone.\n\nCONCORD
    immediately drew up legislation that required every capsule produced to be fitted
    with TEBS technology, in addition to ensuring that it was mandatory for every
    pilot capable of capsuleer flight to be issued with a full cloning contract, financed
    at their own expense or that of their employer.\n\nWithin months the capsuleer
    industry began to thrive, as this select group of gifted pilots took to the stars
    of New Eden. In mid YC105 with the passing of CONCORD's legislation via the Inner
    Circle's unanimous agreement, the capsuleer was born.\n\nWhile the component parts
    of the technology used to bring the capsule and the clone remained fundamentally
    static since its inception, the hardware used to achieve the end results has evolved
    over the course of the last twenty years to be more efficient, more reliable,
    and far more safe, with the percentage success of consciousness transfer now fluctuating
    around 99.997 percent.\n\nIn YC118, after a breakthrough spearheaded by the Sisters
    of EVE, in part using technology developed by the Society of Conscious Thought,
    the CONCORD Assembly ratified legislation that authorized the use of a new type
    of clone, known as the \u201Calpha clone.\u201D The new technology utilized with
    this fresh breed of clone allows alpha grade clones to be preimprinted with capsule
    conditioning and neural control pathways without them needing to be laid down
    when a genetically suitable candidate undergoes clone synchronization.\n\nAdditionally,
    some core skill pathways can be laid down in advance, before consciousness is
    transferred to the clone, allowing capsuleer candidates a head start in training.
    Ultimately, this has more than doubled the pool of potential candidates for capsuleer
    training, and has almost eliminated the risk of a capsuleer becoming mindlocked."

- body: "## Engineering\n\nThe principle behind the capsule is simple: to ensure the
    survival of the pilot of a vessel in 100 percent of cases involving the craft\u2019s
    destruction, regardless of the situation. The system encompasses the most advanced
    technologies from a wide range of fields to achieve this goal with an error margin
    today of less than 0.003 percent.\n\nThere are several key components that make
    up the capsule and its subsystems. They all go together, and if functioning correctly
    they collectively ensure that a pilot encased within a capsule is effectively
    immortal.\n\nThe capsule is designed to act as the brain of any starship, while
    still being lightweight and maneuverable enough to be used as an escape vessel
    should the ship be destroyed or disabled.\n\n![Capsule Diagram](//images.contentful.com/1gqwxa4vbed9/7ug0tKD8Qa8Vtwyr8Bd5t1/e6e95d6d56836d9fa364eda3c617bc3d/capsule_diagram1.png)\n\n###
    Capsule Construction\n\nFrom the outside moving in, the capsule is a complex and
    highly strung web of technologies that bond together to protect and seal off the
    pilot from the elements while still giving full awareness and neural control over
    his or her vessel.\n\nThe external hull of the capsule seen to the observer is
    constructed from a 100 millimeter para-aramid carbon fiber impregnated variation
    of the titanium diborite armor plating used in most Caldari derived starship hulls.
    While formidable on its own, the addition of a strong fiber weave to the structure
    of the armor gives it a ballistic stopping power almost ten times greater than
    that of standard diborite armor of the same thickness.\n\nThis enables the thickness
    of the armor used on the external hull to be vastly reduced to save on mass, increasing
    the capsule\u2019s inertia rating and maneuverability to aid in its use as a means
    of escape for the pilot.\n\nBeneath the outer armor, behind a 200 millimeter expansion
    gap which is exposed to vacuum, lies the internal pressure sealed hull of the
    capsule itself. Known more commonly as the \u201Cstage two\u201D hull, it is comprised
    of two interleaved 100 millimeter thick layers of tungsten carbide armor to provide
    structural rigidity.\n\nThe external hull is rigidly connected to the stage two
    via a collapsible shock damping assembly at the center of each armor plate, which
    acts as a buffer to soften the stress of external impacts. The stage two hull
    is pressure sealed, providing the barrier between the environment outside and
    the controlled internal environment of the capsule.\nInside the stage two hull,
    a second air gap of 300 millimeters lies between the inner surface of the hull
    and the outer side of the silicate reinforced polycarbonate glass suspension chamber,
    inside which rests the capsuleer.\n\nThis 300 millimeter air gap protects the
    suspension chamber, technically known as the ovum, which is attached to the stage
    two hull at the crown (top) and foot (bottom) of the capsule in a pair of dampened
    retaining assemblies. To prevent lateral movement of the ovum, the same system
    as between the stage two and external hull is used in a ring around the chamber
    at the capsule\u2019s widest point.\nThe air gap between the chamber and stage
    two hull is pressurized to atmospheric standard pressure (1.0 bar / 100 kPA).
    This air gap is monitored constantly during the capsule\u2019s operation and provides
    the trigger for the initiation of the TEBS (transneural echo burn scanner) system
    if the hull is breached or other factors cause an internal pressure deviation
    of more than +/- 0.01 bar.\n\nProtection of the ovum is paramount, as within this
    lies the most valuable cargo that a starship has ever carried: the capsuleer,
    immersed in an oxygen rich, nanosaturated breathable fluorocarbon derived suspension
    solution.\n\nThe ovum itself is of no spectacular construction to behold. A convex,
    egg like silicate glass bubble with a single 950 millimeter wide circular port
    at its base for access and egress, and two smaller 150 millimeter ports at either
    side of its crown within the retaining assembly for the circulation of suspension
    fluid when the capsule is in service with a vessel.\n\nWithin the chamber, the
    capsuleer is immersed in the amber colored low viscosity, breathable suspension
    solution, also pressurized at atmospheric standard. The capsuleer\u2019s lungs
    are flooded with this fluid on immersion, allowing the pilot to breathe liquid
    for the duration of their flight, with the solution\u2019s bionanite rich composition
    acting as a carbon dioxide scrubber.\nThe liquid suspension helps in further cushioning
    them from the rigors of faster than light travel and external impact, stabilizing
    lung and body pressure in space, as well as being rich in nutrients and antibacterial
    nanite compounds that assist in maintaining hygiene and a sterile environment
    for the pilot.\n\n### Onboard Engineering Systems\n\nThe capsule has extremely
    low power requirements given its small size and limited onboard functionality.
    It possesses no local offensive weapons systems, or defensive repair systems.\nWhen
    operating under its own power the current iteration of the vessel (the MK3 capsule)
    is powered by a scaled down Ishukone derived graviton reactor based on the Lai
    Dai designed unit seen widely in use today in the Harpy class assault frigate.
    Earlier versions of the capsule used a similar unit scaled down from the Griffin
    class frigate.\n\nThis tiny unit gives a total offering of 1.15 mW of potential
    power output to support the capsule\u2019s subsystems and is linked to twin second
    generation scalar semiorganic capacitor banks to power the propulsion system,
    which provide an operational energy storage capacity of 125 GJ.\nThe twin capacitor
    banks provide power to the vessel\u2019s FTL warp drive assembly, as well as the
    subwarp magpulse propulsion system derived from a single assembly normally seen
    powering most commercial Caldari designed shuttles. The capsule\u2019s propulsion
    system assembly retains the standard directional thruster designs, but is rated
    smaller due to its size, producing 0.25 MN at maximum power.\n\nPower for NILS,
    the NIA, and TEBS systems are provided directly from the vessel\u2019s reactor,
    running through a full bridge rectifier and smoothing capacitors where appropriate
    depending on each system\u2019s requirement, to prevent voltage or current fluctuations
    from propulsion and warp core demands.\n\nThe entire vessel is operated and controlled
    via the capsuleer through the NIA, with an Ishukone designed third generation
    quantum microprocessor matrix providing the processing power for internal flight
    control. The matrix also provides the processing power for the EIS, which controls
    interaction with the vessel currently in service.\n\n### Transneural Echo Burn
    Scanner\n\nThe Transneural Echo Burn Scanner (TEBS) system lies dormant during
    normal flight, monitoring information from the NILS system as well as from the
    propulsion, guidance, and pressure monitoring systems of the capsule. It consists
    of the neural echo scanner itself, as well as an ultrahigh gain FTL burst broadcast
    array for the transmission of captured neural data.\n\nStored in a separately
    armored pressure hull at the crown of the capsule, the device constantly monitors
    life support readouts from the capsuleer at a polling rate of one picosecond,
    as well as data from the propulsion and guidance systems, reactor, and most importantly
    the pressure readout from the air gap beneath the stage two hull.\n\nDestruction
    of the capsule, or more specifically a sufficient drop in pressure beneath the
    stage two hull, triggers the TEBS into action, which is near instantaneous and
    occurs within five picoseconds.\n\nFirstly, in two nanoseconds the hardware completes
    a highly destructive deep neural scan of the capsuleer\u2019s skull, recording
    the status of every neuron within their brain, along with all vital medical statistics
    including blood pressure, heart rate, and blood oxygen level. The pilot is then
    euthanized with a direct 10 milliliter injection of a methylmercury-based neurotoxin
    to the adrenal cortex.\n\nSecondly, the entire data package, which can be several
    petabytes in size, is burst transmitted to the capsuleer\u2019s cloning facility
    as stipulated in their cloning contract.\n\nThe entire process takes five nanoseconds,
    with the powerful neurotoxin ensuring instant death on injection. If all goes
    well, the subject awakens a short while later inside a CRU (clone reanimation
    unit) at his chosen medical facility, with memory retention up until the point
    of death.\n\n### Neural Interface Life Support\n\nThe Neural Interface Life Support
    (NILS) system is responsible for the monitoring and well-being of its host, and
    the sustainment of his or her environment within the capsule.\nThe NILS is in
    contact and maintains a constant exchange of data with the TEBS system, drawing
    its statistics from the NIA, which attaches it directly to the capsuleer\u2019s
    central nervous system.\n\nThis hardware is used only as a method of monitoring
    and recording data, and passing it between the TEBS and NIA hardware.\n\nIn certain
    instances, when the capsuleer\u2019s vital signs may fail, or the internal environment
    of the capsule becomes unsafe for the capsuleer or incapable of sustaining life,
    the NILS system is the only piece of hardware able to administer an override call
    to the TEBS system to initiate the deep scanning process.\n\n### Neural Interface
    Array\n\nThe link between human and machine, the Neural Interface Array (NIA)
    is the most sophisticated piece of hardware installed in a capsule. Capable of
    taking biological readouts and statistics and converting them to digital data
    for processing by other capsule subsystems, the NIA is the linchpin of the entire
    operation, and links the host to the rest of the capsule\u2019s hardware.\n\nThe
    NIA is fundamental for the operation of the capsule, utilizing ultrahigh bandwidth
    neural jacks grafted directly to the capsuleer\u2019s spinal cord. These intercept
    bioelectrical signals from the brain, relaying them to the capsule\u2019s processing
    matrix and the EIS for processing and conversion into usable data, before transmission
    to the vessel that the capsule is currently in service with.\n\nPhysically, the
    NIA is a free-floating device connected to the internal wall of the capsule\u2019s
    suspension chamber by a flexible and extendible ultrahigh bandwidth umbilicus
    that allows limited flotation movement of the capsuleer within the chamber during
    flight.\n\nThe neural jacks lock into the interface on the host\u2019s spine,
    with a vacuum-sealed support matrix that extends out as far as the capsuleer\u2019s
    shoulder blades to support full body weight during immersion and decanting procedures.\n\n###
    External Interfacing System\n\nThe capsule\u2019s onboard processing system used
    for its own control also includes a dedicated External Interfacing System (EIS)
    for communication of commands to the vessel currently in service.\n\nConnected
    to all but one of the capsule and ship\u2019s systems, the EIS is the single gateway
    in ship to capsule communication, streaming hundreds of petabytes of live data
    and commands between the ship and the capsuleer via the control umbilicus.\n\nThe
    only capsule system that the EIS is refused hardwired access to by design is the
    TEBS system, for the capsuleer\u2019s protection from external interference during
    immersion.\n\nHoused beneath a protective crown cone at the nose of the capsule,
    the control umbilicus interface is well protected until the capsule is secured
    within the vessel in service. Once in place, typically in an inverted orientation
    so that the nose becomes the bottom of the capsule, the nose cone splits and retracts
    to reveal the ship to capsule interface, or SCI.\n\nOnce the capsule has been
    installed in the ship and is safely secured, the control umbilicus extends from
    the vessel to meet the SCI and locks in place. Along with this, two pressure sealed
    hoses are also attached to the EIS interface to allow the vessel to circulate,
    purify, and carbon scrub the capsuleer\u2019s suspension fluid, enabling the pilot
    to stay immersed for long periods of time.\n\nThe control umbilicus itself is
    classed as part of the vessel in service rather than the capsule and for practical
    purposes, offers near limitless bandwidth for communication between the capsuleer
    and the subsystems of the attached craft.\n\nOnce the capsule and starship are
    successfully interfaced via the EIS, the capsuleer effectively becomes part of
    the starship. This gestalt existence allows the pilot to maintain complete and
    instantaneous control over every aspect of the ship\u2019s operation with the
    power of thought alone, replacing the traditional command crew seen on noncapsule
    derived vessels.\n\n### The Capsule Chamber\n\nKnown more commonly as \u201Cthe
    Tank,\u201D an affectionate nickname given by most non-capsuleer crew members,
    the capsule chamber is the most secure bay within any capsuleer\u2019s vessel.
    It is within this armored inner sanctum that the capsule rests during flight.
    Constructed deep within the bowels of every vessel, this heavily armored blast
    shielded chamber is accessible by only one method.\n\nAccess to the chamber is
    permitted only via the hatch and causeway through which the Capsule travels to
    it. The causeway is sealed via a minimum of two heavily armored blast doors, one
    at the entrance to the chamber itself and the other beneath the surface of the
    vessel\u2019s hull, behind the hatch, which gives access to the causeway from
    outside the vessel.\n\nUsually, to maintain the smooth profile and armor integrity
    of a vessel, the outer hatch that leads to the tank is simply one of the armored
    plates of the vessel\u2019s outer skin that when removed, reveals the causeway
    through which a capsule gantry can gain access. This plate is typically fitted
    with explosive bolts that blast it free when emergency egress is required.\n\nDepending
    on the design and personal specifications of the capsuleer owner of the vessel,
    further hatches and security devices may be fitted to enhance the vessel\u2019s
    operational safety.\n\nTo maintain structural integrity of the chamber in flight
    and provide maximum protection for the capsule and its pilot, the chamber itself
    has no other points of access, save for the various electronic interfaces that
    breach its walls for connection to the capsule.\n\nDuring flight, the inside of
    the tank is not pressurized and remains exposed to vacuum to further enhance security
    and provide a more controlled environment for the capsule\u2019s subsystems to
    operate. This is achieved by locking down the access causeway, but not pressure
    sealing the armored blast doors, which protect the area from intrusion.\n\nIn
    the rare event that emergency access to the capsule chamber is required during
    space flight, the capsuleer can at his or her discretion authorize the release
    of the hatches and the firing of the outer explosive bolts so that maintenance
    personnel with the correct protective equipment for working in vacuum can gain
    access to the chamber.\n\nWhen stationside, the causeway takes on the atmospheric
    characteristics of the hangar, and once the capsule is removed to undergo the
    decanting process, access to the chamber is typically free flowing for specifically
    authorized personnel.\n\nPlease note that the cutaway technical specifications
    shown within this reference guide deliberately do not display the structure and
    layout of the causeway or the capsule chamber both for clarity of the systems
    around it and for security reasons, as many of the specifications used in construction
    of this part of a vessel remain classified and vary depending on an individual
    capsuleer\u2019s security specifications.\n\nThe construction principles of the
    causeway and capsule chamber are carried throughout all capsuleer capable vessels,
    although depending on the cultural origin and design of the starship in question,
    construction materials and specific security measures may vary.\n\n### Hydrostatic
    Fluid\n\nUsually known to capsuleers by its affectionate name of \u201Cpod goo,\u201D
    the hydrostatic fluid used in the capsule is a complex and perfectly balanced
    self-sustaining ecosystem that supports, nourishes, and maintains the capsuleer\u2019s
    physical health while he or she is immersed.\n\nTo give it its full name, we would
    technically call the liquid an oxygen rich, nano-saturated, breathable glucose
    based suspension solution.\n\nThe entire solution is formed around a base of common
    carbohydrate glucose with various nutrients, vitamins and minerals amalgamated
    into the base compound along with several variations of bionanites that assist
    with life support.\n\nFor purposes of liquid respiration, the solution remains
    oxygen rich, with an infusion of nanotechnology designed to absorb carbon dioxide
    from the capsuleer\u2019s lungs, and break it into component parts before releasing
    paired oxygen molecules back into the fluid.\n\nDuring normal flight, the hydrostatic
    fluid is circulated within the capsule and drawn out through the attached vessel\u2019s
    life support system where the fluid is carbon scrubbed to prevent lethal buildup.
    Coupled with respiration, the fluid provides the base nutrients and vitamins required
    to sustain the capsuleer for extended periods of time in flight."

    The Capsule\u2019s States of Operation\n\nDuring its life cycle, a capsule will
    have four states of operation within normal design parameters. These states do
    of course depend on the capsuleer\u2019s current environment and the situation
    in which the capsule is used.\n\n### In Service\n\nIn service the capsule is retained
    within the capsule chamber, secured by four air over oil dampened hydraulic retaining
    clamps which act to absorb the stresses and movement of the vessel around it,
    keeping movement of the capsule to a minimum in relation to the vessel\u2019s
    superstructure and artificial gravity well.\n\nTypically, the capsule is inaccessible
    to physical external influence during this state, and operates with the capsuleer
    sealed inside and isolated from the elements. In this state the capsule\u2019s
    own reactor, power core, and propulsion system are shut down for self-diagnosis
    and automated maintenance while it draws power from the vessel via the control
    umbilicus.\n\nWhen in this state, the Capsule\u2019s hydrostatic fluid is circulated
    and carbon scrubbed by the vessel\u2019s life support subsystem, and a perfect
    ecological balance within the suspension solution is maintained via intricate
    monitoring of the fluid\u2019s composition, with the fully automated system maintaining
    balance.\n\nIn theory, and disregarding the mental implications of spending extended
    lengths of time immersed, in this state the capsule is capable of sustaining life
    support for the capsuleer indefinitely.\n\n### In Free Flight\n\nUnder normal
    circumstances if the capsuleer chooses to eject from his or her vessel the control
    umbilicus is shut down and safely uncoupled after the capsule\u2019s own reactor
    and power core are brought into service.\n\nAt the same time the hydrostatic fluid
    circulation hoses are pressure sealed and retracted. The electromagnetic seals
    of the retaining clamps are then released along with the hatches to the access
    causeway.\n\nThe capsule is then automatically guided free of the vessel under
    its own power before control is relinquished to the pilot.\n\nOperating under
    its own power, the capsule will provide approximately 180 days of life support
    for the pilot, before the solution and the nanites within become saturated with
    carbon and are unable to further process carbon dioxide. At this point, the neural
    interface life support will trigger the TEBS, euthanizing the pilot and returning
    them to their chosen cloning facility.\n\nWhen operating in this mode, separated
    from a vessel, the capsule utilizes its own onboard reactor, power core, sub-light
    propulsion systems, and warp core.\n\n### In Maintenance\n\nFrom time to time
    a capsuleer will feel the need to dock, stretch their legs, and go about their
    business. When this is the case, the capsule is retained within the capsule gantry,
    commonly referred to as the pod gantry, attached to the pilot\u2019s secure accommodation.\n\nHere,
    the capsule can be unsealed, split, and the capsuleer can be safely decanted and
    go about their business.\n\nDuring maintenance, the capsule is typically in a
    state of hibernation while the hydrostatic fluid is flushed and destroyed. When
    the capsuleer is ready to resume flight, fresh fluid is used to refill and pressurize
    the hydrostatic suspension chamber.\nDuring downtime, the capsule remains connected
    to the gantry and is in a constant state of self-testing and readiness, with all
    systems being periodically checked for correct function and operation.\n\n###
    In Emergency Service\n\nIn an emergency situation, time is of the utmost importance.
    Therefore, the separation procedure between capsule and vessel is much more direct
    and destructive once the capsule detects that it may be in harm\u2019s way.\n\nTypically,
    a single trigger will push the capsule into emergency service mode, changing its
    operational protocol from that of a vessel control system to an emergency lifeboat.
    The process for separation can take as little as a single second, perhaps two
    at the most.\n\nFirstly, the EIS receives a distress call from the vessel. Typically,
    this is a \u201Cship is out of control\u201D relay broadcast from the attached
    vessel\u2019s gyroscopic and navigational monitoring systems, but may sometimes
    also take the form of a notification of critical atmosphere containment failure
    due to vessel hull breach or reactor containment field failure.\n\nWhen this call
    is received, the capsule\u2019s own reactor, power core, and propulsion systems
    are immediately brought online from the state of maintenance hibernation. Simultaneously,
    the hydraulic retaining clamps are depressurized via explosive destruction of
    their control valves, which forcibly retracts them back into the walls of the
    capsule chamber to prevent external damage to the capsule, while the control umbilicus
    link is disabled and thrown loose.\n\nThe third stage is the shutoff of hydrostatic
    fluid circulation. The ports are immediately sealed on the ship to capsule interface,
    the hoses fired loose, and the inner causeway seal is released to allow capsule
    egress.\n\nThe final stage is the forced ejection of the capsule. Effectively,
    it is fired from the causeway as a projectile would be fired from a gun using
    an overcharged burn of its sublight propulsion system. Once it is thrown free
    of the vessel, its onboard guidance and propulsion systems bring it to stable
    rest."

- body: "## Capsule Variations\n\nOver the last decade or so since the initial union
    of capsule and clone, the basic operating principle of the hardware has remained
    the same. Small revisions have however been made to the capsule and its subsystems
    over the years, allowing further licensed improvement on the initial designs drafted
    up by the Ishukone Corporation from the technical data they received.\n\n### MK1
    Capsule\n\n*In Service Early YC104 to Late YC109*\n\nThe MK1 was the initial drafted
    design of the capsule, recognized mostly for the diamond patterned dark brownish
    tinted appearance of its 75 millimeter para-aramid carbon fiber impregnated external
    armor plating.\n\nInitially this variation of the unit came with a scaled down
    version of the Griffin\u2019s graviton reactor and power core, along with a single
    first generation scalar semiorganic capacitor bank that produced the 125 GJ of
    operational charging capacity required for operation.\nThis unit\u2019s main difference
    from those in operation today was only apparent once it was split to allow the
    decanting process, with the outer hulls of the unit splitting at the capsule\u2019s
    widest point, allowing the top half to be hoisted away by the capsule gantry.\n\n###
    MK2 Capsule\n\n*In Service Late YC109 to Mid YC111*\n\nThe MK2 retained many of
    the features of the initial design, but with an upgrade to twin scalar semiorganic
    capacitor banks wired to the vessel\u2019s graviton reactor in parallel, to provide
    equal charging and more stable voltage and power distribution with less stress
    on the bank.\nThe external armor plating was also improved upon, with a revised
    heavier carbon weave, and larger plates with an increase in penetration protection
    of 100 millimeters. This variation of the capsule did however maintain the center
    split opening method of the original units designed by Ishukone.\n\nThis variation
    of the capsule saw the shortest service life of any unit to date, with an upcoming
    revision of the propulsion system and sub-structure already in the pipeline when
    the revised blueprints were published.\n\n### MK3 Capsule\n\n*In Service Mid YC111
    to YC119*\n\nThe MK3 saw the largest revision of the capsule\u2019s substructure
    so far, and the complete redesign of the reactor system.\n\nThe external and stage
    two hulls were, for want of a better phrase, completely redesigned, to enable
    a much more hygienic and convenient method of immersion and decanting. Coupled
    with this the refitting of stationside capsule gantries made the entire process
    much faster, more dignified, and more pleasant for those engaging in capsuleer
    flight.\n\nIn terms of hardware, a redesign of the reactor system increased power
    output to 1.15 mW, replacing the now aging reactor unit based on designs from
    the Griffin class frigate with a scaled down and vastly more efficient assembly
    from the Harpy class assault frigate seen in operation today.\n\n## Capsule Construction
    & Licensing\n\nCapsule construction occurs in just about every corner of the cluster,
    with many corporations cutting a substantial profit from the fabrication of these
    intricate and complex pieces of hardware.\n\nWhile illegal and unlicensed hardware
    manufacturing does happen in all corners of New Eden, generally corporations who
    manufacture and fabricate capsules are SCC (Secure Commerce Commission) licensed
    and build to a strictly controlled and periodically revised blueprint.\nCapsule
    manufacturers supply the cluster\u2019s major insurance corporations, with every
    cloning contract a capsuleer signs including the automatic replacement of their
    destroyed unit with a fully licensed replacement.\n\nMany manufacturers also supply
    licensed independent retailers who are able to offer the units as upgrades or
    replacements to independent capsuleers.\n\nOn the more sinister side of the cluster\u2019s
    borders, illegally manufactured units with custom modifications are widely available
    for reasonable prices. Often these capsules will contain the hardware appropriate
    for the in-flight intravenous ingestion of combat performance boosters and other
    such dangerous practices.\n\nGenerally, the industry is very well controlled,
    with a periodic revision of the capsule\u2019s core systems to ensure the technology
    remains cutting edge."
