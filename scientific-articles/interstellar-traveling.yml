    Interstellar Travelling\n\n__By Alain E. Topher__\n\nWell, here is a detailed
    description for all you techno-buffs on jumps - the amazing technology on how
    and why it is possible to traverse the vastness of space in a matter of minutes.
    Tacked along are various interesting tidbits on the history of the races and their
    elusive search for their ancestry. Written by one of the best recognized intellectual
    in the world of EVE, this is an insightful glimpse into the minds and beliefs
    of those that live there.\n\n##  1 - Where do we come from?\n\nFor centuries men
    speculated from where mankind came. Today, it has been established beyond reasonable
    doubt that all the different races and factions found in our part of the galaxy
    must have originated from a common source.\n\nYet it has proven difficult to piece
    all the different artifacts together into a coherent picture. In any case, it
    seems logical from a biological standpoint that humans evolved on the same planet.
    Even if various differences can be found between and within factions, the likeness
    in the DNA structure clearly points to a common origin. But then the question
    is: where is this fabled planet that humans evolved on and how did the human race
    end up in numerous separate places?\n\n>![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/62930/1/jump_ancient.jpg#left)\n>
    \n> *A number of ancient jump gates, or fractions of jump gates, are known to
    exist in numerous solar systems.*\n\nLets look at what we know: It is now undoubted
    that a race capable of inter-stellar travel roamed our space many thousands of
    years ago. A number of ancient jump gates, or fractions of jump gates, are known
    to exist in numerous solar systems. Whether these jump gates were built by our
    own ancestors or a totally alien race is unknown. These jump gates have some peculiar
    traits. First of all, age tests have shown that all these jump gates were built
    within the space of 50 to 100 years. And yet the design of many of the jump gates
    is a little bit varied between places, like they were constructed by different
    people. These facts raise many questions: why were they all constructed within
    this short time-span, and none since? Were they built by the same race, or maybe
    two or more conflicting races?\n\nThe answer most favored is that of war. Only
    a conflict could explain this quick construction of dozens of jump gates and why
    everything seemed to come to an abrupt halt one day. But who were fighting? And
    where are the combatants now? It seems highly unlikely that factions capable of
    inter-stellar warfare suddenly disappear into thin air.\n\nBy studying the layout
    of the jump gate remnants, a curious pattern emerges. The jump gates snake out
    like a spider-web from a central point. And what is the central point? It is the
    system known to Amarrians, who first found it, as \u2018Imlau Eman\u2019, or the
    \u2018Mouth of God\u2019, but is today better known as EVE.\n\nThe EVE system
    is an enigma that is still very much a mystery to us. The system itself is not
    that impressive \u2013 just some space debris and a few asteroid belts orbiting
    a pale white dwarf. But at the outskirts of the system is a phenomenon that has
    puzzled us for centuries. At the center of this phenomenon lies a huge structure,
    obviously built by some advanced civilization eons ago. The structure looks very
    much like a jump gate, except it is many times bigger than any space structure
    of ours. The gate is fairly plain all around, but there are markings here and
    there, in some ancient language that has not been fully decrypted. At the top,
    the largest of these markings is a three-letter word that says EVE. There isn\u2019t
    full agreement among scholars about the meaning of this word, but most people
    regard it to be simply the name of the gate.\n\nNow, every indication points to
    this being the gate that our forefathers used to enter this world, but despite
    massive studies on the gate and the EVE system in whole, we still haven\u2019t
    uncovered what happened to the gate all these millenniums ago.\n\nExtremely bright
    and powerful electromagnetic turbulence emits from the EVE gate, as it is commonly
    called. This turbulence seems to originate from within the gate, so it is believed
    that the gate is actually open and the electromagnetic storms are coming through
    from wherever the gate is linked to.\n\nIn any case, the turbulence makes it extremely
    difficult to study the gate. Fortunately, the storms pulsate rhythmically, meaning
    that every other year or so they recede enough to allow closer scrutinizing. But
    even then the turbulence is enough to rip to pieces any vessel foolish enough
    to wander close to it.\n\nThe immense brightness emitting from the gate can easily
    be seen in solar systems close to the EVE system as a vibrating bright star on
    the night sky. But even in systems in the farthest regions of the known world
    it can still be seen with the aid of a telescope. The Amarrians, whose home system
    is only a few light-years from the EVE system, were in the best position to marvel
    at the gate. Many thousands of years ago, while still on a primitive level, the
    Amarrians actually coupled the peculiar phenomenon they saw in the sky with their
    age-old religion and even today the EVE gate holds great importance in the Amarrian
    state religion.\n\nThe search for our ancestors goes on. Even if the facts lead
    us to the EVE system, it seems to be the end of the road. The extensive studies
    done there over the decades seem no closer to providing the answer to this important
    question.\n\n##  2 - The earliest jump gates and the first inter-stellar travelers.\n\nOnce
    the Amarr Empire had reached the technology level were it could enter space, it
    started to vigorously chart their home system. Due to technological limitations
    this survey took a long time. Finally, the Amarrians stumbled upon the remains
    of a jump gate at the outskirts of their solar system.\n\nBy studying the remains,
    which were more or less intact, the Amarrians were able to garner enough information
    to build a jump gate of their own. The jump gate was operational but obviously
    it lacked connections to other jump gates, as it was the only one of its kind.
    Thus the Amarrians were forced to physically send ships capable of building jump
    gates between solar systems before a stable wormhole could be formed into the
    system to connect the two gates. These gate construction ships often took decades
    to arrive, the crew suspended in cryo-tanks for the duration of the voyage. Only
    in recent years with the coming of jump drives capable of jumping between systems
    with no jump gates in them is it possible to overcome this time-consuming prelude
    to inter-stellar traveling via jump gates and still today dozens of gate construction
    ships are enroute to a distant system.\n\nBut patience is a virtue the Amarrians
    have mastered well and they steadily expanded in every direction from their Amarr
    home system. Now, more than two millenniums since the construction of their first
    jump gate, the Amarrians occupy hundreds of solar systems.\n\n>![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/62930/1/jump_sametime.jpg#left)\n>
    \n> *The Gallenteans and the Caldari discovered jump gate technology at relatively
    the same time.*\n\nThe Gallenteans and the Caldari discovered jump gate technology
    at relatively the same time, due to the simple fact that their home worlds were
    then in the same system. This was a little over 700 years ago. The Gallenteans
    and the Caldari did not enjoy the luxury of finding a relatively intact jump gate
    relic in their system as the Amarrians did. Instead there were only fragmentary
    pieces to be found, so they had nothing to build on. Still, these fragments pointed
    the researchers into the right direction and many jump gate theories were tried
    out. It wasn\u2019t until after the discovery of a companion brown dwarf, making
    the system a binary system, that the gate research got on the right track. It
    wasn\u2019t long after that before the first working jump gate was erected. The
    Amarr type of jump gate and the Gallente/Caldari one both work on the same principle
    (see next chapter), but there are some minuscule differences in how the different
    parts of the gate work exactly.\n\n>![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/62930/1/jump_neverdis.jpg#left)\n>
    \n> *At that time both the Gallente and the Caldari worlds were bursting at the
    seams and major effort was made in sending ships to nearby systems to build jump
    gates.*\n\nAt that time both the Gallente and the Caldari worlds were bursting
    at the seams and major effort was made in sending ships to nearby systems to build
    jump gates. The mass exodus of the Gallenteans and the Caldari to other systems
    was nothing like the calm, deliberate expansion of the Amarr Empire, where only
    one system was colonized at a time and every aspect of the expansion was rigidly
    controlled by the state. Instead, private firms, the first of the Caldari Corporations
    among them, were chiefly responsible for surveying systems, sending the constructions
    ships, and selling the territory to the colonists. In the space of 500 years or
    so the combined expansion of the Gallenteans and the Caldari had almost equaled
    the total expansion of the Amarrians in 2000 years.\n\nThe Jovians are not very
    forthcoming with information about their technological advances in this regard.
    Today they employ jump gates functioning on the same principle as the other\u2019s,
    but nothing is known on where or when the Jovians acquired their jump gate technology.
    However, they\u2019ve revealed an interesting fact: according to ancient Jovian
    legends, the Jovians used the ancient jump gates that scatter the world to travel
    between solar systems a long time ago, before the jump gates crumbled. The legends
    stay silent about the makers of the gates.\n\n##  3 - The principles of jump gate
    technology.\n\nJump gates are built around artificial wormholes, created by exploiting
    gravitational resonances found in binary systems. This resonance is as a friction
    between gravitational waves of stellar objects, the more massive the objects,
    the stronger the resonance between them. Positions of planets in a solar system,
    as well as the complex structure of dust rings around heavy planets illustrate
    this resonance.\n\n>![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/62930/1/jump_staple.gif#left)\n>
    \n> *These stable wave patterns come in a succession of standing wave patterns,
    similar to those created on a guitar string.*\n\nIn binary systems there exists
    strong resonance phenomenons, where the gravitational field of two stars in a
    stable binary formation would interfere with each other, like ripples from two
    wave sources. These stable wave patterns come in a succession of standing wave
    patterns, similar to those created on a guitar string. The strongest resonance
    is the 1:1 resonance (the first harmonic, so to speak), with two stationary node
    points situated in the center of each of the two stars. The second strongest resonance
    is the 1:2 resonance (the second harmonic), where an additional stationary node
    point appears in the field exactly mid-way between the stars (if of equal mass),
    and so on for successive resonances.\n\nAt the node points, the rapid oscillation
    of the gravitational field in opposite directions creates strong shear in the
    contravariant energy-momentum tensor. Under normal circumstances this stress is
    dissipated by high-frequency graviton radiation, and does thus not create any
    noticeable macroscopic phenomenons.\n\nBut if this stress is confined and forced
    to build-up in a limited region of space, then the tensor-field will eventually
    develop a steadily growing high-curvature tentacle like structure in the space-time
    continuum. More specifically, the tentacle constitutes a self-avoiding 4-manifold
    that attempts to grow farther and farther from itself. The tip of the tentacle,
    where the curvature is highest, effectively acts like a magnet on space-time,
    and for high enough curvature it can eventually induce the creation of a small
    tentacle in remote high-density regions, that can reach to the tip and spontaneously
    combine. An analogy of this phenomenon is when lightning strikes ground, where
    the tip of the downward lightning actually creates a small upward lightning emanating
    from the ground and the two combine somewhere above the ground, thus closing the
    electrical circuit.\n\n>![](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/62930/1/jump_teng.gif#left)\n>
    \n> *The tip of the tentacle, and for high enough curvature it can eventually
    induce the creation of a small tentacle in remote high-density regions, that can
    reach to the tip and spontaneously combine.*\n\nThe main device of jump gates
    is a so-called mass boson sphere, based on one of the fundamental physic fields
    that mediates mass, and thus interacts strongly with gravitational waves. The
    sphere is filled with mass boson plasma, which reflects gravitational waves, pretty
    much in the same way as a mirror reflects light. By adjusting the plasma density
    so that it reflects the high-frequency gravitational waves involved in the dissipation
    of tensor shear, this radiation is trapped within the sphere, thus leading to
    a steady net increase of the gravitational stress within the resonance node, which
    eventually leads to the creation of the high-curvature tentacle. An analogy of
    this is the laser, which builds up a highly coherent and intense beam of electromagnetic
    energy by enclosing oscillators within a reflecting cavity.\n\nThe distance between
    the two ends of the wormhole depends on the mass of the suns in the binary system
    and on what resonance node the jump gate is located. In order to connect two jump
    gates a trial-and-error method is needed, often lasting many years. This is because
    the tentacle created by the tensor-field cannot be controlled or directed in where
    to open. But by having another jump gate in a nearby system build up gravitational-stress
    in it its own, without reaching critical point, at the same time that the tentacle
    is growing, then the likelihood of a connection being made increases statistically,
    although many attempts are still often needed. This is similar to raising a metal
    rod in a thunder storm.\n\nThe first jump gate versions built by the Amarrians
    were limited in the way that once a wormhole had been created and a ship slipped
    through a new wormhole had to be made before another ships could pass. As it could
    take several days or even months to re-connect the two jump gates, passing was
    slow. Later versions of jump gates allowed the jump gates to hold the wormhole
    open for a longer time and modern day jump gates can keep a wormhole connection
    open for several dozen years before it has to be reset. Also, the first jump gates
    were only able to connect and hold a single wormhole at a time but today they
    can hold several wormholes open at the same time, allowing jump gates to be connected
    to several other jump gates at once.\n\nIn an average binary system the jump gate
    has a range of around 5 light-years, provided the jump gate is constructed on
    the third resonance node. More powerful jump gates can be constructed on the second
    resonance node between the stars. Because these nodes are much farther from a
    solar system (often up to 0.5 lightyear away) and, more importantly, are also
    harder to harness, they have only recently started to be utilized. On the other
    hand, they have much greater range than the basic jump gates.\n\nThere are several
    strict limitations on jump gate travel. First of all, jump gates can only be constructed
    in systems with two or more suns, because of the resonance nodes. This effectively
    makes one in every three systems ineligible for jump gate construction.\n\nSecondly,
    only one jump gate can be in operation in a system at any given time. This is
    due to the erratic fluctuations in the resonance fields caused by a mass boson
    sphere; if more than one such sphere is active at the same time in the same system,
    they both become highly unstable and impossible to operate.\n\n>![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/62930/1/jump_teng_done.gif#left)\n>
    \n> *When the ship goes through the mass boson sphere, a mono-atomic layer of
    mass boson gets deposited on the ships surface.*\n\nAnd thirdly, ships can only
    travel through wormholes if both ends of it are connected to a jump gate. This
    means that ships must travel between systems in normal space in order to build
    a jump gate. The reason for this is the extreme dilatation of the metric along
    the longitudinal dimension of the tentacle, meaning that the spatial coordinate
    along the length of the wormhole is expanded, while the radial component is cyclically
    curved. A spaceship entering the wormhole is subject to a strong metric gradient
    that would put its structural integrity in jeopardy. \n\nThis can be prevented
    by locally countering the stretching around the immediate vicinity of the ship.
    Here the mass boson sphere plays its second role in the gate mechanism. When the
    ship goes through the mass boson sphere, a mono-atomic layer of mass boson gets
    deposited on the ships surface. This layer counters the stretching of the ship
    against the metric gradient, enough to keep the structural integrity of the ship
    for the duration of the trip through the hole. This doesn't mean that the gradient
    is completely wiped out, and even seasoned space veterans still know the feeling
    known as 'going down the drain' when entering a wormhole.\n\n##  4 - Space vessels
    get a boost \u2013 the first jump drives.\n\nEven with advanced propulsion systems
    it took space ships days or weeks to move between planets in a solar system. Anything
    that could quicken this travel was thus of immense interest for everybody.\n\nVarious
    efforts were made to increase the speed of ships, but most of them failed either
    because of too high fuel volume and cost, or because they were too limited in
    scope. The most successful attempt was that of the old Minmatar Empire, which
    built acceleration gates that employed gravity in an unique way to slingshot ships
    between planets. This gave the ships enough momentum to fly between planets in
    a much shorter time than before. But the Minmatars never discovered how to build
    inter-stellar jump gates, so their acceleration gates were limited to their home
    system (where they still exist today). They had begun experimenting with much
    larger acceleration gates capable of sending ships between solar systems, but
    they never got a chance to build them before the Amarrians invaded and enslaved
    the Minmatars.\n\nThe Amarr Empire itself was slow to make any breakthroughs in
    this regard, despite their ever-growing space empire. For a long time they made
    do with ships traveling at ca. 10% of the speed of light, this speed seemed sufficient
    to them. At last they discovered the principles behind jump drive technology more
    or less accidentally, while researching new weapon technologies. The first Amarrian
    jump drive was built nearly 300 years ago.\n\n>![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/62930/1/jump_atlast.jpg#left)\n>
    \n> *At last the Amarr Empire discovered the principles behind jump drive technology
    more or less accidentally, while researching new weapon technologies.*\n\nThe
    situation was different for the Gallenteans and Caldari. Their home planets were
    in the same system and this meant that intra-system trade runs became an important
    element in their society right from the outset of their space activity. Thus there
    was a much greater incentive to find an acceptable solution to intra-system travel.
    The first jump drive built is the Sotiyo-Urbaata Drive, built by Caldari engineers
    more than 600 years ago. It was immensely big, tremendously expensive and outrageously
    inefficient, but it worked. The Sotiyo-Urbaata Drive, along with later versions,
    sped considerably up the social and technological development for both the Gallenteans
    and the Caldari and is without a doubt one of the most important discoveries ever
    made.\n\nSince their first appearance all these long centuries ago, jump drives
    have become ever more advanced, making them cheaper, more reliable and more efficient.
    Yet the difference between the Sotiyo-Urbaata Drive and a modern day drive is
    not so great; both work on the same underlying principle, both allow very fast
    travel within the solar system. But the latest versions of jump drives are for
    many the true jump drives, for they allow ships to traverse solar systems even
    where there are no jump gates. These revolutionary jump drives, which are still
    relatively rare and expensive, combine traditional jump drive technology with
    jump gate technology and create a whole new piece of equipment.\n\n##  5 - Faster-than-light
    travel \u2013 how?\n\nSo what is the elusive answer to FTL travel? It was found
    through advanced research in the field of quantum electrodynamics. By creating
    depleted vacuum, that is, vacuum as found in space but completely stripped of
    all energy, and then expanding this depleted vacuum to envelop a ship, the ship
    is capable of moving faster than light through this bubble of depleted vacuum.
    A depleted vacuum bubble is more than frictionless \u2013 it is so anti-friction
    that things (including light) actually move faster in it than they would in complete
    vacuum.\n\n>![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/62930/1/jump_jumpDrive.jpg#left)\n>
    \n> *The jump drive creates depleted vacuum by repeatedly 'compressing' vacuum
    between two polar dishes, draining all energy neutrons and quarks out of it.*\n\nAll
    space ships are equipped with a jump drive device. The jump drive creates depleted
    vacuum by repeatedly \u2018compressing\u2019 vacuum between two polar discs, draining
    all energy neutrons and quarks out of it. A laser-locked field is then created
    to hold the ever-increasing depleted vacuum bubble until it has enveloped the
    whole ship. When that happens the ship is able to enter FTL speed. Although initial
    experiments with the jump drive were very encouraging technology wise, problems
    arose in regard to navigation. Once the ship has attained FTL speed, it is very
    difficult for it to act or react to the world, such as for communication or scanning
    purposes. Numerous experiments were made, for example with compactified dimensions
    radio, but without success. \n\nThe unpredictable nature of quantum mechanics
    made it very difficult to create a stable enough vacuum bubbles to allow for precise
    time measurements due to fluctuating speeds. Finally, a solution was found. It
    was discovered that gravity capacitors similar to the control system used in jump
    gates were able to pick up gravity signals from \u2018normal\u2019 space while
    the ship was on FTL speed. By locking the capacitor onto one of these signals,
    the ship travels to it. The bubble is then automatically dispersed once certain
    distance from the gravity well is acquired. The only problem is that these capacitors
    can only efficiently pick up signals from gravity wells of certain size or above,
    with the minimum being a small moon or a cluster of asteroids. \n\nAlso, in order
    for the gravity capacitor to align correctly on the destination object in relevance
    to the position of the sun, it must follow a relatively narrow route towards it,
    resulting in a fairly restricted emerge area for the ship. This puts some limits
    on the jump drive\u2019s usage, but as all major objects in a system can be detected,
    this is not such a great problem. Furthermore, it is now possible to construct
    \u2018fake\u2019 gravity wells on space stations and jump gates, which can be
    detected and thus homed onto by the gravity capacitor that is part of a ship\u2019s
    jump drive.\n\nFurther research into jump drives, especially those aimed at amalgamating
    the technology used for jump drives and the one used for jump gates, has led to
    more and more advanced jump drives becoming available. It is now possible to fit
    a ship with a jump drive capable of inter-stellar travel. The first versions of
    these allowed the jump drive to connect to a jump gate in another solar system
    and jump to it just as if the ship had moved through a jump gate. The later versions
    allow ships to jump from a system with a jump gate to another system that has
    no jump gate, and the latest version, still only available as a prototype, allows
    a ship to jump between systems even if no jump gate exists in either system. \n\nThe
    first versions of these drives simply aligned the drive with the nearest resonance
    node in the system (often using nodes 1:4 or even 1:5), then created instant mini-wormholes
    through it for just enough time for the ship to slip through. More advanced versions,
    allowing jumps into systems with no jump gates, are a bit more complex. They send
    out a constant barrage of high frequency neutron rays, based on the flat-space
    principle of trans-relativistic physics, through infinitesimal cosmic strings
    to scout out the destination system. This survey can last for several days before
    enough data is gathered to allow the ship to create a wormhole (through a resonance
    node of course) to the destination system.\n\n##  6 - About the author.\n\nAlain
    Embrosius Topher has a degree in applied physics and experimental psychology from
    the Caille University on Gallente Prime. Topher, a brilliant but unruly student,
    signed up with an exploration company after his graduation and spent the next
    twenty years roaming around remote solar systems, collecting astrophysical data.
    He has always been enthusiastic about foreign and alien cultures and the main
    reason for his exploration scurries was the hope to discover alien artifacts.
    Until now he has not found any artifacts older than a few thousand years old and
    all which are of obvious human origin.\n\nHaving amassed a sizeable sum during
    his days with the exploration company, Topher finally decided to try his luck
    on his own and spent the next few years combing several promising systems. Working
    alone, or at most with a couple of assistants, made these excursions highly dangerous,
    and thus prime entertainment material. Topher made a deal with one of the largest
    entertainment network in the Gallente Federation to make vid programs about his
    adventures. These became hugely popular for a while, but the lack of bug-eyed
    monsters or glittering treasures soon turned the public indifferent. Topher, who
    had thrived in the limelight, decided to shelve his excursions for a while in
    favor of taking more exciting (and lucrative) excursions in vid studios.\n\n>![](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/62930/1/jump_author.jpg#left)\n>
    \n> *Long regarded as a stylish quack with a lot of weird ideas among his fellow
    scientists, Topher's recent studies and papers have earned him long-overdue respect
    from many of his peers*\n\nTopher was content to live the life of a vid star for
    some years, but in the end the scientist in him begged for attention. Feeling
    too old to start running around barren planets again, Topher settled instead on
    making education shows and info clips, often in the form of games of some sort.
    Yet again he hit the jackpot and for billions of Gallenteans Topher is a household
    name associated with education and knowledge.\n\nNow in his early nineties, Topher
    is finally settling down to a quiet academic life. His vid appearances are now
    few and far between and instead he\u2019s focusing on pure science, more or less
    for the first time in his life. Long regarded as a stylish quack with a lot of
    weird ideas among his fellow scientists, his recent studies and papers has earned
    him long-overdue respect from many of his peers."
