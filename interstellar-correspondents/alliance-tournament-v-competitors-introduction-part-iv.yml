    include a number of new, smaller and mostly unknown alliances as well as the established
    tournament veterans. \n\nNext in our series of Alliance introductions, we present
    **_Blood Blind_**. \n\n**Blood Blind (ABUSE)**\n\n* * *\n\nWhile Blood Blind alliance,
    also known as ABUSE, was founded late in 109, its 7 member corporations hold a
    great deal of piracy expertise. Executor kessah told me that she tries to instill
    the traditional practice of ransoming in her members \u2013 a patient art requiring
    both strong combat abilities and the ability to assess your opponent\u2019s mental
    state. \n\n\u201CI believe [intimidation] can be used as a powerful tool, without
    doubt that is certain. There are a lot of quality teams in the tournament, but
    its also a curse. Being a pirate inevitably emits the reputation of a battle-hardened
    killer and being 'underestimated' is also another powerful psychology to play
    against a team.\u201D \n\nKessah founded the alliance when her piratical resume
    reached the point where the only next step was to create her own organization,
    and the alliance members have the rare distinction of being chosen after fighting
    against the other corporations of Blood Blind. In this way, they have extended
    their influence from Lonetrek to Aridia where they and Veto Corp nip at each other\u2019s
    borders, or tangle with anti-piracy forces. \n\nWhile kessah herself flew for
    The Red Skull in a match in the last tournament, this is her first with her own
    alliance, and they are keen to make the tournament an experience open to all their
    pilots. \n\n\u201CI won\u2019t deny the nerves I went through fighting that one
    match last time, but I\u2019m ready. I\u2019m proud and confident my team will
    back me up and provide me with experienced advice. \n\n\u201CThis event in a way
    gave me the energy and will to push forward a team to compete. [It\u2019s] not
    just about who has the trained skills\u2026 but who ultimately puts in the most
    effort. It\u2019s everyone\u2019s right in Blood Blind to compete if they so wish.\u201D
    \n\nAs that fateful 15:00 start ticks ever closer, Blood Blind have a large pool
    of pilots willing and able to join the fight. They are testing and narrowing down
    their tactics prior to making the final choices for their roster, and seem to
    have settled on a final plan. \n\nWhen I asked kessah to describe their strategy,
    she gave me one word: \n\n\u201CInteresting.\u201D \n\n* * *\n\n_More coverage
    will be available live during the tournament. Blood Blind will have its first
    fight on Day One against The Kadeshi._"
