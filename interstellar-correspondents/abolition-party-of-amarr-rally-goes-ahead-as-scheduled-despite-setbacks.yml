    has gone from strength to strength. This Thursday saw their third rally in as
    many weeks, where they were trying to gather support for their cause, and send
    their messages to the hearts of the governments of whose systems they choose to
    rally in. And with each rally, more pilots of all races voice their support, most
    importantly perhaps the many Matari freedom fighter corporations who, although
    initially sceptical and mistrustful of her intentions are starting to welcome
    her as an equal.   \n  \nThis fame and recognition however, has come at a price.
    Mere hours before the rally was to take place, in which Shira d\u2019Radonis,
    the founder of the Abolition party of Amarr was to take a prominent role, the
    anti-slavery supporters received terrible news. Shira was lured into a trap by
    another abolition party supporter and was assassinated.   \n  \nMyadra, the assassin,
    had been posing as an anti-slavery sympathiser for days so that she could get
    close to Shira and then used that relationship to bring her to a concord-unprotected
    system where she could carry out the deed. Myadra freely admits to killing Shira,
    claiming that she was doing Gods work in executing a traitor to the Amarr Empire.
    \u201CI have no remorse for doing what god wanted me to do\u201D, she said when
    questioned about the incident.   \n  \nReprisals against Myadra were swift and
    the level of anger shocked even her. Within hours of the assassination, sympathisers
    had placed a staggering 40 million ISK bounty on her head and many pilots have
    vowed to hunt her down for betraying them all. There has even been talk of war
    being declared against Myadras corporation, rumours which have forced Myadra to
    go into hiding and her corporation to set a deadline of her resignation, no later
    than the 21st.   \n  \n\u201CI admit, I am worried\u201D, she said. \u201CI had
    plans to re-gain concords favour, by going into deep space and ridding it of some
    angel pirates\u201D. But now the damage is done and the bounty on her head won\u2019t
    be lifted until she is hunted down, and even then that will be no guarantee of
    a fresh start for her.   \n  \nDespite the assassination, the planned rally went
    ahead. This time in front of the Chief Executive Panel Bureau in New Caldari.
    Because of Shiras weakened state, Father Perigo Kinzam, another Abolition party
    member, took over as the leader of the rally, and started it with a prayer from
    the Pax and paid tribute to Shira.   \n  \nUnfortunately, although the rally did
    manage to gather many people, both pro, and anti slavery, the force of their convictions
    managed to pull the gathering apart, with heated arguments flying across the local
    communications network. This was compounded by the fact that Myadra showed up
    to taunt the protesters, just before she went into hiding. As none of them could
    fire upon her in the high security space, they had to endure her presence. The
    rally organisers admitted that they had learned from the experience and that they
    would have to organise future rallies more tightly so that they could maintain
    a proper orderly gathering.   \n  \nSo where next? Shira hinted at the next rally
    being in one of the two friendly empires, the Matari, or the Gallente. Even though
    those empires have banned and detest slavery, she is determined to get their message
    out to as many people as possible. She pointed out that there is a long road ahead
    before everyone could be united, but it is achievable, during that time she, and
    her followers would work diligently to try and bring as many people onto the road
    of peace as she can."
