    their 53rd - \u201C2 year anniversary\u201D - round with a special lottery. Regular
    BIG lotteries only feature one winner, claiming the first prize of 250,000,000
    isk. This time however to reflect the special occasion BIG has doubled the first
    prize and added other prizes, including a variety of Tech II times. We at the
    Interstellar Correspondents department have managed to get in contact with BIG\u2019s
    CEO TornSoul for a few questions regarding this rounds lottery. Mr. TornSoul,
    what is special about your 2 year anniversary lottery? \u201CWell, the one very
    special thing about it is that it is in fact a 2 year anniversary. Those are rare.
    But I know what you are aiming at of course. What makes this round special - the
    53rd round by the way - Is the huge amount of prizes we have got lined up to mark
    the occasion. Usually the BIG Lottery sports just a single cash prize, \"Winner
    takes it all\" style.\u201D What are the chances of actually winning something?
    \u201CWell, to answer that \u2013 I would need to know how many tickets are sold
    - which I don\u2019t. But taking the last rounds as basis, i.e. the amount of
    tickets sold the last rounds. Then the chance is around 10-15% to win *something*.\u201C
    How many people usually participate in BIG\u2019s lotteries and how many tickets
    are sold on average? \u201CThe last many rounds it has been between 100-120 each
    round and around 200-250 thousand tickets sold, corresponding to 200M-250M ISK.\u201D
    You have held special lotteries in the past, what are you expectations in participations
    for this round of you lottery? \u201CWell... it is very hard to speculate about...
    I would guess around 3 times as many participants as usual. Some of the prizes
    offered are rather sought after - and most importantly - hard to get by usually.
    'Rare' Tech2 ships especially.\u201D Concluding the interview Ms. TornSoul, added
    the following comment. At an anniversary you always tend to 'look back' a bit.
    I am very happy and surprised that I'm able to look that far back - 2 years...
    I would like to use the chance to thank all those who over the years - Never thought
    I would be able to say that about the BIG Lottery - have taken part. The BIG Lottery
    is only there because people actually think it is fun to take part So, thanks
    to all those who have taken part over the years - and in the end made the BIG
    Lottery the record running success it is The ticket price for this special round
    is 1,000 ISK with a maximum of 5000 tickets per character and the winners will
    be drawn on May 23rd at 1800 Eve time. For further details of how to participate,
