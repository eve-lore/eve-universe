    to their clients in New Eden. We take a look at the workings of one of them in
    an interview with their leaders. \n\nThe Interstellar Correspondents managed to
    obtain an interview with Gabrial1, Hans Gates and Jezala of Repo Industries during
    which origin, organization and contracts was discussed. During the interview of
    the three CEOs, it was an engaging and informative look at a thriving example
    of this niche industry. \n\nAmeron Silent: Gabrial11, I must say people are impressed
    on the things about Repo Industries an would like to know more from the force
    behind it as your foes and friends all hold you in high regard \n\nGabrial1: Thank
    you, we try to do good work and have a good time doing it we try to maintain a
    good relation ship with both it helps recruiting and future contracts. \n\nAmeron
    Silent: Can you tell us how Repo Industries came about? \n\nGabrial1: A group
    of us pilots decided to group together and try our hand at the mercenary business.
    After about two or three months we saw potential in it and decided to get a little
    more serious about it. \n\nAmeron Silent: So the true potential for it became
    known then. \n\nAmeron Silent: What would you say has been its success in lasting
    as long and creating the name it has? \n\nGabrial1: I believe it is a few things,
    selective recruiting being one, we are a team and a group of friends who want
    to survive and make ISK only through PVP. So we only accept likeminded pod pilots
    with high proficiency in the art of pod combat that are very aggressive that can
    work in a team environment and be self motivating. \n\nAmeron Silent: What was
    it like in your early days where you used as fodder, for idealism, revenge, what
    helped shape you back then? \n\nGabrial1: It was very simple we were flying with
    a small group of us that had been together for years. \n\nAmeron Silent: Some
    mercenary corps fight for Idealism and ISK and some for straight ISK, what do
    you fight for? \n\nGabrial1: Honestly we fight for fun and the ISK benefit. \n\nAmeron
    Silent: What would be Repo's greatest assignment to date? \n\nGabrial1: Novus
    Ordos Seclorum I believe it was called. At that time Repo had broken one small
    empire alliance. we set our sights on NOS as we saw a vulnerability with them
    since they were indirectly getting attacked in 0.0. We exploited every opportunity
    and wore them down over about a month. \n\nAmeron Silent: So this was done without
    a sponsor then? \n\nGabrial1: Yes it was an in corp operation just to see if we
    could do it. It stood out because we saw when they disbanded that we really were
    as a small corp a very big player if we did things right. \n\nAmeron Silent: What
    about the worst assignment then? \n\nGabrial1: Other than the dreaded target corp
    staying docked and not wishing to engage us. \n\nAmeron Silent: How did the name
    Repo come about? \n\nGabrial1: Jezala thought of the name, however the ticker
    MUCC was a joke geared towards Hans Gates and myself. \n\nAmeron Silent: How so,
    MUCC at 1st glance make me think of mud or muck? \n\nGabrial1: Years ago Hans
    Gates and I were the semi carebear type and we met each other in this mining corp
    named mining unlimited the ticker was MUC. \n\nAmeron Silent: So it was a return
    to your roots per say then? \n\nGabrial1: It was Jezala's way of making fun of
    Hans and I.I have actually petitioned the ticker hoping to get it changed to Repo.
    MUCC seems to confuse people. \n\nAmeron Silent: For clients, do you take contracts
    from individual pod pilots to Alliance? \n\nGabrial1: Yes we accept contracts
    from anyone with ISK. \n\nAmeron Silent: What fee and time limit is normally set?
    \n\nGabrial1: We don\u2019t like taking flat rate contracts we prefer pay per
    kill. If we aren\u2019t fulfilling the clients needs he doesn\u2019t have to pay
    if we kill many of them we make more ISK. It inspires our members to get kills.
    \n\nAmeron Silent: Ok, so using a per kill method then this can make it easier
    to prevent another corp from buying you out of a contract then? \n\nHans Gates:
    We have never been bought out of a contract, we have however accepted surrender
    fees from leaving corps. Mainly for us not to pursue. \n\nJezala: To be honest,
    I don't think anyone has really ever tried buying out our contract. \n\nHans Gates:
    Most clients, look for a certain target, or complete destruction. \n\nGabrial1:
    I have been approached by a target leader who wanted to pay me more than the client
    was paying. We believe it would be unethical and bad business to ever except such
    a thing for any amount of ISK. The target wanted us to retract war on them and
    target our client. \n\nAmeron Silent: Ever have a problem with clients? \n\nHans
    Gates: To be honest, I have killed 2 current clients while on contract for them.
    \n\nAmeron Silent: You had to terminate 2 clients? Why for? \n\nHans Gates: They
    were clients in the wrong place wrong time. \n\nAmeron Silent: This did not hurt
    the wallet? \n\nJezala: It's how we've structured our business....normally only
    the contracting officer knows the identity of the client. \n\nGabrial1: we have
    a contract officer and most of the time neither Jezala, Hans nor myself do not
    even know the client. \n\nAmeron Silent: I can see how that may cause a accident.
    I hope that did not hurt the wallet. \n\nHans Gates: Nope, we got another contract
    from him shortly after. \n\nAmeron Silent: In Jezala\u2019s bio \"I am a BOB pet\"
    is that your view or a corp view? \n\nBoth Hans Gates and Gabrial1 laugh at this
    idea. \n\nHans Gates: It was a statement on the forums. \n\nHans Gates: Jez seems
    to have liked it. \n\nAmeron Silent: So it is a joke? \n\nJezala: Hehe, when the
    Providence campaign started we were being accused of being hired by BoB. \n\nAmeron
    Silent: Then a mercenaries you stand alone. \n\nGabrial1: Yes we are totally independent.
    \n\nHans Gates: We do however know a lot of pod pilots, and can call on some assistance
    if needed. \n\nAmeron Silent: Your reputation is very good, for being one of the
    hundreds of Corps in the Mercenary field. Good Hunting"
