    second [\"Ships Of Eve Lottery\" (SOE2) was proclaimed open](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a%3Dtopic%26threadID%3D1127200)
    on the 24.07.111. Tickets are 10 million ISK each and top prizes include a Guardian
    Vexor and a package of 215 different ships.  \n  \nLaunching just two weeks after
    the first [Ships of Eve Lottery](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?article=3189),
    SOE2 aims to offer entertainment to all capsuleers participating the event beyond
    the act of simply buying a ticket.  \n  \n[![A Guardian Vexor Waiting For A New

    jackpot ticket will allow the winner to choose between a valuable Guardian Vexor
    or 215 ships including T3 vessels and subsystems of choice.  \n  \nAccording to
    organizer T'Amber, the lottery has been engineered so that \"everyone can have
    a good time without having to spend any ISK\".  \n  \nThe first lottery's formula
    has been developed to meet capsuleers' demands: rare and collectable ships, more
    prize levels, spot prizes, a greater social element and ultimately more drama.
    \ \n  \nFor those who cannot afford to buy a ticket, entry can be obtained by
    competing in side events. 2%-3% of the total tickets will be allocated as prizes
    for these events.  \n  \nOne of the side events is a race which will be held during
    the coming weekend. Race entry will be free and pilots will be required to run
    through lowsec to an undisclosed destination. Lottery tickets will be awarded
    to all capsuleers completing the race using different ship classes.  \n  \nOf
    the fifty original guardian vexors less than twenty are suspected to be still
    flying. The rare Gallente cruiser is equipped with one extra missile hardpoint
    and can control a maxmum of 10 drones; the ship's value is estimated at upwards
    of 10 billion ISK.  \n  \nThe \"Ships of Eve 2\" lottery is open now and is scheduled
    to close on 07.08.111, with a number of spot prizes being given out in the last
    24 hours before the draw.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this article?
