- body: "Events in Mabnen were brought to a new level last week when the infamous
    freedom fighter alliance the Ushra\u2019Khan entered the fray, transporting thousands
    of tons of supplies and aid to the Minmatar Freedom Extension station in orbit
    around Mabnen VII, allocated for distribution to the beleaguered slaves on Mabnen
    I. Traveling in a fleet of 60-70 ships, the convoy of Ushra\u2019Khan and other
    loyalist Matari ships left Pator early Sunday evening and proceeded to travel
    to Mabnen, where the aid was collected and distribution began. Reports indicate
    that it is still being transported to areas of Mabnen I which were devastated
    by the riots and responsive Ammarian air strikes; however a significant amount
    has already reached some of the most desperate.   \n  \nThe convoy, however, may
    not have just been transporting aid supplies to the slaves \u2013 some sources
    have indicated that while in Mabnen the Ushra\u2019Khan fleet secretly deployed
    several armored battalions of marines planetside along with a large amount of
    extra weapons and vehicles for the revolting slaves. Whilst the official line
    from the Ushra\u2019Khan council is that no military force was deployed, the vast
    discrepancy in the total cargo hold space of the aid convoy and the tonnage of
    aid delivered disputes this claim.   \n  \nA confirmed report of an event such
    as this could significantly damage Minmatar -Amarr relations \u2013 the deployment
    of Minmatar armed forces on an Ammarian world is something the universe has not
    seen since the great rebellion, over 100 years ago.   \n  \nThe lack of reaction
    from the Emperor on these events is certainly worrying for the citizens of Amarr
    \u2013 the normally heavily secured planets of the empire allowing a known freedom
    fighting element to distribute unwarranted aid and possibly even deploy troops
    within Ammarian sovereign space sets a precedent for other such operations in
    the near future \u2013 combine these with the increasing Blood Raider menace and
    there looks as if some very trying times are ahead for the Amarr Empire."
