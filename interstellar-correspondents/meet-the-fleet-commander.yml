- body: "There are only a handful of highly visible and successful Fleet Commanders
    in the Federal Defence Union. Today's focus is on Elijah Ghost, a member of Pillowsoft
    corporation [PILLO].\n\nElijah obtained his pilot's license two and a half years
    ago. He has been with Pillowsoft on and off during his entire career.  The formation
    of the FDU has given him a reason to stay around longer this time.\n\nThe formation
    of the militia has also allowed Elijah to test his hard earned skills and experience
    in the defense of the Federation, albeit with mixed results early on: \"I was
    the first FC, and lead the first 60 man fleet to their death.\uFEFF The second
    fleet I [commanded] was an hour later and I lead 30 against 50 and won, with minimal
    losses.\"\n\nDespite his inauspicious debut, Elijah has gained valuable experience
    and now forms regular roaming fleets centered around the star system of Villore.
    Although State Protectorate pilots tend to dock up as quickly as possible at the
    sight of an Elijah Ghost fleet, Elijah still perseveres on his pursuit to destroy
    any State pilot he can find outside of a station's docking ring.\n\nWhen asked
    how long he intends on leading fleets, he states: \"Until my CEO boots me from
    the corp, or we leave the militia... Personally, I'm here until we win.\"\n\nWith
    the constant shifting of system control, pilots are becoming worn and frustrated.
    As Elijah reminds us: \"... it doesn't appear to be going anywhere. Caldari captured
    more systems than we did at one point, then we had their systems, and now they're
    back on top by 1 system.\"\n\nThe one question Elijah ponders is: \"... if we
    had a date of when the war was going to end, would people fight harder?\"\n\nAll
    militia pilots are welcome, and encouraged to join Elijah's fleets based out of
    Villore."
