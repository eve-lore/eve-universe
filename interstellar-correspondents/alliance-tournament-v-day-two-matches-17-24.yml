- body: "Welcome to Day Two of the **Fifth Alliance Tournament**. Here are the initial
    results and reviews of the first eight matches. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 17: Blood
    Blind Vs Molotov Coalition**\n\nA second win and a totalhelldeath marked what
    has become an impressive showing by Molotov Coalition in this year\u2019s tournament.
    \n\n**Blood Blind:** Armageddon | Scorpion | Huginn | Curse | Arbitrator  \n**Molotov
    Coalition:** 2 Armageddons | 2 Guardians | 2 Punishers\n\nWith the a Curse dropping
    almost instantly, it looked over from the beginning for the pirates of Blood Blind.
    Next under fire was the Arbitrator, which surprised many by lasting far longer,
    suggesting the reason behind the Curse loss was simply a lack of immediate logistics
    support. For a moment there was a stalemate, but a spread of fire and some smart
    FC\u2019ing saw Molotov eventually break the logistics chain and come away with
    a victory. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 18: The Star Fraction Vs When Fat Kids Attack**\n\nBacked
    into a corner due to yesterday\u2019s loss, The Star Fraction bounced back with
    a win against When Fat Kids Attack. \n\n**The Star Fraction:** 5 Cerburus | 5
    Griffins  \n**When Fat Kids Attack:** 3 Abaddons | Rook | Tristan\n\nFielding
    a team identical to that used yesterday by their old enemies The Fourth District,
    The Star Fraction had a fortuitous turn of events with FATTY losing an Abaddon
    almost as the fight began. Capitalizing on the weakened logistics, they slowly
    whittled the oppositions Rook down, destroying the Tristan along with it. They
    looked set to come home with a much-needed totalhelldeath, but at the end stage
    of the fight lost a single Griffin \u2013 leaving what should be a tough fight
    for second place in the group against The Kadeshi. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 19: Hydra
    Alliance Vs Green Alliance**\n\nFielding a unique setup, Green Alliance continued
    their strong showing to come away with both a win and the second totalhelldeath
    of the day (and for them so far in the tournament.) \n\n**Hydra Alliance:** 5
    Ishtars | 5 Griffins   \n**Green Alliance:** Prophecy | 2 Ishtars | 3 Rifters
    | Republic Fleet Firetail\n\nAnother match featuring the tried and tested 5 HAC
    and 5 Griffin teams, this time however, unsuccessfully. With multiple Hydra Griffins
    taking damage immediately from a spread of fire, the fight looked in Green Alliance\u2019s
    favor early on. Not managing to break the logistics chain of their opponents,
    Hydra soon saw the first of their Ishtars taking heavy damage. This fight; between
    two of yesterday\u2019s winners, determined who would take the top place in their
    group. With two very convincing wins so far from Green Alliance, they\u2019re
    currently looking like a short-odds favorite for the Tournament Cup. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match
    20: SMASH Alliance Vs Notoriety Alliance**\n\nChanging their setup from yesterday
    SMASH Alliance met another loss, this time against Notoriety Alliance who made
    an impressive first showing today. \n\n**SMASH Alliance:** 2 Basilisks | Sacrilege
    | Vagabond | 3 Manticores  \n**Notoriety Alliance:** 2 Basilisks | 3 Phantasms
    | 2 Sentinels | Rifter\n\nThis fight saw an unconventional and masterfully-used
    team formation from Notoriety, who fielded Sentinels and Phantasms, both previously
    unseen in the tournament. The savage alpha-strike from the Phantasms proved too
    difficult for the dual-Basilisks to counteract, and the Manticores began to fall
    very quickly. With some clever target-switching and capacitor neutralization from
    Notoriety, they managed to drop both Basilisks rapidly thereafter, coming away
    with today\u2019s third totalhelldeath. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 21: Pandemic Legion
    Vs Cry Havoc.**\n\nOnce again, two winners from yesterday vied for top placing
    in their group, this match resulted in a draw for both sides, and the first one
    of the tournament. \n\n**Pandemic Legion:** Raven | 2 Basilisks | Curse | Daredevil
    | 3 Vigils  \n**Cry Havoc.:** Raven | Guardian | 2 Ishtars | Curse\n\nThe effectiveness
    of logistics was proved once again, with neither side able to break the strong
    defenses of their competitors. Both teams fielded similar formations with weak
    damage output that was hard to spread \u2013 making it difficult for either side
    to kill a ship, let alone come away with a win. There were a few moments where
    a spread of damage took some ships into armor, such as Pandemic Legion\u2019s
    vigils, but with no ships eventually taken out, the match was called as a draw.
    \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 22: Mercenary Coalition Vs Ethereal Dawn**\n\nAlliance newcomers
    Ethereal Dawn delivered a second loss to Mercenary Coalition, whose unique yet
    sensible setup proved no match for the more traditional logistics-centric one
    fielded by their opponents. \n\n**Mercenary Coalition:** 5 Thorax | 2 Vexor Navy
    Issue | 3 Kitsune  \n**Ethereal Dawn:** Scorpion | 2 Basilisks | 2 Nemesis' |
    2 Manticores\n\nWith a Kitsune traded for a Nemesis early on in the fight, it
    was shaping up to be a very close one. The second Ethereal Dawn Nemesis failed
    to fall as quickly however, lasting for around five minutes \u2013 suggesting
    that the first fell to a lack of immediate logistics support. Left with only cruisers,
    MC\u2019s fate looked grim against the firepower of a Scorpion, which proved a
    successful variation on the traditional setup. It wasn\u2019t long until the first
    Thorax fell, the others following slowly but surely. A strong entry to the tournament
    from Ethereal Dawn who claimed a big scalp. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 23: Cosa Nostra.
    Vs Phalanx Alliance**\n\nIt was an absolute nail biter of a fight this time between
    the two group leaders fighting for top placement. Cosa Nostra. barely managing
    at times to cling on to a victory. \n\n**Cosa Nostra.:** 2 Megathrons | 2 Guardians
    | Vengeance  \n**Phalanx Alliance:** 2 Hyperions | 2 Falcons | Blackbird\n\nWith
    two close-range warp-ins from both teams, it was shaping up to be an epic slugfest
    between the two heavy-hitting vessels of the Federation fleet and it turned out
    to be just that. From the very beginning, both a Megathron and Hyperion were dipping
    deep into armor at the same time. A Phalanx Alliance Hyperion was the first casualty
    of the match, with a Cosa Nostra. Megathron following not long after. The impressive
    tanking ability of the remaining P.A Hyperion, coupled with well-deployed electronic
    warfare meant that the fight continued on for many minutes, impossible to call
    an outcome despite the seeming uphill battle left for P.A. \n\nWith each new jamming
    cycle on one of the Guardians, the Cosa Nostra. Megathron looked at many times
    like it might fall, but eventually it was the second P.A. Hyperion to be the next
    ship down, which was soon followed by the rest of its team. It was a well-formulated
    and masterfully executed plan from Cosa Nostra., who made every ship right down
    to their vengeance a key to their success. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 24: The Crimson
    Federation Vs Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate**\n\nThe Crimson Federation came
    away with a decisive win against Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate, grabbing a
    victory with a brutal onslaught that puts them back in the fight for their group.
    \n\n**The Crimson Federation:** Dominix | Hyperion | Abaddon | 5 Griffins | 2
    Maulus'  \n**Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate:** 2 Basilisks | Drake | 4 Moas\n\nIt
    was another close-range battle this time, with Crimson sitting on top of IAC before
    the match. With long-ranged Moa\u2019s sitting right beneath the brutal blasters
    of Crimson, it looked grim for IAC from the beginning. Tyraxx Thorrk\u2019s Basilisk
    came under immediate and savage fire from the beginning, dropping almost instantly
    under the onslaught. From there it was simply a matter of cleaning up the remains
    for Crimson, who despite a slowdown in the fighting still managed to come away
    with the win. \n\n* * *\n\n_Eve-TV Coverage: Day Two_  \n[View](http://www.eve-online.com/evetv/tunein.asp)"
