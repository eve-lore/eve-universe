    over the CVA and other Amarr loyalists; acquisition of one of the famed Imperial
    Issue Armageddons.   \n  \nIcarus Starkiller, the Minmatar who received the ship
    won it in the popular BIG lottery. The fact that an Armageddon was the prize had
    been massively publicised and many Minmatar put in their money hoping to win it
    and have something to show against the Amarr Empire. Fortunately for them, one
    of them won.   \n  \nThe Minmatar pilots jeered Warhound, the previous owner of
    the Armageddon, for betraying the Amarr and letting it ultimately fall into the
    hands of the Ushra\u2019Khan.   \n  \nIn a show of defiance, a large Ushra\u2019Kahn
    defence force escorted the ship from Tividu, in Amarr space, to their home system
    of Pator. Apart from one slight navigational error the trip was uneventful. Much
    to the disappointment of some pilots who were hoping to rub the information into
    the faces of the Amarr before attacking them, their journey was a secret that\u2019s
    been kept too well.   \n  \nThe ship is not planned to be used just as a trophy.
    Sources say that it will be employed to fight against the society which spawned
    it.   \n  \nAmarrian officials, when asked for their opinion withheld comment,
    for the most part. One, however, who preferred to be anonymous, had the following
    to say:   \n  \n\u201CIt's absolutely shameful. Mr. Starkiller, if that is indeed
    his name, has dishonored the Empire and all of the engineers, designers and shipyard
    workers who labored to bring this glorious vessel into being. This is an outrage!\u201D
    \  \n  \nWhatever the opinion of the Amarr, however, e can be sure that this Imperial
    Issue Armageddon will become the topic of more debate in the near future."
