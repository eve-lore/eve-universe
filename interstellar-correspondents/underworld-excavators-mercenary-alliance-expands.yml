    on the 16th of May 111, the alliance focuses on mercenary services such as protection
    of assets, pilots and provision of military services to corporations that request
    them.   \n  \nNew member corporations [Maelstrom Crew](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.eveonline.com%2Fwiki%2FMaelstrom_Crew_%2528Player_corporation%2529)

    between them house 83 pilots, tripling the size of the alliance. Both corporations
    had been active for some years as mercenary organizations in their own right before
    joining WHACK.  \n  \nLe Soltueur, Underworld Excavators' CEO, explained \"Aside
    from increasing the numbers of experienced mercenary [pilots], they've also helped
    to bolster our capital fleet which gives us a bit more leverage in low-sec.\"
    \  \n  \nKhul Drukath, CEO of Maelstrom Crew corporation, added that while his
    capsuleers prefer flying in small ships, they do not specialize in any particular
    tactic or ship class. Khul also offered insight on why his corporation joined
    Underworld Excavatiors: \"We felt that we had a lot in common and that there would
    be smooth integration.\"   \n  \nMercenaries are regarded by many as ruthless
    and unfair killers. Imperial'guard, former diplomat of Terminal Logic corporation,
    recalled a fight between Underworld Excavators and his former corporation. \"We
    were fighting them in Dodixie and they had more than 15 [neutral vessels] repping
    them.\" He did, however, feel that mercenary corporations are a necessary evil;
    \"They can help [corporations] that can't handle a fight, like [industrialists].\"
    \  \n  \nUnderworld Excavators plans to continue offering their expanded mercenary
    services but hope to use violence as a last resort. In a final statement, Le Solteur
    said \"[Combat] is a very expensive and extended engagement [that] can be diffused
    by simply opening some conversation.\"\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Roster of
