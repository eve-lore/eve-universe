    Placid** \\- The Intaki Liberation Front [ILF] are celebrating six months of a
    so far [successful 5-5 trade hub in Intaki](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=4000&tid=7),
    which has seen them so far raise 15 billion ISK in sales of ships and items.   \n
    \ \nApollonius Verus, ILF Director of Non-Combat Operations, seemed particularly
    happy that not only can capusleers purchase any type of small or medium tech 1
    ship but they can also outfit it with tech 1 or tech 2 gear, \"all without having
    to leave the Intaki system\".  \n  \nMaintaining such a trade hub has not been
    easy for the ILF, with mineral shortages causing problems early in the project's
    life. They say that they have now been \"noticed\" by mineral traders and, combining
    that with their own limited mining capabilities, now have a \"large enough store
    of minerals\" to keep their factories running for a long time.   \n  \nThe ISK
    generated is reinvested into four ongoing projects. The \"bulk\" of the ISK is
    put into the \"Ship Replacement Program\" and \"Anti-Pirate Bounty Program\".
    The rest of the ISK is spent on maintenance and infrastructure improvements to
    the ILF's \"Prosperity Station\" tower and on purchasing the blueprint copies
    they need. The \"Ship Replacement Program\" is a way the ILF pay back those capsuleers
    that offer them support by replacing ships lost to pirates. The \"Anti-Pirate
    Bounty Program\" is another incentive that sees capsuleers rewarded with ISK for
    any pirates destroyed in or around the Intaki system.   \n  \nApollonius said
    that the ILF is on course to hit the 30 billion \u200BISK target after twelve
    months thanks to support from Global Ring Trading Consortium, Ivan Svyatoslav
    of RedSun Industries, Melibeus Trading, and also G'Kar5 of Intaki Research and
    Manufacturing. He also wanted to welcome any traders who would like to set-up
    in the Intaki system as \"more competition leads to better prices\".   \n  \nThe
    Intaki system is a low-sec area and is under contant threat from Serpentis pirates
    and capsuleer pirate organizations, which is why the ILF offer such programs as
    incentives for capsuleers to help them and themselves in the process. The ILF
    say they have [always believed in helping the system and have worked dilligently
    to help with whatever problems the system has](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=3329&tid=7).
    \  \n  \nIn closing, Apollonius mentioned that the 1000th ship was recently sold
    at the trade hub. While this may not seem such a great achievement to traders
    in high-security space, growing such an endeavour in low-security space with a
    limited capsuleer population is far more difficult, which to Apollonius \"speaks
    volumes\" about how successful the trade hub has been.   \n  \nApollonius provided
    a short list of ships sold and their estimated sales values in the trade hub so
    far:\n\n  * Hurricane, 44 ships \\- for a total of 1,232,000,000 ISK\n  * Drake,
    28 ships \\- for a total of 868,000,000 ISK\n  * Myrmidon, 18 ships \\- for a
    total of 594,000,000 ISK\n  * Nemesis, 15 ships \\- for a total of 352,500,000
    ISK\n  * Harbinger, 13 ships \\- for a total of 390,000,000 ISK\n  * Manticore,
    12 ships \\- for a total of 222,000,000 ISK\n\n\n\nThe trade hub being developed
    by the Intaki Liberation Front in the Intaki V Moon 5 Astral Mining Inc. Refinery
    is now in its sixth month and on target to reach 30 billion in profit by the end
    of its first year.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this article?
