- body: "A little while ago, I had the pleasure to do a little research regarding
    the rumoured demise of the Curse Alliance. One of the people I interviewed was
    Gunship, ex Curse Alliance war general. While talking to him, it became apparent
    that he had a tale to tell. I decided to publish the tale, as it was told to me.
    \  \n  \nFrom CA nobody to War General.   \n  \n\\- By Gunship   \n  \nFirst of
    all, this is my story; there are thousand of stories. What you read here is based
    on facts (no lies), my facts, my views and my perception. Nothing more and nothing
    less. With that in mind the story starts roughly a year ago in a system a few
    jumps from Gehi.   \n  \nI was then part of NGRU (Northern Gorilla Reaver Unit).
    We hung out in CFS (Coalition of Free Stars) space, but not part of if. The CFS
    had some rather lengthy procedures to do almost anything; so that's why we did
    not properly join together with the fact that \"Tiester\" seemed a less than able
    leader. However, we were known to help out with CFSN (Coalition of Free Stars
    Navy) patrols and took part in minor skirmishes in the A2 area. Still, flying
    with the great white fleet, numbering over one hundred battleships to Amarr was
    fun until it turned into a mild chaos, in a nearby system.   \n  \nI can't remember
    who shot whose industrial ship, but that day, the Curse Alliance - CFS war broke
    out. We did not take part since we were not in CFS as full members and there was
    a secret connection between one of our members and Xirtam, which was a big secret.
    We happily let CA ships pass though our system, Xirtam made sure NGRU ships were
    clearly marked as non-hostile and we mined and hunted pirates while CFS generally
    got blown out of the sky (to say it politely).   \n  \nNGRU now was a corporation
    looking around for a new home and wanted to move out of empire space in search
    of richer mining fields, more worthy pirates to hunt and for some to use their
    lasers to less peaceful means. After having looked around we decided to make the
    move to CA even if we lost a pilot or two. I remember having to say goodbye to
    Kish as one of our biggest losses.   \n  \nThe move to CA space was special in
    a number of ways. We left CFS space (the war still in progress) in deepest secret
    and I still remember jumping into HED-GP and feeling a cold chill down my spin
    as I saw the massive fleet waiting for us. Thank god it was the welcoming escort,
    with our entire corps fleet completely drowned in Scorpions and other exotic ships,
    no wonder CFS had had a hard time. We were firmly handled and asked to jump systems
    on command, while fast moving scouts were double checking the space lanes, mumbling
    about getting us past U-Q. I recall thinking - what's U-Q? We safely arrived in
    CL-85 and started to adjust to 0.0 space, our miners complained about the local
    Angels (that was even before they came out in battleships) the fighters, mostly
    \"NGRU Storm\" was busy losing battleships to the Curse Coalition and the Great
    Wildlands Pact. I remember having 27 points Warp Core strength on my Apocalypse
    so I wouldn\u2019t to be scrambled by the amount of Scorpions flying around. However
    our new home system was infested by a small pirate corporation and I had to ask
    for help on the CA channel. A fast response unit consisting of Smith and another
    scorpion pilot responded with in a few minutes and proceeded to chase the intruders
    another 5-7 jumps away. It was a real eye opener for CA effectiveness compare
    with the five council meetings it would have taken CFS to decide to do nothing.
    \  \n  \nI slowly started to become more involved in fleet battles and fleet battles
    we did, a good one was in U-Q with our dear friends of SA. The going was a little
    rough but with mOo returning back from an op coming in from HED-GP it turned the
    tide somewhat. You see, CA politics is rather interesting; m0o was not really
    member of CA, since they are a pirate corporation and as you know we where not
    pirates apart from odd captains like Proxie or Zelota who had the odd gun misfiring
    at a passing ship. \"You have to let the young ones stretch there legs\" was the
    words from older pilots. However an understanding was in place and seeing a m0o
    ship was always reassuring for any CA pilot at the time.   \n  \nAnyway fighting
    at home was all well and good, but with CC and GWP out of the way a little visit
    to FA is not the worst the doctor can recommend, and I had a great time in what
    was a bit of fun for a few weeks, flying along side ATUK was always fun and rewarding
    among all the other CA's in the area.   \n  \nThe conquerable stations was a pain
    for CA, NGRU (and also RUS) was quick of the ball and took over a number of stations
    to start with and we gave them away to other CA corps as we saw fit, however ATUK
    came and took a mining post. The short and the long was that it all got too political.
    In the end at a council meeting ATUK said \u201Cwe know what we did was wrong,
    but we either keep the station or leave CA\u201D, so they got voted out. Looking
    back I shall be the first to lift my hand and say it was stupid and a silly pride
    thing. For the record; Xirtam at the time went to great lengths to solve the dispute,
    but both parties was firmly grounded. ATUK said we earned the right, NGRU saying
    we took it first. Looking back, it was one of the first times the more industrially
    minded people of CA got there own way. ATUK left without a fight, and later came
    back; NGRU helped to vote them back in, but the first damage was done. They later
    left again.   \n  \nM0o was kicked from CA for attacking Xetic (we had a NAP with
    them) another unique political decision. The war with m0o makes NGRU a little
    nervous and some of ours got cold feet. I decided to stay and fight and together
    with a few others I joined Vengeance of the Fallen.   \n  \nWhen m0o started to
    attack CA, ATUK got kicked for not wanting to fight m0o. As you can tell we weren\u2019t
    doing ourselves any favours. We later attacked Xetic for \u201Callowing\u201D
    m0o to use there space as a base, which makes perfect sense, right?   \n  \nHowever
    even after having \u201Clost\u201D two major fighting corps we gained other members
    like Corp1. CA was still going strong. So I joined a fighting corporation and
    the first thing I do is, I mine. Strip mining bistot near 0-W with 10-20 Apoc\u2019s
    ripping the belts apart together with another corp called backwater. It is hear
    I meet Foyle happily chatting away to Xirtam as an old couple. Backwater splits
    and Foyle\u2019s new corp sells ships etc to the fighters in HLW giving her a
    \u201Cgood name\u201D. She also moves production to near FA space when required.
    The civil war in SA resulted in OC joining CA and it almost bought SA to its knees.
    DSS was a ghost town to it\u2019s former self after repeated attacks. Older pilots
    will remember the changes that made frigates, specially the Kestrel, King of the
    hill. 4 cruise missiles, fast moving CA adopted this strategy to use it with full
    force. Honest Stain Alliance and CFS pilots will testify. A small rumble in VOTF
    happened when a few core pilots decide to split off and create their own group,
    Black Reign; I follow suit and join them shortly after.   \n  \nCA scientist kept
    coming up with new ship configurations and the dual 100mn afterburner Rupture
    takes to the stars and ghost fleets kills makes SA/CFS space hell. When the war
    with XETIC starts a new bigger and more deadly CA configuration has been battle
    proven. The dual MWD raven, rules the systems. The XETIC losses were extreme whatever
    anyone said, it got to hurt just a little to lose a little over two hundred Battleships
    in a week. Omega Corp extended there campaign in XETIC space and together with
    a few other Black Reign pilots I managed to get over 40 confirmed BS kill mail
    to my name in a month, hitting third place for BS kills on the excellent kill
    boards created by Jaabaa. Although I was pleased with my efforts, I\u2019m also
    telling you this so you get a flavor for how many ships got destroyed in CA\u2019s
    name.   \n  \nCA council was bored. We gained corporations who assured us they\u2019d
    fight. Many chose not to. Stations got put under the CA holding corporation with
    Foyle in charge as caretaker endorsed by the Duke and approved by the council.
    A mining tax of 15% was agreed on. Later, it was decided to sell 75% of all the
    minerals, I personally did this and it gave CA over 7 billion ISK\u2019s, enough
    start the alliance and to start the CA INSURANCE fund with a 1 bill starting balance.
    A good idea; newer pilots had complained and the system worked by collecting the
    loot and auctioned it of to help pilots who lost ships in battle under a CA squad
    leader or fleet commander. In the four to five months the system ran it paid out
    just under 3 billion ISK\u2019s and it managed to keep itself going (incoming
    loot = payouts). However when it turned out pilots where not prepared to fight
    unless they could get insurance it turned a little wrong in my view. The old saying:
    if you can\u2019t afford to lose it, don\u2019t fly it, still makes some sense.
    \  \n  \nCA has a war council, basically made up in the start of 5 of the main
    CEO\u2019s. When one left, Foyle, who has been a cornerstone in looking after
    the CA message boards and other communicating systems, wanted the title. Xirtam
    disagreed, he didn\u2019t think Foyle was suited, because she was not a fighter.
    Two capms came into being, those who believed a War General should be a trusted
    fleet commander and those who saw it more as a diplomatic title. Others extended
    it to 7 members and Foyle got in.   \n  \nThings ticks over for a little while
    with Xirtam taking an extended leave of absence. When he returned it became clear
    that CA had become tired of one of VOTF\u2019s members who even for CA posted
    once too many on the GalNet (Aneu Angellus). In short, the Council wanted him
    out. VOTF responded with the threat to leave if this Aneu was kicked out of the
    Allaince. The council votes for the proposal and VOTF leaves.   \n  \nAll this
    because of one pilot you ask? It runs deeper than that is all I know and all I
    care to know.   \n  \nHowever; Xirtam who was among the leaders that formed CA
    and by many seen as the true leader of CA in the first place started to look for
    a new place for his corporation. Many other corporations came to him and said
    \u201Cwhere you go, we follow\u201D. I assume he pressed a few buttons himself
    as well just for the record. It was after that council meeting (or in the end
    of it, I was not there) I got promoted by all to the position of \u201CWar General\u201D,
    I accepted and it was a great vote of confidence, but hardly in the best of circumstances.
    Other problems soon emerged with Shinra getting tired of fighting the same enemies
    on the same path as they had done for over a year (HLW to HED-GP). Supremacy was
    fighting away from home while all this took place, so numbers were not great and
    HLW was no longer powerhouse it used to be. Yes we could still gather a big fleet
    relatively easily, but others picked up on the seeds of boredom and wanted to
    do something new. Meetings happened quickly and fast. Although, many people were
    fed up with \u201Cpolitics\u201D and just wanted to have fun. The corporations
    in the great wild lands created there own new alliance, the Russian speaking corporations
    created RED alliance, Shinra do there own thing, VOTF, Mercenary Frigates, Supremacy
    and other fighting corporations flattened NORAD in a few weeks, even with NORAD
    getting support from \u201Cfriends\u201D it was a walk in the park.   \n  \nThis
    was although patchy my journey though CA. To not leave you high and dry here is
    some views and info in no particular order:   \n  \nXirtam (also known as the
    Dark Lord): A good diplomat for a fighter (put as diplomatically as I can). He
    helped make CA a true democracy, in hind sight that was possibly a mistake. However
    you will be hard push to find anyone who can gather another 30 battleships in
    a matter of minutes and bring them to the frontline battles. A fun fight was at
    the jump-in to DSS, Duke (OC) said \u201Cwe will get slaughtered\u201D, Xirtam
    said \u201Cxxxx xxxx lets jump\u201D and we absolutely owned that gate after a
    good battle.   \n  \nFoyle: As the holder of \u201CCA alliance\u201D, the alliance
    fund plus all the remaining minerals from the stations she is not short of a few
    isk. Interestingly GW did not want her in their group, properly the biggest gathering
    staying in the former CA. Did she become the CA scapegoat despite all she did
    for CA? I do think the move to become a \u201CWar General\u201D without having
    fired a shot so to speak, didn\u2019t do her any favors and her dreams of doing
    diplomacy with the strength of CA military was too ambitious and self serving.
    What she is going to do with the funds that she was trusted to hold I\u2019m not
    sure she even know. Many have asked, but the silence is deafening.   \n  \nDid
    we fight? Ohh yes\u2026 and we won far more on a whole than we ever lost.   \n
    \ \nIn closing, CA was great for me, I would happily do it all again. I have been
    in so many great battles, had the trust and honor to now and then lead enormous
    fleets, gained so many friends and really lived life to the full. A final \u201Cthank
    you\u201D goes to all the Curse Alliance people who made me boldly go where others
    feared and gave me a memorable experience.   \n  \nGunship Ex-CA War General"
