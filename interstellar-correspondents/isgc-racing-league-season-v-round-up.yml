    the special prize of **Rookie of the Year** went to:  \n**_Rawr Cristina_**\n\nThe
    season began on 30th March with the first race taking place in the Essence region.
    Three capsuleers lost ships during this opening race of the season and it was
    won by none other than the Interceptor Champion, Takashi Kurosawa.\n\nOver the
    course of the season the racers went through Heimatar, Molden Heath, Everyshore,
    Tash-Murkon, Sinq Laison, Derelik, Genesis, Providence, Kor-Azor, The Bleak Lands
    and finally The Citadel.\n\nThe Citadel was the region that saw the destruction
    of 21 of the racers ships, the loss of a pod and millions of ISK worth of equipment.
    This was the most destructive and bloody race in the leagues history; it was also
    the first time that the organiser of the races Gyra Rho was not able to be present
    to officiate. In her absence a guest official, **Horatio Cain** , stood in for
    her, and under the circumstances it was agreed by all that he did an outstanding
    job.\n\nSeason VI is still in the planning stage but has the potential to be one
    of the most exciting seasons ever. It is currently due to start on Sunday 24th
    August.\n\nFor more information on the league or to sign up for Season VI please
