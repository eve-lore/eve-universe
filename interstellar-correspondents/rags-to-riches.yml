- body: "**JITA** \\- There is a persistent rumor circulating amongst the traders
    of the galaxy that a savvy trader could move to a market hub and make unbelievable
    sums of money from nearly nothing, in as little as one month. One enterprising
    capsuleer has set out to test this theory. \n\nFresh capsuleer graduate Bouncer
    Ricdic has taken his 5,000 ISK graduation gift from the School of Applied Knowledge,
    and challenged himself to turn it into 1 billion ISK in the space of one month.
    The reporters of the Interstellar Correspondents have gone out to seek an interview
    with this extraordinary individual, and we have returned with a profile of this
    careful daily trader. \n\nRicdic says that he can complete most of his trading
    in one to three hour segments each day. He doesn't rely on having huge amounts
    of time, or always staring at the market for rare deals. When asked what his favorite
    trading commodities were, he says he doesn't want to give too much information
    away to the public. \"The key however is to diversify,\" says Ricdic, \"I buy
    anything that I can resell at a decent markup.\" He finds his self-imposed limitation
    of staying within the Jita system challenging, but not too difficult, and it does
    have its benefits. \n\n\"[The turnover rate] is actually incredibly fast on some
    items.\" Ricdic uses turnover to ensure he can keep his money from being stuck
    in long term sales. How long is too long to have your money tied up? Ricdic has
    this advice: \"Due to the large amounts of competition in Jita, generally if your
    goods haven\u2019t sold within about three to four hours they will need their
    price modified... But being in Jita you usually have a good chance of selling
    most of your stocks within one to two hours.\" \n\nAccording to Ricdic, his biggest
    challenge to date has been maintaining his impressive cash flow as the amount
    of credits he invests increases. He advises that as your wallet amount grows,
    it becomes less a question of overall profit margin, and more a question of value
    per unit. \"Turning a 40 thousand per item profit now is quite sufficient but
    when dealing with 500m of capital you will need a lot more orders on hand to continue
    increasing your ISK...\" Ricdic says this focus on margin per unit keeps him positive
    in the face of the massive size of the market. \"Having to update 500 buy orders
    [every] three to six hours would be enough to make anyone\u2019s hair fall out.\"
    \n\nWe asked Ricdic what effect he thinks this, his latest project, will have
    on the popularity of the Eve Bank, which he manages as a member of the board of
    directors. \"EBANK already had 650 clients before this project begun. I haven\u2019t
    directly linked the two as I had no real reason to think it worthwhile. EBANK
    itself is becoming a name people know. Market awareness is the hardest part of
    a project such as EBANK and we have found simple word of mouth by clients and
    their friends sufficient to do this.\" \n\nWe also asked about what improvements
    Ricdic might make to the market if it was his to control. He mostly felt that
    transaction fees and taxes were too high, and he found the standard capsule integrated
    market interface a little clumsy. He also found that the auto-refresh feature
    which downloads new market transaction data after a trade sometimes caused the
    interface to stop responding, and the fact that it doesn't distinguish clearly
    between corporate orders and personal ones was something he would like to see
    addressed. \n\nThe Interstellar Correspondents would like to thank Bouncer Ricdic
    for taking the time to respond to our questions, and wish him the best of luck
    in his ventures."
