    TRIBUTE** \\- A large Morsus Mihi [RAWR] mining operation consisting of at least
    seventy-one vessels fell victim to The Initiative [INIT.] shortly after 16:00
    yesterday.  \n  \nActing on intelligence received from within RAWR, The Initiative
    opened a covert portal into the cyno jammed PNDN-V utilizing a Panther-class black
    operations vessel. The portal was transited by approximately twelve stealth bombers
    who proceeded to warp into a strike position before releasing their payload of
    mostly thermal bombs. Sensor logs indicate the vast majority of the RAWR mining
    ships withstood only two detonations.  \n  \nThe final tally stands at fifty-five
    exhumers, eleven barges, and five industrials.  \n  \nIn response to questions
    regarding the surprise attack, Vuk Lau of RAWR reported \"We were trying to get
    rid of the excess and useless ships. Our old friends The Initiative helped us
    with that.\"  \n  \nScout Black of The Initiative noted that all the credit for
    the successful operation belonged to Sister Bliss, fleet commander of The Initiative
    forces.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[The Initiative Battle Log](http://killboard.the-initiative.com/?a=kill_related&kll_id=24713)\n\n*
