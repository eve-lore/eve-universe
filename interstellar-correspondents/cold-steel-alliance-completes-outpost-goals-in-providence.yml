    Providence** \\- Cold STEEL Alliance [STEEL] have announced the completion of
    their two newest outposts which they hope will provide better combat and infrastructure
    support for them in the Providence region.  \n  \n[STEEL]'s CEO, evilPHish, revealed
    why the two newest outposts, Magrathea and Patria Aquilla (in N-RMSH and DNR-7M,
    respectively) would help the region: \"It is easier for allies, friends and guests
    alike to store things, take cover or conduct market activities.\"  \n  \nTo support
    the building of the outposts, [STEEL] shut down the constellation and called in
    a watchful guard of over 100 battle-ready ships, and more than 20 capital-class
    ships, including a Nyx-class mothership, to protect the massive construction sites,
    along with the stores of materials needed to finish the projects quickly.  \n
    \ \nAn outspoken opponent of [STEEL], Karn Mithralia, commented that \"Two more
    outposts are just a drop in the ocean among the on-going pro-Amarrian colonization
    efforts in Providence.\" The leader of Ushra'Khan continued, \"It changes nothing
    for us, we come for our people.\"  \n  \nNow that the P6N8-J constellation has
    an outpost in each system, [STEEL] has set their sights on securing the region,
    and making it safer for friendly and neutral targets alike. As for the immediate
    future of [STEEL] in Providence, evilPHish finished by stating: \"We will stay,
    we will fight and we will prevail. Amarr victory!\"\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected
