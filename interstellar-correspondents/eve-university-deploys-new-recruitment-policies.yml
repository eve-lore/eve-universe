    Metropolis** \\- Eve University [E-UNI] has put into place a new recruitment system
    \ \u200Bwhich they hope will allow them to process applications in a much more
    timely fashion.  \n  \nE-UNI has received more applications per week than they
    ever have in recent months, with waiting times for applicants rising from \"3-5
    days to 4 weeks and over\" for the month of December alone.  \n  \nDarian Reymont,
    Director of Personnel for E-UNI, admitted that the \"old system simply wasn't
    designed to cope with current demand\", and said they were forced to \"adapt or
    risk damaging the University's reputation beyond repair.\"  \n  \nThe new system
    now sees applicants no longer having to endure an interview with a \"recruitment
    officer\" that could last up to 40 minutes. With applications now based more on
    a new questionnaire system, it has caused some concern on whether E-UNI is more
    subject to dangerous capsuleers entering their ranks. Azmodeus Valar, Director
    within E-UNI, admitted that it has the potential to be \"more dangerous\" but
    also stated that they \"have also greatly strengthened security checks for access
    once someone is in the University\", however she declined to go into detail about
    what these new security checks were, except to say they \"have many people in
    the corp who are looking for infiltrators.\"  \n  \nAlong with these changes to
    recruitment, there will also be \"video introduction\" and \"application guides\"
    made available in the near future to help rookie capsuleers make their way in
    New Eden.  \n  \nDespite the changes to the recruitment system, Darian maintains
    that E-UNI is still easily accessible to every capsuleer, claiming that \"joining
    the University has never been easier then it is right now.\"  \n  \n **[editor's
    note: please be advised that Eve University is a wholly capsuleer run organization
    and any participation is at your own risk.]**\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Information
