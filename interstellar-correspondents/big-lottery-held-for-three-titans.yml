    Eden** \\- BIG has announced that they will be raffling off three Titans in what
    appears to be one of the highest payouts for a lottery that New Eden has ever
    seen. Being more than just a catchy name, The BIG 'Triple-Titan' Lottery will
    be giving away an Avatar class and two Erebus class titans fully fit for travel.
    \ \n  \nLess than one month ago, Otherworld Enterprises CEO, Chribba, held a similar
    lottery for a single Erebus class titan. Eclipsing that lottery by a fairly comfortable
    margin, this event should once again place BIG firmly atop the list of entities
    who regularly hold such notable lotteries. Capsuleers all around New Eden have
    taken notice of this event and are quickly grabbing up tickets.  \n  \nThe cost
    per ticket is 10 million isk, with no limit to the number of tickets purchased
    by an individual. In addition, each ticket will be valid for each draw, so it
    is possible for the same ticket to win all three titans. Chances to enter the
    lottery will end when 30,000 tickets have been sold. For details on how to enter
    the drawing, follow BIG's GalNet reference link.\n\n### GalNet References:\n\n[BIG
