- body: "A State Protectorate fleet was annihilated early this week by a Federal Defence
    force led by Mitch Taylor. Reports indicate a 10:1 kill ratio with 42 ships destroyed
    (including a dozen pods) and only 4 losses.  \n\nSeizing on an opportunity to
    destroy a control tower coming out of reinforced mode in Notoras, Mitch Taylor
    assembled a fleet of approximately 65 pilots. Although the corporation that deployed
    the starbase is not formally a member of the State Protectorate, the destruction
    of it was enough to raise a State fleet in Nourvukaiken.\n\nAfter almost 30 minutes
    of trying to draw the State fleet into Tama at the Nourvukaiken stargate, early
    warning pickets reported that the State fleet was attempting to flank the Federals
    by coming through Usi . Taylor successfully forced a Caldari scout to break contact
    with his fleet, and quickly made for the Ishomilken star system undetected.\n\nWith
    no warning of what was waiting for them, the State fleet arriving in Ishomilken
    was ambushed and crushed without mercy; over a dozen enemy corpses were left floating
    in space."
