- body: "The first official press release from the newly formed Eidolon Milita calls
    on fellow Gallentean citizens as well as others interested to join their cause
    and to defend the ideals on which the Federation was built on.   \n  \nFollowing
    the loss of the Gallentean Titan Molyneux to the Serpentis and the inability of
    both politicians and the Federation Navy to prevent it from happening, Eidolon
    Militia, calls on capsuleers to defend \"our freedom, our safety, and the ideals
    we hold dear, not some distant, faceless government\".   \n  \nClaiming that the
    days of the standing navy are over, Eidolon Militia aspires to become a civilian
    defensive force capable of protecting Federation territory by efforts in science,
    industry and combat.   \n  \nWe have managed to get in touch with Eidolon Militia's
    CEO and Founder, Mr. Richard Steele for a few questions.   \n  \nCould you tell
    me what led to the creation of Eidolon Militia?   \n  \n\"Well, I had just pulled
    my barge into dock at a refinery in the Stacmon system. I looked up at the news
    monitor in the hangar and there was the report of the theft of our Titan. Over
    the next few hours I saw the reports of the battles to retake the vessel and all
    I could think was \"I wish I could join them\". I kept waiting for a report about
    the Navy or CONCORD or a capsuleer group retaking the ship and of course it never
    came... \"   \n  \n\u201CI felt powerless, and I started to wonder if there was
    anyone in our entire Federation willing to go out there and do something about
    it. Everyone I saw and talked to about it seemed to feel the same way about it
    as I did. The general consensus was 'what can *I* do about it?'\"   \n  \n\"Civilians
    have the means to take action and stand up for themselves. All they need to do
    is to join together into a single unified force. We created the Eidolon Militia
    to be that force - civilians working together to insure the security of Federation
    space.\"   \n  \nAfter the creation of the Eidolon Militia, how many capsuleers
    have joined your cause so far?   \n  \n\"We currently have several applicants
    we are reviewing right now. One has gone on to become a recruit and several more
    will follow in the next few days.\"   \n  \nWhere would you like to see Eidolon
    Militia in the future?   \n  \n\"Three places: In every system in the Federation
    that CONCORD infrequently patrols, if at all. As witnesses at Salvador Sarpati's
    trial. And in the hearts and minds of Federation citizens everywhere as example
    of the price of freedom: Eternal vigilance.\"   \n  \nSome political analysts
    are saying that this development could have a small effect on the election, taking
    support away from President Foiritan as they continue to slate his effectiveness
    in defending the federation. It is too early to say how much of an effect they
    might have though.   \n  \nYou can read the press release [here](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=183600)"
