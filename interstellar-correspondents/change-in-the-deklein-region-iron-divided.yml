    the Deklein region to regroup in Empire space.  \nThe [statement](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=319657)
    has been relayed by Darko1107, Co-CEO of EXODUS, Executor of the IRON alliance.
    In it, he explains the motivations and reasons behind the move, namely communication
    problems within the alliance, and disagreements concerning the Republic\u2019s
    future as well as logistics problems in holding sovereignty in the region. \n\nAs
    such, senior corporations EXODUS, Synergy. and InterGalactic Corp. have effectively
    terminated membership of the other corporations from the Republic. Citing indiscipline,
    low morale and an averted coup-d\u2019\xE9tat, they have, \u201Cmoved out of Deklein,
    and left whatever entities existing there to form their own alliance and take
    the stations.\u201D  \nIt will not, however, be flying free of all ties, as positive
    standings will be kept with former allies such as corporations from the G Alliance,
    RAZOR Alliance as well as other residents of the Fade and Deklein regions.  \nWhen
    asked about their next step, Mr. Darko explained that they will be regrouping
    and reorganizing both on the corporation and alliance level, to then \u201Cpick
    a target, or targets, and attack them for as long as deemed fit.\u201D \n\nFor
    former IRON corporations, such as The Arrow Project or AUS Corporation, the move
    was surprising, but not unexpected, since discontent had been brooding in alliance
    ranks for a while.  \nTheir first priority is now to consolidate the territorial
    claim and station control, as well as \u201Cmake sure that everyone that remains
    is taken care of,\u201D as explained by 1naz, Executive Officer at ARROW. They
    are not alone in this task, since support has been flowing from neighbours as
    well as former alliance members; sources indicate that pilots have been returning
    to the region due to the new direction the political landscape has taken. \n\nIt
    has now to be seen whether their next step will be the formation of an alliance
    to regroup Deklein resident corporations, or if some of the more influential corporations
    will be absorbed by the newly formed Dusk and Dawn alliance.  \nWhatever the course
    of action, political relations will not be changing much, since the entity will
    be staying in the north-western power block. \n\nCommenting on the scission, Kep
    Ekatemi, political analyst from the University of Caille, thinks that \u201CIt
    was for the best interests of both seceding parties, effectively avoiding a civil
    war, which could have had disastrous consequences on their respective interests
    and goals.\u201D  \nAccording to him, this alternative is supplanting armed conflict
    in the resolution of leadership differences, as seen in the recent splintering
    of the Axiom Empire from the Ascendant Frontier."
