- body: "Gashtik Anfeld, an Amarrian trader who was about to dock at the CONCORD Bureau
    when the fleet arrived in system was still in a state of shock several hours after
    the event. His reaction has been a common one amongst the pilots and station inhabitants
    in the Yulai system.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ve never seen, or felt anything like it.
    I was just there, about to dock. I had brought a cargo full of Silicates from
    Tash-Murkon, and was daydreaming, looking forward to meeting my friend, Yako Pertogi,
    and sharing a cup of tea after the long flight. I was waiting in the queue for
    docking acceptance, and then it happened.\n\n\u201CFirst of all, I thought I was
    under attack. The light, the sound; it was like nothing you\u2019ve ever heard.
    I tried to shield my eyes, but I could see through my hands. I could actually
    see the bones in my hands. I thought it really was the end, then just as I started
    making my prayers, the shockwave hit my ship. The shockwave hit my ship and everything
    started to go crazy. My control console shook, my alarm panel lit up, and in my
    headset all my audible alarms went off at once.\n\n\u201CSo there I am, seeing
    the bones in my hands, hearing my Bestower tear herself apart, feeling the ship
    moving sideways at over five hundred metres per second. Finally, though it seemed
    like an eternity had passed yet it couldn\u2019t have been more than a few seconds,
    my camera drones came back online. The light had been so intense, so magnificent,
    it had caused them to close down completely; I guess they have some automatic
    function to prevent damage at high light levels. I\u2019m not sure. Anyway, so
    my camera drones came back online, and I looked at the screen.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m
    seeing all these swirls, these beautiful purple-pink swirls, blue swirls, hey,
    you know, like a vortex, and there\u2019s like lightning, though it\u2019s no
    lightning you would ever see on a planet, or yeh, nothing I have ever seen before.
    I\u2019ve flown Bestowers for seventy years, and I thought I had seen it all.
    I\u2019ve seen the static discharge from an Armageddon that\u2019s just docked
    kill a man, and yeh, that was pretty intense, but this lightning, it was like
    the vengeance of God himself.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m sat there thinking, well, I\u2019m
    not really thinking anything at this stage; I\u2019m just in awe of this, I\u2019m
    sort of torn between thinking is this heaven? Is this hell? Like, I\u2019m just
    in sensory overload and just as I am making sense of it all, or sort of gathering
    my senses to start my brain thinking, then they appear. They just appear.\n\n\u201CFrom
    nowhere. No, not nowhere. Out of the middle, aye, the centre, the whatever. Out
    of the eye of the storm, these ships appear. I\u2019m not stupid, like I said,
    I\u2019ve flown Bestowers for seventy years, and a Bestower is a pretty big ship.
    These ships that appear, they\u2019re obscene. They\u2019re just so big, it\u2019s
    like well. Well, remember when you were young, when you saw your first Impairor?
    You thought that was big right. Then you see a bit of the universe, and yeh, you
    kind of get used to seeing Apocalypses and Armageddons. They\u2019re big. Nothing,
    and I mean nothing, was as big as these things that just kind of appeared from
    this vortex. The guns. Heh, the guns. They were as big an Impairor. I mean it.
    I know you don\u2019t believe me; these guns were as big as an Impairor. They\u2019re
    as big as an Impairor, and they\u2019re pointing at me. That\u2019s right; well,
    not really, they\u2019re pointing at the station, but, like, I\u2019m in between
    these frigate sized guns and the station.\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s not a nice position
    to be in. These behemoths, they\u2019ve appeared out of nowhere, just appeared
    in a flash of purple and pink and blue lightning, and now I\u2019m sat between
    them and their target. Just me and my cargo of Silicates. I\u2019m desperately
    trying to dock, but, well, the station seems to have shut down. It\u2019s not
    letting anyone in, or out. Well, what could I do? Not a lot my friend. These ships
    are so big I dare not move. I\u2019m not going to try and warp to a gate; I don\u2019t
    want to appear hostile. So I sit there a while, and I\u2019m thinking \u2018well,
    let me get a close look. If they\u2019re going to kill you, at least know what
    killed you\u2019\n\n\u201CI counted fifteen of them in total. Fifteen of these
    massive ships. They were obviously Minmatar in origin; I recognised the Republic
    Fleet insignia on some of them. The insignia on the others, I\u2019ve been told,
    was the Thukker Tribe. Who knows? Who cares? These ships were like four kilometres
    high. There could have been God himself flying them, I would still be worried.\n\n\u201CBut,
    right, yeh, here is the scary piece. Yeh, that was just the beginning. As I am
    sat there watching these fifteen massive ships start to move; starting to move
    into positions around the station, then through the vortex dozens, that\u2019s
    right, dozens of Minmatar support ships appear. Tempests, Maelstroms, Typhoons,
    Ruptures, Sabres, Claymores; they had the full show on display. These boys meant
    business. When they arrived they took up covering positions around these massive
    ships, taunting the CONCORD ships to take them on.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m on the edge
    of my seat here. I have a front row seat for the biggest firework show in history,
    and if I am going to die watching it, well, so be it. I finished my prayers, lit
    up a smoke and sat back to watch.\n\n\u201CThey sat there for about fifteen minutes.
    I sat there watching them. They sat there watching CONCORD. Nobody moved; or should
    I say, nobody dared to move. Then, suddenly, as if a silent order had been issued,
    the Minmatar ships disappeared. Well, not disappeared, but they left the way they
    came; a powerful lightning storm, all purple, blue and pink, a massive shockwave,
    and they all went. Just in the blink of an eye.\n\n\u201CI sat there for a while,
    wondering what the hell I had just seen. I looked around, the CONCORD ships were
    still on station, buzzing about like there was no tomorrow. I sat there, motionless,
    in my Bestower. Eventually, a Tug came out and towed me into the docking bay.\u201D"
