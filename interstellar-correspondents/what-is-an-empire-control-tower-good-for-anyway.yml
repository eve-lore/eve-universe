    of Starbase Charters that are available to capsuleers, and this begs the question;
    what exactly is the use for an empire based control tower and its associated assemblies?
    \n\nAn empire control tower can only be erected within a star system with a mid-level
    CONCORD rating. To even consider deployment of a tower, the prospective corporate
    entity must be held in high regard by the local political and / or controlling
    corporate body. No lucrative activity such as moon mining or refining is permitted,
    so why are capsuleers erecting them? \n\nTwo large alliances, solely devoted to
    research and development, have made great use of this opportunity. These two alliances
    are direct competitors, but maintain a friendly rivalry. \n\nInterviews were conducted
    with Mr. Ricdic, CEO of Corporate Research & Production (C-R-A) and executor of
    the Zzz alliance, and also with Mr. Alvara, founder of Kuiper Belt Industries,
    executor of the Empire Research Alliance, and his right hand man within the alliance,
    Mr. Jesters Knight of Encoded Theory corporation. \n\nThe limited number of publicly
    available research slots is hurting the research and development of blueprints
    and inventions. Verbal and physical assaults are commonplace on the queues at
    many public research facilities. Empire Research, and C-R-A both saw a need to
    ease this issue and both determined that the best way to do so was to deploy control
    towers, attach mobile research labs to them, and invite others to use their facilities
    at a minimal cost. \n\nUnfortunately, technological issues have limited the usefulness
    of mobile research laboratories. As a member of the alliance, member corporations
    can use any research centre owned by a fellow alliance corporation to conduct
    research on the properties of blueprints. However, security features built into
    the laboratory central computer system only allow blueprints to be copied if the
    researcher is a member of the corporation that owns the facility. This limitation
    also extends to enterprising researchers attempting to modify blueprints in order
    to create the next new ship or module for the capsuleer community. Regardless,
    both organizations have forged on and provide the best that they can for their
    customers. \n\nBoth alliances rely on their member corporations as customers.
    By sharing resources, customers benefit from vastly reduced queue times, jobs
    that take three quarters of the time to complete than in traditional station laboratories,
    and lower research costs. The owner corporations are able to pull in extra isk
    from fees on research slots that would normally lay dormant if not in full use
    by corporation members. While the goals of both alliances are similar, the origins
    of each couldn\u2019t be more different. \n\n_Zzz Alliance_  \nC-R-A was founded
    by an initial investment of ten billion ISK, with one million shares spread among
    slightly more than 100 investors. In the first thirteen months of operation, C-R-A
    has grown to an 18.5 billion ISK corporation, and dividends have effectively repaid
    back almost sixty-eight percent of initial investment to date. Assets of the alliance
    as a whole include ten large control towers (seven owned by C-R-A directly, three
    by member corporations that pay a monthly operating fee) and more than 130 mobile
    research laboratories. \n\n\u201CResearch profits aren\u2019t superb. I think
    [the] customer base is the key here. I believe the customer base of Zzz alone
    would be worth a good five to ten billion ISK\" comments Ricdic. \n\nZzz alliance
    has grown via aggressive advertising and reasonable fees. Without their hard won
    customer base, Zzz could have been just another failed research alliance. \n\nLooking
    to the future, Riddic said: \u201CThe most crucial change that would benefit both
    me, and all research services\u2026 is the ability to offer researching services
    to the public. [This] reduces alliance fees considerably, doesn't need anywhere
    near the same level of advertising, resolves the current issue of public overcrowded
    labs, and provides a new level of competition within the public sector. I feel
    this is a crucial step that should be taken to remove some of the reliance on
    government run facilities, and put it into the hands of the public.\u201D \n\nThis
    seems to be a common lament among the researchers at large. \n\n_Empire Research
    Alliance_  \nEmpire Research was founded by Alvara. Unlike Zzz, Empire Research
    was created not as a corporate behemoth, but as a social commune. \n\nJesters
    Knight informed us that: \"Empire Research was originally formed to allow friends
    to access unused research spaces at our facilities. We then began adding in more
    tower owners and research corporations. However due to complications in the mobile
    research laboratory security, blueprint copying was disabled for everyone except
    the owning corporation. After that we saw a decrease in membership numbers and
    usage. Recently, we have been slowly climbing up towards... higher numbers. We
    would like to allow members to use the labs fully, including the copy functions,
    but the technology simply isn\u2019t there yet\u201D \n\nWhile Empire Research
    does have final say on location of tower deployments, and collects a fee for doing
    so, Empire Research does not itself own any towers. The onus of maintaining the
    research centre falls squarely on the corporation that built it. Income is derived
    for the corporation from the fees imposed per slot and time. \n\nCurrently, Empire
    Research has eight deployed towers, run by eight different corporations, in what
    can best be described as a loose confederation of entities working together for
    the social good. Alvara declares at the closing of the interview that \u201CWe
    are more than just an alliance that provides a service. We are a community of
    friends who help each other.\u201D \n\n_External GalNet References_   \n[C-R-A
