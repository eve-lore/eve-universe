    \ \n  \nHeld by the 'Ships of Eve' lottery to promote ticket sales, the event
    was described by T'Amber as being a success. She said: \"Although a lot less people
    than I thought would turn up, it was enjoyable. There was drama and ganking and
    people made it through and had fun.\"  \n  \nMister Tregiew and mystiq pwnzorg,
    both flying Ares class vessels, completed the route in 23 minutes and were both
    awarded the first prize as the race was too close to call. They each won a set
    of +5 implants, 20 tech2 frigates of their choice and 20 free tickets to the lottery.
    \ \n  \nThe third spot was occupied by Ikthyace Notbright, flying a Vigil. He
    completed the route in 27 minutes and won a set of +4 implants, 10 tech2 frigates
    of his choice and 20 free tickets to the lottery.  \n  \nCapsuleers flew through
    five checkpoints systems, encountering pirate gank fleets and with some pilots
    experiencing navigational issues. While checkpoints could be traversed in any
    order, most racers decided to take the shortest route: a 29 jumps course, of which
    18 were through low security systems.[![The ami gate camped by scum](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3263/amicampedthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3263/amicamped.png)\n\nUpon
    entry to the Ami system, racers found - to their dismay- the gate camped by SCUM.
    alliance. Some racers only lost their ships, while others (including T'Amber)
    lost their pods as well.  \n  \nLars Zundi of SCUM. explained that they were not
    expecting the race to pass through Ami: \"It was a case of right time, right place.
    We only realised that the 'ships of eve' was passing through Ami when lots of
    small ships started appearing.\"  \n  \nReferring to the lottery and T'Amber's
    efforts to promote it, Lars said \"it is a great and noble undertaking. Especially
    when it comes through our gatecamp. The reward is all the sweeter if risk is involved.
    We supply the risk!\"  \n  \nAccording to T'Amber, all participants received tickets
    as a prize in various amounts. However, to easily manage bigger numbers, she added
    that rules might be revised in future races.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the
