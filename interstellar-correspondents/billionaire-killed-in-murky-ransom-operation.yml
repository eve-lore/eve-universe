- body: "TAISY. Newcomer to the capsuleer community and billionaire Sid Cops was recently
    ransomed and killed by rogue corporation Total Ransom.  \nWhat sets this incident
    apart is the sum paid by the victim, which totalled 2000 million ISK. \n\nIt would
    seem Mr. Cops was visiting relatives in Caldari space, when he was caught in his
    Deimos by the pirates, who first ransomed him, and once paid, swiftly destroyed
    the ship and the capsule. Help did arrive, but too late to prevent the payoff
    and ensuing destruction. \n\nWhen confronted about breaking the pirate\u2019s
    code of honour, the CEO of Total Ransom, John Dips argued that \u201CHe was actually
    working under contract,\u201D and not pirating \u201Cin the strictest sense of
    the term.\u201D Rival outlaw corporations were quick to condemn this perjury,
    speaking of \u201Cunethical practices, even for pirates,\u201D and \u201Cbad business
    practices.\u201D \n\nSid Cops, who is now recovering from the loss of his original
    body and the subsequent clone-activation qualified the act as \u201Cbarbaric and
    immoral, even by the depraved standards of the Caldari State.\u201D When asked
    about the sum paid, Mr. Cops said that \u201Cit was his first, natural body,\u201D
    and that it was \u201Cwrong for anyone to be forced to be separated from their
    body.\u201D He then deplored the fact that \u201Che couldn\u2019t even recover
    his birthright and unique gift from nature.\u201D\n\nHowever, when told about
    a possible contract on him, Mr. Cops preferred to remain silent, and asked for
    the reporters to leave when rumours concerning his wealth were brought up. \n\nCONCORD
    has indicated that it has opened an investigation on Sid Cops and that it will
    be collaborating with the local Police on the incident in Taisy."
