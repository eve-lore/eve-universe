    enterprising promoters are still trying to sell the glamor and excitement of the
    matched combat experience. Mini-tournaments and group combat operation opportunities
    are popping up everywhere in New Eden. \n\nParticipation in the Alliance Tournament
    is often thought of as a dream by many pod pilots who lack the means to take part
    in it themselves. Malicious Blender felt that young pilots in less established
    corporations should also be able to experience the excitement of a combat tournament
    usually geared to well off alliances. \n\nHeld only a few days ago, the unnamed
    tournament run by Blender was loosely based on the rules used in the Alliance
    Tournament, with a stronger emphasis on the skill of pilots rather than the ability
    to purchase exotic ships and high end equipment. To that end, the rules included
    stronger restrictions on both the ships and modules allowed. Here are the rules
    in greater detail: \n\n  * High security arena\n  * An impartial judge who holds
    the isk, and gets 10% of the pot\n  * 5M Entry, full 16 bracket means 56M first
    prize, 16M second\n  * No faction, deadspace, or COSMOS modules\n  * No ECM or
    medium drones\n  * Only rookie frigates, with a maximum of one active drone at
    a time\n  * 50km radius arena with the Judge at the centre\n  * Varying warp in
    ranges, min 10km max 50km\n\nThe pilots competed in a series of one-on-one elimination
    rounds located in a designated arena in the Eiluvodi system. The combatants entered
    the arena at desired ranges and commenced the fight at the agreed upon signal.
    \n\nMalicious Blender informed us that \u201CWe had a couple of minor problems,
    such as a no-show judge, but we improvised.\u201D He went further to say: \u201CI
    honestly didn't do as well as I expected to, but it was tons of fun, and the competition
    was very exciting.\u201D \n\nAfter completing some intense rounds of combat Jennifur
    Foxkitty, whose entry was backed by Zhecao Vai, took away the 17.5 million isk
    prize on only her 1st day in space. The success of this event has now left Blender
    thinking about running similar competitions in the future: \u201CThe next one
    I'll be running will be another one-on-one tournament, this time limited to Tech
    1, Tier 1 frigates. I'm hoping for around sixteen participants.\u201D \n\nWhen
    discussing the possibility of future tournaments, one of the pilots who competed
    commented: \u201CI think it would be a great thing to happen more often. One of
    the pilots, Blarghus, had never done any combat of this sort before. He ended
    up getting second place against some more seasoned players.\u201D \n\nThere are
    other events throughout New Eden that are offering new pilots the chance for some
    excitement. One such example is the upcoming \u201CChicken Run\u201D, which its
    organizer Razmite X is hoping will draw a large numbers of rookie pilots. The
    event, scheduled for some time during May (depending on level of interest and
    committed pilots), intends to be host to more than 100 ships that will burst into
    low security space en masse and overpower more battle hardened pilots who they
    come across. Sign up now to get in on the fun! Follow the link below. \n\n[More
