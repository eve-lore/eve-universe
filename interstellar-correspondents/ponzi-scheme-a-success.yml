    The Forge** \\- On 12.8.113 the investment corporation, Phaser Inc. [-PINC] shut
    down their business, closed all 3360 active accounts and took an alleged 1 Trillion
    ISK profit.   \n  \n-PINC, run by Eddie Lampert and Mordor Exuel, started business
    8 months ago. Investors got promised a minimum interest of 5% per week which was
    either paid out or reinvested, a continuous reinvestment was meant to lead to
    a 1437% profit in one year. Initial skeptical opinions turned out to be right
    as Mordor Exuel has now revealed that \"It was a 100% pure meant to be Ponzi scheme,
    right from the start.\"   \n  \nThe way it worked was thus; the money invested
    was used to pay the promised interests in an attempt to gain reputation and to
    lure in more investors and money. -PINC succeeded with that according to Mordor
    Exuel after automating the investment process: \"It started to fly. People just
    threw billions at us without any form or personal contact.\"   \n  \nNear the
    end -PINC began heavy advertisement to cash in as much money as possible. According
    to their numbers, they collected in total 1.8 Trillion ISK, paid 500 billion in
    interests and withdrawals and kept 1 Trillion ISK as profit. Mordor said that
    they wanted to \"earn big...without worries about ISK ever again\" and went on
    to say that now \"With 500 billion for each\" they should be able to do just that.
    \  \n  \nDelicious Monster, one of the affected investors.told how he invested
    until he had around 2 Billion ISK in their books, which he has lost, and admits
    that their scheme was crafty. He went on to say how he expects karma to \"come
    back and screw them\", but that he has also learned that \"you can't trust anyone
    in New Eden\".   \n  \nThere seems to be some capsuleers however, that are skeptical
    about the numbers. One of those that has doubts is Lauren Hellfury, she considers
    the alleged profit to be unlikely high. Without proof she believes that \"we are
    still awaiting the first pure 1 Trillion ISK scam\" and that \"such a significant
    event \"requires a demonstration of success, not merely a claim.\"   \n  \nPhaser
    Inc. is now closed and Mordor Exuel and Eddie Lampert believe that it has been
    a journey and consider their scheme a sucess: \"We fulfilled over 800 withdrawal
    requests. We answered over 6,000 mails and processed more than 15,000 payouts.
    It's been an incredible event. And, isn't that beautiful after all? This can only
    be done in New Eden.\"\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Phaser Inc. has Capusleers
