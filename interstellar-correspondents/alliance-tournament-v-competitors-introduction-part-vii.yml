- body: "The **Fifth Alliance Tournament** is almost upon us. This year\u2019s entrants
    include a number of new, smaller and mostly unknown alliances as well as the established
    tournament veterans. \n\nNext in our series of alliance introductions, we present
    _**DeStInY.**_\n\n**DeStInY. (DSTNY)**\n\n* * *\n\nElevated heart rate. A fluttering,
    unsettled feeling in the stomach. Sweating. Shortness of breath and a tendency
    to suddenly shout loudly or possibly cry quietly on the shoulders of nearby friends
    or family. These will be the symptoms of being in DeStInY. alliance at 19:00 on
    Friday the 29th. \n\nYes, this is when the flag drops for their first match against
    The Five. Their tournament group, Group F, is quite possibly one of the toughest
    in the competition. IGS pundits such as Tyrrax Thorrk and QuaarJet are united
    in rating the strongest contenders in this nightmarish group as The Five and Atlas
    Alliance, but Ev0ke and Divine 0rder will be no pushovers either. \n\n5n4keyes,
    the Executor of DeStInY. offered the following insights into his alliance and
    why they banded together: \n\n\u201COur only goals are to have fun, and always
    find new things to do... The alliance was created for several reasons, firstly
    because it was something we had never done before, and secondly, because at the
    time of creation, there was a limit on the number of people you could set standings
    to, so an alliance was an easier way to manage it.\u201D \n\nIt might seem from
    the white knuckles and gritted jaws that a number of teams in the tournament will
    be having anything but fun, but DeStInY. are by no means walking into their matches
    blindly. 5n4keyes has a few cards up his sleeve. \n\nDeStInY. are no strangers
    to combat; they claim the northern part of Deklein \u2013 a hotly contested region
    \u2013 where they fight it out on a day to day basis with fellow contenders Ev0ke
    and such groups as Rare Faction and Phoenix Allianz. \n\nAnother factor in their
    favor is previous tournament experience \u2013 DeStInY. fielded a team in the
    Third Alliance Tournament, and watched the Fourth, on which this one is most closely
    modeled, with an eye for potential advantages. \n\n\u201CI think previous tournaments
    have shown us research is pointless, because the first fights have some whacky
    setups, and fights after that can [involve] the most random things ever! For example,
    ten Thoraxes!\u201D \n\nIt seems DeStInY. have come a long way since their Third
    Tournament entry. They\u2019ve dug into their space and gelled together as a fighting
    force. 5n4keyes explained: \n\n\u201CWe decided to join the Fifth Alliance Tournament
    as we are a little more settled, and have enjoyed the tournament in the past.
    \n\n\u201C[This year], the whole alliance is the team. The team is very open for
    any member to take part, rather than say 15 [most skilled pilots] in the alliance.\u201D
    \n\nAs for the teams he is most wary of, it seems The Star Fraction\u2019s unpredicted
    victory against Band of Brothers has proven an inspiration to the team \u2013
    proof that an original idea can cause a great upset: \n\n\u201CI don't think there
    is one big threat in this tournament, it appears very open this time, though I
    will obviously be watching out for people like The Star Fraction and Triumvirate.\u201D
    \n\nSo, if DeStInY. win, aside from likely costing the bookies a lot of isk, what
    will be the result? 5n4keyes does not expect it to greatly affect the alliance\u2019s
    agenda: \n\n\u201CI don't think it would affect any plans we have, though it would
    certainly be a big morale boost, and would no doubt attract a lot of people to
    join our alliance.\u201D \n\nIn just a few days, of course, we will see. Will
    DeStInY shatter the pundit\u2019s predictions and storm through to victory? Or
    will 5n4keyes\u2019 own remark on seeing his team\u2019s grouping prove right?
    \n\n\u201CDeStInY is so ****ed...\u201D \n\n* * *\n\n_More coverage will be available
    live during the tournament. As mentioned above DeStInY. alliance's first match
    is against The Five on Day One._"
