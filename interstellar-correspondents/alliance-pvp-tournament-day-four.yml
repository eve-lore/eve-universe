- body: "Day four of the Alliance PvP Tournament was one of few surprises but the
    results it generated ensured that Saturday will tense in a few groups. Some unique
    tactics including smart bombing fleet commanders podding their own players and
    mining lasers on Megathrons were the highlight of a day that was spoiled by a
    large number of forfeits.\n\nWith the tournament moving into the Second Round,
    many alliances appeared to have given up both on qualifying and the Caldari Navy
    Raven on offer as compensation. The Caldari Gaming Commission certainly has plenty
    of food for thought when they revise the next tournament\u2019s rules, with commentators
    demanding fines for non-participation or a deposit for upon entering.\n\nThe first
    official fight saw Dusk and Dawn register a good win over Serenus Letum and it
    would appear we will be seeing more of them as well as the Five in the later stages.\n\nBand
    of Brothers continue to set the pace, both in the tournament as a whole and in
    Group B, as they remained unbeaten with a flawless win over Fate Weavers. At least
    FW turned up, given that two of BoB\xB4s wins had been walkovers and in something
    of a change to the normal script, something of a long-range fight ensued.\n\nNeeding
    a victory to stay in the tournament, Interstellar Starbase Syndicate saw off Chorus
    of Dawn whilst fielding an all-Caldari line-up. However, they still require Stain
    Alliance to lose to Ushra'Khan on Saturday to have a chance to go further in the
    competition.\n\nIn the battle for top spot in Group C, Mercenary Coalition dominated
    Stain Alliance to book their place in the next round. However, barring a miracle
    both teams should advance.\n\n3rd Front booked their place in the next round with
    a tactical victory over O X I D E.Although they lost a Sabre and Enyo quickly
    against a beam set-up Apocalypse, 3FA just needed to get into range of their opponents
    to start to light them up with their all gank Gallente squad.\n\nGoonSwarm failed
    to register their first points as New Outer Ring Allied Democracy slaughtered
    them, featuring the quickest HAC kill of the tournament. Perhaps enraged by this,
    Remedial, flying the universe\u2019s first smartbombing/nosferatu/cap transfer
    Bombadom managed to pod one of his own men.\n\nMorsus Mihi proved to be too much
    for The Sudden Death Squad, leaving Prime Orbital Systems needing to beat The
    Red Skull on Saturday to have a chance to advance from Group E. They gave themselves
    this opportunity by whitewashing Fountain Alliance, who were making their penultimate
    appearance under that name.\n\nContinuing their outstanding record of not having
    lost a ship, SMASH Alliance scraped past Ascendant Frontier in Group F 1-0. From
    the start ASCN concentrated on the Sabre but with two ships shield transferring
    to it, the destroyer class vessel held out.\n\nThe first kill finally came in
    the seventh minute when the Eris died and this proved to be all the bloodshed
    in the match. Previous rounds seemed to indicate that it was logistical drones
    that kept up SMASH\xB4s incredible record but with ASCN concentrating on these,
    the tank between the five ships proved more than up to the job.ASCN now require
    a win on Saturday to assure their safe passage to the Second Round given that
    THE R0CK conceded to Electus Matari.\n\nStain Empire slaughtered D-L in a Tech
    One versus Tech Two mauling, whilst Free Space Alliance forfeited their game with
    Axiom Empire, who will face Exuro Mortis on Saturday to determine one of the two
    qualifiers from Group G.\n\nThe final two games of the day in Group H provided
    some interesting highlights as with their place in the Second Round assured, Interstellar
    Alcohol Conglomerate fielded a Megathron with mining lasers and snowballs.\n\nAs
    Kaos Empire cruised to a 5-0 win, Caldari\xB4s finest bookkeepers immediately
    cried fix and with the potential losses running into the billions, a State investigation
    appears likely. \n\nAnd in the final battle of the day it was a superb topsy-turvy
    one that saw T R U S T pull off an incredible come-from-behind timed-out win over
    Black Reign Syndicate. Quickly falling behind two ships to zero, TRUST focused
    on their opponents\xB4 Rapier and clawed their way back, pulling ahead when their
    Dominix class battleship somehow found some armour repair from thin air and survived
    long enough to assist in the downfall of BRS\xB4s Absolution.\n\nAll in all it
    was an intriguing day, with competitors adding their unique humour to the experience.
    Going into the concluding Saturday of the tournament many groups are yet to be
    decided adding another layer of intrigue into what promises to be one of the most
    talked about events of the year."
