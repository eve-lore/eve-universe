    \\- Information has surfaced out of Etherium Reach that a temporary non-agression
    pact between the so-called Ethereal Crossing Coalition (comprising Ethereal Dawn
    [ED] and Intrepid Crossing [IRC]) and Red Alliance [RED]. Unconfirmed reports
    allege that RED are undergoing some form of drastic restructuring or are even
    suffering some form of directorial sabotage, but Red Alliance leadership is refusing
    to comment on these matters at this moment in time.  \n  \nRalian Gelain of Best
    Path Inc. is the alliance head of Ethereal Dawn. He confirmed that there is a
    \"temporary non-aggression pact so that they [RED] may remove their assets from
    our space.\" Ralian could not confirm rumors that there was in fact a shakeup
    in RED leadership, saying only that he had _\"much respect for our enemies and
    respect for our allies and alliance mates that have stuck out a tough situation.\"_
    \ \n  \nIn the last three weeks, Red Alliance has gained and held sovereignty
    in multiple systems in Etherium Reach, Scalding Pass and Insmother, but is beset
    by multiple enemies on all sides. Forthcoming reports from the Interstellar Correspondents
    will look into how the withdrawal will affect sovereignty in the region and how
    Red Alliance's current situation will impact its other wars.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you
