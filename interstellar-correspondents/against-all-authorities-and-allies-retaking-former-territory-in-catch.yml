    Catch** \\- In the early hours of 15.01.113, The Initiative. [INIT.] alliance
    lost sovereignty of HY-RWO and GJ0-OJ solar systems to Against ALL Authorities

    Coalition, which comprises, among others, Against ALL Authorities, C0VEN, En Garde
    and ROMANIAN-LEGION is now engaged in sustained fighting in Catch against The
    Initiative. and their subsidiary alliances, Initiative Associates and Initiative
    Mercenaries.   \n  \nIn the last week, Against ALL Authorities have taken some
    8 systems in Catch, while territory held by The Intitiative. and its allies is
    shrinking rapidly.   \n  \nReports flowing from the area indicate that about 900
    vessels took part in the fray on the 15th, including an estimated 19 Titans and
    20 super-carriers.   \n  \nBarbaro55a, an INIT. pilot, described the moment Stain
    Coalition entered HY-RWO. \u201C[We were] ridding the system of pirate rats when
    the Stain Coalition tore into the system through several beacons at the station...
    It seems they had come to brutalise our stations.\u201D   \n  \nThe Initiative\u2019s
    fleet attempted to destroy a Sovereignty Blockade Unit at one of the system's
    stargates, which could have prevented Stain Coalition attacking the station. The
    early stages of the engagement at the SBU were plagued by communications difficulties
    for both sides of the conflict. Though these were resolved in time and the fight
    continued, sources in INIT. said that they were rapidly losing logistic ships
    to the Stain Coalition titans and ultimately decided to withdraw and abandon the
    stations.   \n  \nAccording to pilots from Stain Coalition, fights in Catch are
    likely to escalate in the future as the coalition intends to reclaim the region.
