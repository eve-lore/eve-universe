    Of the 16 matches today, 7 included teams that used some variation of the same-ship-class
    tactic that Match 2 winner Against ALL Authorities used. Of those 7, only 3 were
    able to pull a win with the tactic; proving that there is no specific unbeatable
    combination of ships in a tournament fleet.


    Despite many predictions, all-Ishtar fleets did not make up a majority of fleet
    setups. In fact, only 2 teams actually fielded a 6 Ishtar fleet and both won their
    matches; HUZZAH FEDERATION and Cry Havoc.


    With many eyes on the battlefield reports of Day 1 Qualifying, Day 2 should prove
    interesting as teams review fleet setups and try to outwit their rivals tomorrow.


    Losers of today''s matches still have a chance to make it to the finals depending
    on the results of next week''s Second Round Qualifying where all 64 teams will
    have another chance to prove they can win.


    Coverage will continue throughout the event tomorrow and full match reports can
