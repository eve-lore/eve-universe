- body: "Yesterday night, forces belonging to the MASS corporation and The Collective
    attacked the station located in 3BK-O7 in what appears to be an action instigated
    by a rogue Collective pilot. Held by a Fountain Alliance corporation, Stain\u2019s
    ally, the attack was not only unprovoked, but a surprise as well.   \n  \nThe
    Fountain Alliance was quick to respond. Whilst their diplomats met each other,
    forces were dispatched in case the talks proved pointless. After a few tense hours,
    both parties withdrew, with no loss of lives or valuable assets.   \n  \nTrigger
    and Nathan Voughn of the Stain Alliance and Fountain alliance, respectively, assured
    me that this unfortunate incident did not tarnish their alliances\u2019 relationship
    to each other. The Fountain Alliance and Stain Alliance remain the best of friends.
    \  \n  \nHowever, the situation in Querious drew the attention of a third party.
    BoB, consisting of Arcane Technologies, Evolution, Reikoku and Black Nova Corp,
    somehow heard of the Stain attack on a Fountain station and took the long trip
    down from their claimed regions of Venal, Tenal and Branch to investigate.   \n
    \ \nBoB went \u201CSightseeing\u201D, as Shrike explained to me. However, one
    of the Evolution pilots in the fleet, Shirak, died unexpectedly to a Fountain
    Pilots\u2019 guns. Although his pod escaped unscathed, the attack caused Evolution,
    Reikoku and Black Nova Corp to respond with unrelenting aggression, invading the
    Fountain systems.   \n  \nUnfortunately, we cannot independently verify losses
    on either side of the conflict. According to Shrike of Evolution, several battleships
    on FA\u2019s side were destroyed, alongside a handful of cruisers and frigates.
    \  \n  \nIt is uncertain what the future holds. What seemed to be a simple diplomatic
    matter between the Stain and Fountain Alliance escalated when the BoB fleet arrived
    on the scene. Although Stain forces have withdrawn fully, it is still a strange
    incident. Rumors have it that the Curse alliance, Stain and Fountain\u2019s long-standing
    enemy, have something to do with the lone Collective pilot ordering the attack.
    According to Trigger, they knew about the MASS and Collective fleet\u2019s attack
    even before it began! A strange situation indeed.   \n  \nConcerning BoB and Fountain,
    undoubtedly, the hostilities will continue throughout the day. The Fountain Alliance
    considers it too soon to open diplomatic talks, as Shrike confirms by stating
    they have not yet heard from the Fountain Alliance Council.   \n  \nNo matter
    what happens, it will be interesting to see how this plays out. Is the MASS and
    Collective assault really the result of a Curse Alliance ploy? What of Evolution,
    will they negotiate, or continue the attack on their former friends, the Fountain
    Alliance? Interesting times are ahead."
