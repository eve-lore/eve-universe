- body: "On the evening of the 12th, a fleet belonging to members of the **_State
    Protectorate (STPRO)_** engaged a fleet from the **_Federation Defense Union (FEDEF)_**
    in the Tama system inflicting many casualities. \n\nOnce the battle was engaged
    it would appear that the FEDEF fleet called for assistance from **_Red Alliance
    (RA)_**. RA sent in five carrier class vessels to try to destroy the STPRO fleet,
    unfortunately for them the Caldari pilots were more than up to the challenge.
    \n\nOf the five carriers that entered the battle only two managed to leave, the
    STPRO fleet only lost a Raven and two cruiser class vessels during the engagement.
    \n\nProtectorate Ensign Boromor, who was the Fleet Commander for this action was
    extremely pleased with the way his fleet, most of whom have never flown together
    before, reacted and worked together so well."
