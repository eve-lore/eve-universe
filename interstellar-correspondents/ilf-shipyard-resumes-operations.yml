    Placid** \\- A war earlier this year in Placid between the Intaki Liberation Front
    [ILF] and Moira. forced the closure of the ILF shipyard \"[Prosperity Station](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?article=3455)\"
    in Intaki after 4 months of operation. Following the end of this war, the ILF
    facility is now once again fully operational.  \n  \nSaxon Hawke of the ILF said
    \"The conflict began [roughly two months ago] when Moira. CEO Julianus Soter ordered
    his pilot Seraphim Risen to carry out a suicide attack against one of the Intaki
    Liberation Front miners in Stacmon.\"  \n  \nHawke alleged that the suicide attack
    was a follow-up to public statements by Julianus Soter alleging cooperation between
    the ILF and State Protectorate corporations against the Federal Defense Union.
    He claimed that the ILF was providing information to the Caldari Militia about
    Federal Defence Union activities.   \n  \nSaxon Hawke claimed \"These allegations
    were never substantiated and were, in my opinion, merely a smokescreen for Soter
    and his band of terrorists to attempt to silence the most active voice for Intaki
    secession.\" Julianus Soter, however was adamant that the claims were not only
    true but meticulously verified by his corporation. \"The ILF were implicated in
    an intelligence sharing situation. We verified this, corroborated this evidence
    of cooperation with the State next to other Federal Defense Union members' [NeoCom
    data], looked at historical evidence of ILF's member participation in the State
    conquest of the Intaki system and issued a declaration of war against them to
    rectify the problem.\"  \n  \nThe conflict involved around 35 pilots from Moira.
    and approximately 100 from the ILF. According to both sides the conflict was a
    series of small skirmishes involving cruisers and frigates. The conflict was particularly
    fierce around the Intaki V moon 5 station, which formed an important locus of
    logistics, but ranged as far as Stacmon and Dodixie. Hawke noted that the clash
    was severe enough to force the ILF to halt production at the shipyard \"as a precautionary
    measure to ensure the safety of our civilian workforce.\" This lead to a shortfall
    in ship and module supply on the local market that the shipyard was originally
    constructed to address.  \n  \nFollowing the Federal Defence Union's resecuring
    of Placid, Moira. have left the area to join Rote Kapelle alliance. Julianus Soter
    stated \"From Moira.'s perspective, we have exited the theater of operations and
    are no longer directly concerned with events in the Intaki system... Moira.'s
    departure from the FDU marks the successful completion of our strategic operations
    as delineated six months ago following an attempt to destroy the Leviathan above
    Caldari Prime. With the [liberation of the Intaki system](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?article=3723)
    and the entire Viriette constellation, along with many other systems, we've moved
    onto our next phase of corporate operations.\"  \n  \nWith the conclusion of the
    conflict, Saxon Hawke reported that \"Prosperity Station is back at full production,
    turning out high quality ships and modules. All of the goods produced at the plant
    are available locally on Intaki's markets.\"   \n  \nThe Intaki Liberation Front's
    conflict with the Moira. corporation concluded with neither side sustaining unrecoverable
    losses. Prosperity Station is once again functional and supplying ships and modules
    to the historically understocked Intaki system. The allegations against the ILF
    remain a source of controversy.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in
