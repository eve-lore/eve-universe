    an established name for a few years and are well known for their ability to start
    or end a disagreement rather swiftly. They don\u2019t allow people to stand in
    their way and are used to doing exactly what they want, in their own time. \u2018Adapt
    or Die\u2019 has been a favourite saying of Evolution in the past, according to
    SirMolle it\u2019s not just a motto but fact. Considering their history this doesn\u2019t
    sound too farfetched. It\u2019s clear that SirMolle is different from the other
    pilots who have been interviewed, his answers are brief and too the point. Always
    mindful not to give away too much information that can be used by others in the
    future, Sir Molle remembering Evolution\u2019s first large war:   \n  \nSirMolle:
    \u201COur first \"real\" war was with the creation of FA, where we invaded the
    Fountain region with the help of _Xanadu_ and _OEC_ and _Cornexant_. We wanted
    that region. The locals went up in arms protecting it madly. It ended up with
    us forming the _FA_ who we later killed. We have been in many wars, too many to
    tell them all. In almost every major conflict we have been in the middle. They
    just happen where we are. The _FA_ we later killed was nowhere near the _FA_ we
    formed, they were strangers. We don\u2019t like strangers taking over what we
    create\u201D.   \n  \nIn the past _Evolution_ has been strong Sarum supporters
    and I asked SirMolle more regarding their past as vocal Amarr supporters. At this
    point in time the Amarr affairs are not given a high priority by _Evolution_.
    It the conversation it seems that SirMolle is disappointed and frustrated at the
    Amarr, calling the ones in charge pansy\u2019s. During the coronation ceremony
    Evolution\u2019s most disgruntled pilot called Deathwing tried to assassinate
    the new chosen Emperor. He failed, yet as we all know the last Amarr emperor is
    dead. SirMolle refuses to answer whether Evolution has attempted another assassination
    and succeeded this time. It seems _Evolution_ has no interest in the affairs of
    the Amarr, however if Sarum decides to make a claim to the empty throne _Evolution_
    may step up behind them and give them their support.   \n  \nSo what has the attention
    of _Evolution_ and _BoB_ at the moment? Nothing too outrageous, only the desire
    to take over the entire universe, a region at the time. It seems that SirMolle
    is disappointed with the old Empires and longs for it\u2019s own empire, with
    it\u2019s own emperor. I asked more about this project of Evolution and BoB.   \n
    \ \nArielle deVoir > How far will this empire stretch?   \nSirMolle: There will
    be no boundaries. We will control everything.  \nArielle devoir: All low security
    regions?   \nSirMolle: We are creating an **EMPIRE**. Low security space is like
    stealing candy from babies.   \nArielle devoir: So your goal and BoB's goal is
    to control the entire universe? Every system, every corner and all in the middle?
    \  \nSirMolle : Watch us go.   \n  \nAt this point I started to question the sanity
    of it all, sure Evolution can be confident because their history is filled with
    victories, but attacking all the empires? I told SirMolle that people would think
    it is madness but he\u2019s reply was that Evolution has been considered mad for
    attacking _Curse, Fountain_ and the _Phoenix Alliance_. Then he said the most
    surprising thing :  \n  \nSirMolle > We are, quite mad.   \n  \nI tried to gather
    more information about how _Evolution_ operates, and slavery plays a very interesting
    part in this corporation. It seems many members of this corporation started as
    a slave. SirMolle confided that slaves are given the chance to elevate themselves
    when they give everything to the corporation, their life included. _Evolution
    _is not a common corporation, it\u2019s a machine and everyone is a part of it,
    the CEO included. When you join Evolution you can forget about other issues, Evolution
    will be your new family and it welcomes new relatives if they prove themselves
    worthy by slavery. Valora, a new member of Evolution, said that she is glad to
    have been able to experience several roles before becoming a member. I asked another
    slave if it doesn\u2019t annoy him to take orders, not to be free to decide what
    to do. Talon'dor\u2019 answer : \u201C I do think for myself, it is not my masters
    need to understand how I carry out his bidding to the most minute of details.
    I am free to be creative in this manner so long as it meets his goal, which is
    one I believe in too, so therefore it is my own goal\u201D. For many Evolution
    has gone too far in this new approach to slavery, now even pilots graduated from
    the best academy\u2019s enter slavery or at least servitude willingly.  \n  \nSome
    readers may remember the articles on Jade Constantine and Viger Fell, both people
    who fight to be free of all constraints. There seems to be a real contradiction
    in what they fight for and what _Evolution_ and even _BoB_ desire, a new empire
    with a new emperor. SirMolle doesn\u2019t expect a real resistance from the Minmatar
    for his and his corporation acts of slavery nor from _Jericho_. _Jericho_ is smart
    and realises when something is impossible to accomplish, they remain friends of
    BoB because they are useful. SirMolle would not say what function Jericho performs
    that makes them useful at this time.   \n  \nLike _Evolution_ the alliance _Bands
    of Brothers_ seems to work as a machine, each corporation who is a member brings
    something to the whole and they are their better and worse half\u2019s. SirMolle
    is confident that the war with _Imperium_ will be over soon, according to SirMolle
    the corporations are leaving the alliance daily.   \n  \nSirMolle: \u201CWe expect
    them to seek shelter further north. It's a pity, we expected more.\u201D   \nArielle
    deVoir: \u201CDo you regret it in a way that no one has offered any real resistance
    to BoB?\u201D   \nSirMolle: \u201CYes, we thrive on challenges; we seek them out
    and live off them.\u201D"
