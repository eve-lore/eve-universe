    results and reviews of the first eight matches of the day. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match
    65: The Star Fraction Vs The Kadeshi**\n\nThe Kadeshi come away with a points
    loss, still managing to knock The Star Fraction out of a finals placement and
    securing themselves a spot instead.\n\n**The Star Fraction:** 5 Cerberus | 5 Griffins
    \ \n**The Kadeshi:** 4 Vagabonds | Fleet Issue Stabber | Keres | Kitsune | Vigil\n\nWith
    the two team formations staring each other down at the beginning of the fight,
    it looked as if The Star Fraction would cruise through comfortably. As the Vagabonds
    and support picked up some immense speed from the beginning however, the fight
    was quickly swinging against SF with their missiles making no impact on anything
    except the Vigil and Kitsune.\n\nCaptainOkuna\u2019s Cerberus came under Vagabond
    fire and was all but dead, with only a sliver of hull remaining. Saved by some
    last-minute logistics however, he hung on just barely. Refusing to cave, SF kept
    up the pressure and slowly dropped the Fleet Issue Stabber, then scored some more
    needed points when the Keres dropped from the field. Unable to dent the speed
    tanks of the rest of the ships however, with all of them breaking 4km/s, SF sat
    there helplessly as they watched a finals placing slip away from them. \n\n* *
    *\n\n**Match 66: When Fat Kids Attack Vs Molotov Coalition**\n\nThis match didn\u2019t
    matter for group placement, with Molotov sitting comfortable. They came through
    with another win, solidifying their place even further as the group leaders.\n\n**When
    Fat Kids Attack:** Armageddon | 2 Dominix  \n**Molotov Coalition:** Absolution
    | 2 Hurricane | Harbinger | 2 Mallers\n\nWith some early pressure on a Molotov
    Hurricane, it looked as it the FATTY team might come away with a win. The fight
    swung quickly around however, as Molotov logistics kept their ship safe and their
    own offensive started chipping away at a Dominix. Exchanging a Dominix for a Maller,
    the fight started to slip away from FATTY, and their next two Battleships followed
    shortly afterwards. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 67: SMASH Alliance Vs Synchr0nicity**\n\nSMASH
    withdrew from the fight, refusing to field a team. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 68: Notoriety
    Alliance Vs Green Alliance**\n\nWith both teams through to the final there was
    little riding on this match except training, pride and perhaps morale. Notoriety
    came out with a killer team however, and both sides clashed together in what must
    be one of the most amazing match ups so far.\n\n**Notoriety Alliance:** Nightmare
    | 3 Phantasms | Scimitar | Succubus  \n**Green Alliance:** 2 Hurricanes | 2 Ishtar
    | Curse | Maller\n\nIt was easily one of the closest and most exciting matches
    yet, with Notoriety fielding a faction-heavy team and coming up against some very
    stiff opposition from Green Alliance. Early on in the fight Green Alliance was
    swamped by ECM drones and had their Curse made primary. The Notoriety team Succbus
    was first blood however, dropping shortly before the Curse was taken down. Another
    Succubus fell as an Ishtar went into armor.\n\nGreen continued to bring it hard,
    pressuring the logistics pilot of Notoriety to the absolute limit as they switched
    between Phantasms. Clinging on to what was only 3% structure by the end, with
    the other deep into hull, the logistics assistance to them both was timed to perfection.
    Green was slowly whittled down by the huge damage output, losing their Ishtars
    then Hurricanes as the Phantasms just managed to survive. It was another very
    impressive showing from Notoriety, their first two lost ships of the tournament
    costing them prime placing within their group. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 69: Mercenary
    Coalition Vs Brutally Clever Empire**\n\nAnother match that didn\u2019t determine
    finals placing, Bruce went for the highly-vaunted 10 Blackbird in honor of commentator
    SpiralJunkie.\n\n**Mercenary Coalition:** Scorpion | Basilisk | 4 Phantasm  \n**Brutally
    Clever Empire:** The Spiral Formation\u2122 of 10 Blackbirds\n\nWith the MC team
    thoroughly jammed from the beginning, Bruce made the call to clear their drones
    from the field slowly - all in order to stop what damage there was coming. It
    was a questionable decision of theirs, with 2 Blackbirds dropping whilst MC sat
    there helpless and vulnerable, watching their drones do the work. As the ECM capability
    dropped with every ship, Bruce found themselves at the end of Phantasm fire, which
    quickly cleared the field and gave MC a totalhelldeath. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 70:
    Ethereal Dawn Vs Cry Havoc.**\n\nAnother battle for Finals placement this time,
    Cry Havoc came away with the win using some clever on-field strategy and team
    formations, denying their opponents a position in the final 16.\n\n**Ethereal
    Dawn:** Scorpion | Basilisk | 2 Curse | Phantasm  \n**Cry Havoc.:** 3 Dominix
    | Guardian\n\nCry Havoc\u2019s Dominix started the fight by launching sentries
    as they charged into the fray. Moments later as they\u2019d cleared their own
    drones, they dropped in amidst the logistics ones of their enemies which supporting
    the Scorpion. A cleverly positioned and well-timed Dominix smartbomb cleared their
    enemies logistics support from the field and the Scorpion was first to drop as
    a result. The Cry Havoc Guardian dropped quickly afterwards, having taken a great
    amount of fire and cap neutralization from the Curse. Cry Havoc moved on to drop
    the Basilisk and the Phantoms next, managing to keep a Dominix in low armor alive
    as they cleared the rest of the field. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 71: The Crimson Federation
    Vs Blade.**\n\nAn important match for Crimson who needed the points for finals
    placement. They were robbed of a fighting chance as their Hyperion dropped moments
    before the match.\n\n**The Crimson Federation:** Abaddon | Dominix | Harbinger
    | Hyperion (dropped)  \n**Blade.:** Maelstrom | Raven | Curse | Caracal | Kitsune
    | Hyena | Vigil\n\nMaking the Curse primary, Crimson tried to hold out without
    their 3rd Battleship, but found some harsh firepower from Blade eating into their
    Harbinger quickly. Exchanging the loss of their Battlecruiser for a single Kitsune,
    the fight was never really looking in Crimson\u2019s favor. They managed to just
    take down the Curse before their Abaddon, the last ship remaining, was removed
    from the field. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 72: Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate Vs
    Phalanx Alliance**\n\nAnother match that decided finals placement, and another
    massive bet riding on this one, IAC went down once again as Phalanx fielded a
    clever formation presumably designed to deal with the dual-logistics. They employed
    their strategy masterfully, using it well to knock IAC out of the tournament.\n\n**Interstellar
    Alcohol Conglomerate:** Drake | 2 Basilisks | 3 Phantasms  \n**Phalanx Alliance
    :** Abaddon | 2 Scorpions | Rook | Vigil\n\nVery little happened in the opening
    moments of the match; a Phalanx Rook was threatened momentarily before ECM was
    applied once again. IAC sat there largely helpless as Phalanx laid down heavy
    fire on a Basilisk and jammed them, waiting for the ECM to deal with the other
    Basilisk. That jam came eventually and the Basilisk dropped fast without support.
    From there Phalanx was free to clear the rest of the field. \n\n* * *\n\n_Eve-TV
