    Providence** - Following the invasion of their sovereign space in Catch earlier
    this year by the coalition of Providence sovereignty holders, Against ALL Authorities
    [.-A.-] removed Libertas Fidelitas Alliance [LFA] from the systems they had captured
    in Catch and launched a retaliatory strike against D-GTMI in Providence, held
    by Paxton Federation.  \n  \nThe beginning of this year saw Against ALL Authorities
    engaged in a two-front war against GoonSwarm in Delve and the Providence Holders
    in Catch, but [GoonSwarm's lapsed upkeep payments](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?article=3680)
    in Delve, Querious and Period Basis and their subsequent forcible dissolution
    by lead Goon, karttoon freed Against ALL Authorities' leading fleet commanders
    to return to the Catch front along with allies including Ushra'Khan, Systematic
    Chaos and AAA Citizens.   \n  \nSeveral engagements took place during this period
    as the Providence Holders mustered to defend their new territorial claims. Galandrius
    Malkin, formerly of LFA reported that battles took place in SV5-BN, F9E-KX and
    also WD-VTV.   \n  \nLipot, a member of one of the alliances operating in conjunction
    with Curatores Veritatis Alliance [CVA] and LFA reported that active support in
    the conflict was provided by more than just the official Providence Holder alliances.
    \"There [was] an active 'Neut' fleet that operated under the guidance of one of
    the CVA fleet commanders. The number of pilots at any given time [was] around
    150 in the fights with others coming in as relief. Our corporation resides in
    Lower Domain and Providence, respecting CVA/LFA rules of engagement. We are termed
    as 'Neuts' to them but they are 'Blues' to us.\" Regarding the battles in Catch
    and Providence, Lipot added, \"It is pushing a lot of the smaller corps' and alliances'
    resources to the limit but we are all fighting to have a safe haven in 0.0.\"
    \  \n  \nBy the end of last month, LFA had been removed from its recently-claimed
    systems in Catch by AAA and their allies and as retaliation, Against ALL Authorities
    launched an attack against the D-GTMI system in Providence.   \n  \nAn anonymous
    source close to AAA reported that \"D-GTMI was a scheduled 'Call to Arms' as far
    as I know, with the intention of forcing the [Providence Holders] to back off
    on their imperial intentions.\"   \n  \nTheSprite of Core Factor described his
    part the battles for D-GTMI. \"It all looked like it was going to plan; myself
    and alliance Core Factor joined up with CVA and Holders to form a capital fleet
    of... 140+ ships.\" With heavy battleship and battlecruiser support, the full
    fleet exceeded 600 ships in his estimation.   \n  \nTheSprite described the fleet
    he was in entering the contested system by titan-bridge and moving to a tower
    to engage the enemy. Infiltrators within the fleet had allegedly passed the location
    of the tower and its forcefield password to commanders in AAA's and their allies'
    fleets. The AAA capital fleet, estimated by TheSprite to consist of \"13 titans
    and maybe 60 - 80 dreadnoughts\" jumped onto the tower and deployed warp interdiction
    spheres (commonly known as \"bubbles\") around the CVA tower, catching an estimated
    20 capitals outside the tower's shields.   \n  \nTheSprite continued \"Our Fleet
    Commander then made the decision to warp out of the bubble and regroup 300km from
    the current position so that the rest of the fleet could reform there.\" This
    gambit did not go as planned, with pilots reporting drastic system failures heavily
    interfering with fleet operations - overviews were slow or failed to load entirely,
    with many pilots complaining of inability to exit warp, activate or deactivate
    modules or arriving completely sensor-blind.   \n  \nTheSprite explained \"The
    order was then given to re-enter the [tower] shield but after we did so, AAA used
    their advantage of having the forcefield password and warped in a large gang of
    Battleships which proceeded to bump some of our capital fleet members out of the
    shield who ultimately died at the hands of the AAA titans' new 'doomsday' weapons
    - by this time AAA had 10 bubbles surrounding the [structure] which made it impossible
    to both warp out and warp in... without getting caught in one, so the order was
    given to jump out of the system completely, form up and try to re-enter once again
    via Titan-bridge.\"   \n  \n\"The rest of the non-capital fleet started to battle
    once we had regrouped with the capital fleet again, we jumped back into D-GTMI\u2026
    but by this time the [system failures were affecting around] 90% of our capital
    fleet [which lead to the retreat order] in hopes that it might salvage some of
    the capital fleet and reduce the losses but\u2026 this wasn't good enough as a
    majority of the pilots whilst [retreating] found their capitals had been destroyed
    [while affected by the system's temporo-spatial anomalies].   \n  \n\"The rest
    of the non-cap fleet did their best to try and defend the [affected] capital ships,
    but in the end were fought back. AAA then proceeded to attack the station and
    put it into its second stage of reinforced mode, thus ending the battle. I believe
    that, if the circumstances were different and the [spatial anomalies had not affected
    our fleet] we would have had the upper hand in this battle.\"   \n  \nAsked if
    he was participating actively in the on-going Providence conflict TheSprite stated
    \"Unfortunately no, I've been rebuilding my capital ship after the loss in D-GTMI.\"
    \  \n  \nGalandrius Malkin comments that \"our fleet was well-lead on a tactical
    level, however, higher leadership was sorely lacking. Command took hours to make
    simple decisions, and often we made bad decisions such as [warping back and forth].\"
    \  \n  \nMalkin cites the anomalous and unpredicatable behaviour of the afflicted
    ships' systems as a major factor in the loss, but states that it was aggravated
    by some command decisions. \"However, this wasn't the only problem. AAA made very
    good use of spying mechanics and they gained the passwords to our capital ships'
    safe [structures] and proceeded to bump the ships out into engagement range. AAA
    also had a commendable cap fleet and was very well organized, which was still
    effective [against the spatial anomalies] both sides experienced.\"   \n  \nBy
    being set up within the system before the engagement began, the AAA ships may
    have held an advantage in that they had more time than the incoming Providence
    fleet to load environmental data into overloaded sensors and to get themselves
    into position, though they too reported problems with modules either firing up
    or shutting down.   \n  \nAn anonymous source close to former LFA affiliates reports
    that \"There was [a severe mistake] in D-GTMI\u2026 We had a strong fleet of conventional
    ships in system, but were ordered to just sit in a [tower] while our capitals
    were getting slaughtered and the capital fleet received orders to warp off grid
    and then back\u2026 to die.\"   \n  \nAralis, executor of CVA, was emphatic that
    that the battle for D-GTMI was \"sabotaged\" by the anomalous behaviours they
    experienced and expressed a belief that these unforeseen circumstances were wholly
    responsible for the outcome of the engagement. Sapphrine of Ushra'Khan, however,
    felt that [Providence Command's decisions from the outset of the battle](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eveonline.com/iNgameboard.asp?a%3Dtopic%26threadID%3D1252096%26page%3D6)
    led to circumstances in which the anomalies were able to cripple the Providence
    fleet beyond recovery.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Ushra'Khan Alliance Battle
