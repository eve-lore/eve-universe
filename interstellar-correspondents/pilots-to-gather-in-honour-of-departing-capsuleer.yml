    \\- A gathering on the evening of 1.30.113 has been scheduled to honour Poreuomai,
    a pilot that served as a faithful representative of the ideals held by the Minmatar
    Republic.  \n  \nPoreuomai was considered by many to be a cornerstone of the Minmatar
    capsuleer \u200Bcommunity and will be missed by capsuleers throughout New Eden.
    Ugleb of Sarz'na Kumatari is leading the efforts to gather capsuleers wishing
    to pay their respects to Poreuomai, who will be departing the capsuleer community
    permanently as he searches for a new life planet-side.  \n  \nThough many in the
    close knit Minmatar loyalist community are saddened\u200B by his transition to
    a life outside the confines of a spacecraft, Ugleb emphasizes that pilots should
    remember the pilot Poreuomai was, as \"That is what we seek to celebrate, and
    it is that spirit we shall gather to honour.\"  \n  \nHis impact on many pilots
    was quite apparent; Shinda Tenshi, a member of the Sacred Templars recalls that
    \"He has been there for me more than once and i don't think I can ever thank him
    enough.\"  \n  \nAny capsuleers wishing to pay respects\u200B are invited to join
    Ugleb on Sunday at 2100 in the Pator system.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the
