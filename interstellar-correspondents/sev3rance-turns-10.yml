    New Eden -** Ten years ago, in early February of YC109, a small group of pilots
    came together with the idea that they could make Sukanen, a low security system,
    safe from 'pirate' activity. FuriousPig and Irons of IronPig [IRPG] and Dreamy
    of Mystic Lion Hearts [-MLH-] formed Sev3rance [-7-] with the hopes that they
    could manage active aggression through the standings system of NRDS [Not Red,
    Don't Shoot].\n\nAlthough the prevailing attitude from outsiders was that the
    program could never succeed, they in fact did make it work, and in the process
    developed a reputation that others noticed. Among those was Curatores Veritatis
    Alliance [CVA], who were attempting the same thing in 0.0 Providence. It was not
    long before -7- was invited out to North Providence to see if they could manage
    the same successful results.\n\nMany Alliances have accomplished great things
    through the history of New Eden, however few can say that they have accomplished
    those goals over as long a time period as -7- has. They can count themselves among
    such notables as long-time allies Curatores Veritatis Alliance [CVA] and other
    well-known names such as Against All Authorities [.-A-.] and Ushra'Khan, who will
    turn 13 later this year.\n\nIronPig [IRPG] pilot and long time Providence resident
    iiOs explains, \"It's the community we created\u2026 we don't have that elite
    culture.\" He goes on to explain that new members are welcomed to the fold, but
    ultimately their success depends on their level of integration to the team.   \n\nFor
    the combat pilot, finding a fight is rarely a problem in Providence. The industrialist
    looking to build ships and modules to replace losses can have a more difficult
    task under these conditions, but the rewards can be worth the frustration. Despite
    the occasional industrial loss consisting of jump freighters or Rorquals, industrial
    pursuits continue in the region. For all intents and purposes, leadership appear
    to have found that happy medium which allows for the majority of their members
    to find what they need to be happy.\n\nIn speaking with FuriousPig, one certainly
    gets the impression that he speaks his mind, and calls it as he sees it, \"I keep
    no secrets from [my people] and they get to know what's going on,\" he states.\n\nIt
    has not been an easy road for Sev3rance. They were forcibly removed from Providence
    for a host period of time several years ago along with CVA and the rest of the
    Provibloc coalition. Being displaced gave them the chance to look at their commitment
    to their cause, and after some months, returned to take back their home. From
    that time, they have remained the stalwart guardians of the north in Providence.
    \ Whatever the reason, love them or hate them, they have made their mark in their
    space, and don't appear ready to give up any time soon.\n\n[Sev3rance Killboard](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/982284363/)"
