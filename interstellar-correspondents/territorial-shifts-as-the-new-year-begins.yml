    Genesis** \\- As New Eden enters the year 113, there have been minor shifts in
    the balance of power in null security space.   \n  \nFrom 01 - 02.01.113, Rebel
    Alliance of New Eden [RANE] and Majesta Empire [ME] are recorded as having the
    largest territorial gains. RANE has gained three systems in Wicked Creek - 30-YOU,
    4F89-U and J7-BDX - after Marine Holdings, formerly of Jagged Alliance, joined
    RANE. ME, meanwhile, resecured two systems in Vale of The Silent - KX-2UI and
    MO-FIF - after The Praxis Initiative left them to join Gentlemen's Agreement.
    \  \n  \nThe largest losses of the period befell Circle-Of-Two, who typically
    see a period of low membership and activity towards the end of a year and into
    the start of a new one. They dropped sovereignty in two systems in Impass - 9-IIBL
    and 3-UCBF. R.A.G.E also lost sovereignty in two systems in The Kalevala Expanse
    - F48K-D and UJXC-B.   \n  \nCold Steel Alliance erected the first outpost of
    113: an Amarr Factory installation in A3-RQ3, Vale of The Silent.   \n  \nThe
    current alliance rankings (ordered by number of outposts) place IT Alliance in
    the lead with 61 outposts and 5600 members. Second is The Initiative with 42 outposts
    and 1600 members, while Legion of xXDEATHXx is third with 36 outposts and 1100
    members.   \n  \nWhile relatively quiet on the territorial front in its opening
    days, 113 will not be without its heavy wars. Fighting between Pandemic Legion
    and their former allies in the Northern Coalition is ongoing in Venal over valuable
    Technetium moons, Goonswarm Federation and their allies, Test Alliance Please
    Ignore, are fighting IT Alliance in Fountain in the latest incarnation of past
    wars between Goonswarm and Band of Brothers and it remains to be seen whether
    Providence's sovereignty will stabilize.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events
