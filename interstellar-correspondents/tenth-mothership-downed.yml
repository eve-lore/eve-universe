    to the growing firepower of a mixed Band of Brothers and Mercenary Coalition fleet,
    history was made. Not only was it another mothership loss and a key moment in
    the continuing conflict in the south, but it was a milestone too. \n\nIt was the
    tenth Mothership-class vessel to be downed, an event heralding the beginning of
    a new era. One where thousands of lives can be extinguished in fleeting moment.
    It served as a solemn reminder of many things; the unprecedented scale of loss
    the capital era has brought to New Eden, where individual pod pilots will come
    to play a crucial role in the fate of tens of thousands of crew, and also their
    own alliances and corporations, who sink vast amounts of time and resources into
    their construction and protection. \n\nThe Aeon was lost in the FAT-6P system,
    where a tired Tyrrax, whose \"reaction time was off\" was \"probed down and jumped
    by the BoB/MC fleet.\" Without any sizeable support, it was taken down eventually
    as the BoB/MC fleets slowly grew to a force capable of taking the behemoth down.\n\n\u201CLosing
    ships doesn\u2019t bother me much,\u201D stated Thorrk, who is well-known across
    the entire cluster for not only fielding the most rare and expensive ships on
    offer, but for losing them fearlessly on the field of battle. \u201CThere\u2019s
    not much point in having a ship if you don\u2019t use it,\u201D Thorrk remarked.
    \n\nHer attitude is a source of admiration, derision and bafflement across the
    cluster. Some look on with both amazement and scorn at the epic losses Thorrk
    is known for, whilst others sing only songs of respect for a capsuleer warrior
    unafraid to field the most expensive and rare vessels in risky open combat. \u201CI
    don\u2019t bother undocking unless I\u2019m prepared to lose my ship,\u201D Thorrk
    said causally. \u201CYou can knock us down, but you can\u2019t keep us down...we\u2019ll
    take anything we lost back.\u201D \n\nThis most recent event brings the tally
    of Mothership losses to a double digit figure, perhaps highlighting that in the
    future, the downing of a Mothership will become increasingly insignificant as
    the wealth and power of well-organized frontier alliances grows. \n\nGlorious
    and risky battle is not the only way one can lose a Mothership these days however.
    It is worth noting that these ships in particular have been the focus of New Eden\u2019s
    less-than-scrupulous entrepreneurs, who have scammed their way into the command
    seat of these giant beasts. There is an entire racketeering market centered around
    pilfering these vessels, a profession and arguably, an art, which will be the
    subject of an upcoming Interstellar Correspondents article. \n\nIn the meantime
