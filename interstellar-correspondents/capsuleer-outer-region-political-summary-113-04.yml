- body: "**Y113.04.01 - Y113.04.30** _._\n\nThe northern war between the Drone Region
    Forces (DRF) and the Northern Coalition (NC) has continued heating up, with almost
    all conquerable stations within the Geminate region falling to the attacking DRF.
    This escalation has seen fighting push on into the Vale of the Silent region,
    where further stations have changed hands. There is significant speculation that
    the NC has arranged an organised withdrawal into the key region of Tribute, the
    home of the Morsus Mihi alliance.  \n  \nVale saw the highest number of ship losses
    this month compared with any other region, with CONCORD having records of 14,393
    vessels being destroyed in capsuleer vs capsuleer combat. Geminate saw a further
    10,951 losses. The information held by CONCORD regarding the losses in these regions
    suggest that the attacking forces have been involved in destroying a considerably
    higher number of ships than the defenders, with major alliances belonging to the
    DRF scoring 13,169 final blows compared to the NC's 6,277.  \n  \nDespite the
    increasing scope of this conflict, CONCORD only has records of three titans and
    seven supercarriers being lost in the area compared to 20 titans and 30 supercarriers
    last month. It would appear that the massive scale of supercapital losses in previous
    months has discouraged the coalitions from continuing to deploy them in potentially
    volatile situations.\n\n_For an explanation of what CORPS is and to find links
