    notice of a young, quick witted and sometimes foolhardy capsuleer named[ Innominate
    Nightmare](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=370209&page=1#1\n).
    Much to the dismay of his instructors at the Caldari State War Academy, he decided
    to jump in a shuttle and head off to unsecure space in search of what he termed
    \u201CThe meaning of life\u201D. Recently though, his actions have made some people
    wonder if his intentions are philosophical or financial in nature. \n\nHis journey
    so far has taken him from the Venal region in the north to the Stain region in
    the south and he has had many interesting, amusing, romantic and sometimes dangerous
    encounters with capsule pilots in the many solar systems he has visited. \n\nWhen
    asked what his most memorable experience has been so far, he answered, \u201Cit
    could be quite difficult to choose a favourite, although if I were forced to pick
    I would have to go with the [parade of capital ships](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=370209&page=19#554\n)
    that ASCN gave me to when I first arrived at their home system.\u201D \n\nAlthough
    he had started his self appointed \u2018experiment\u2019 with a meagre one million
    ISK, his [wallet soon grew](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=370209&page=19#541)
    with donations from pilots he has encountered. Some have given him money or ships,
    while others have offered to let him fly with them as they destroyed pirates and
    let him take a portion of any salvageable equipment or cargo. \n\nHis self generated
    celebrity has caused Innominate to also become the target of some amorous approaches
    from other pod pilots, most notably [Missytrex ]( http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=370209&page=22#638)
    who promised him a vast fortune, and Frivolous who offered to kill [Missytrex](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=bigshot&cid=803498274\n)
    to [acquire his favor](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=370209&page=26#770).
    Innominate briefly flirted with the idea of hiring the Mercenary Coalition to
    dispatch Missytrex so he could steal her assets and run off with Frivolous, but
    this scheme was short lived after the [Mercenary Coalition refused](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=370209&page=28#841)
    the contract. \n\nJust recently though Innominate has offered to let pilots purchase
    [shares](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=370209&page=31#905\n)
    in his one man corporation named \u201CInnominate Neutrality\u201D. \n\nValued
    at one million ISK per share, he has made five thousand shares available to potential
    investors as souvenirs of his experiment, while keeping five thousand and one
    shares for him self as CEO. Many capsuleers have already invested in \u201CInnominate
    Neutrality\u201D even though he has said publicly that he has no business plan.
    Innominate explained, \u201CI now found myself with a balance rapidly approaching
    one billion ISK\u201D. \n\nMany are wondering what the future holds for \u201CInnominate
    Neutrality\u201D and it\u2019s adventurous CEO."
