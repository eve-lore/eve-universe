    \ by ISD Tedra Kerrigan\n\nThe sudden appearance of snowball-firing 'Festival
    Launchers' in many pilots' inventory - apparently a gift from the mysterious Polaris-based
    alliance C C P - has led to an upsurge in random attacks in many parts of New
    Eden.\n\nTrade hubs seem to be heavily affected, with Jita and Amarr seeing periodic
    outbreaks of snowball-related violence, but no system has escaped unscathed. CONCORD
    officials stated that they saw no harm in these attacks, and were found to be
    in favor of 'harmless fun'. They have modified their detection algorithms to ignore
    snowball attacks. This is a change from a previous year when nervous capsuleers,
    upon being attacked with snowballs, responded with live ammunition, drawing CONCORD
    attention. The snowball-firing attackers then proceeded to loot the hair-triggered
    unfortunates' wrecks. Serious consequences were averted when the snowballs melted
    several months later.\n\nLongtime Jita resident Mars Theran said that he had attacked
    several bystanders in Jita, throwing snowballs with abandon, and stated that he
    thought the snowballs were fun.\n\nWhile pilots across New Eden indulge in 'harmless'
    snowball attacks on each other, one cannot but wonder if these 'Festival Launchers'
    may be the stepping stones for something more dangerous.\n\nWhat is the ultimate
    plan of this potentially sinister and mysterious alliance?\n\n \n\n* * *\n\nAre
