- body: "The Great War in the south continues with large-scale conflict in Delve now
    becoming a regular occurrence. In the last couple of days fighting has centered
    on QY6-RK as both sides are attempting to establish control towers while destroying
    those of their opponents. \n\nAccording to KSUDruid, a BoB director, and Siddy,
    a front line captain, early fighting saw the deployment of a BoB Titan piloted
    by Shrike as they drove back efforts by their opponents to operate in QY6-RK.
    \u201CMy eyes are still blind,\u201D Siddy said, \u201Cand I\u2019m being treated
    in the medical bay due to the doomsday device that went off.\u201D \n\nOn the
    other hand, this reporter witnessed a later battle between approximately 100 ships
    from GoonSwarm, IRON, RAZOR, Pandemic Legion, Rule of Three and Morsus Mihi versus
    an 80 ship BoB fleet at the J-LPX7 gate in QY6-RK. In this battle BoB was pushed
    back and its enemies were able to enter QY6-RK to continue the starbase warfare
    there. \n\nKSUDruid stated that \u201Cmorale is extremely high amongst the fleets.
    I know the troops have been doing very well.\u201D He went on to say BoB believes
    that \u201Csomething like 30,000 pilots in 0.0 are attacking us;\u201D and in
    a further tongue-in-cheek remark stated that \u201Cno one organization stands
    out more than the rest, they all pretty much blend together in their blind hatred
    of our peaceful empire we\u2019ve built here in Delve.\u201D \n\nSpeaking of the
    earlier action, Siddy remarked that \u201Cthe rumored fleet commander of the Goons
    decided to give us all they had, for which we thank them. Nevertheless, the situation
    is now under control and we are, as I speak, [repairing] the final cynojammer
    back to full health.\u201D \n\nSpeaking of the early action also, TheAdj, a fleet
    commander from RAZOR Alliance, stated that \u201Cearlier today BoB moved in a
    horde of capital ships...reinforced several towers and planted several of their
    own.\u201D He then went on to speak of the later events by saying, \u201Cthe objective
    for tonight was to reestablish control over the system to allow us to reinforce
    their towers and save ours.\u201D TheAdj claimed that in the process of securing
    their towers, 30+ BOB battleships had been destroyed in the action, but emphasized
    that he didn\u2019t have an accurate count of kills at that time as reports were
    still coming in.\n\nWhen asked if the later action had succeeded TheAdj said,
    \"I would say so. We held the field and BOB didn't deploy capitals on the gate
    so they knew we were going to hold it.\" \n\nSpeaking of the Great War TheAdj
    added, \u201Cthis is probably the most epic fight in the history of the galaxy
    by far, and it has been a blast fighting BoB. They\u2019re excellent fighters
    and deserve good mention even if they are hostile.\u201D \n\nIt is clear from
    these reports that the war in QY6 may go on for some time, with both sides making
    progress at different periods in a hotly-contested area. BoB has a station in
    system and the numerous moons up for grabs mean that the control tower war could
    potentially be a long and difficult one for both sides."
