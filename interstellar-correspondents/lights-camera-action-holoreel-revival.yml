- body: "In recent times the prevalence of In Capsule Entertainment systems has led
    to the gradual decline of communal holoplexes. This may be changing with the release
    of a number of high profile holoreels which are being distributed to holoplexes
    by GalNet's Public Holo Service. \n\nThere have always been a number of private
    corporate and alliance funded production companies which have dominated the holo
    market. The decline of the plexes and the pursuant reduction in profits led to
    costs and overheads being cut in an attempt to stimulate business. This has led
    to an influx of production companies making new holoreels. \n\nThree holoreels
    which are currently being distributed and shown in plexes are the Gargamel's Lair
    production \"Carebear Sorrows\" directed by Vasili vonHolst, Mercenary Coalition's
    production \"Tortuga - Lacrimosa\" edited by Dire Lauthris, and Holy Cow/Veto
    Productions' \"A Life So Changed\" directed by Cown. These three reels although
    only released recently are enjoying huge success. \n\nReports suggest that the
    demand for Cown's latest release was so great that there were queues forming in
    order to view it, prompting GalNet to increase its distribution efforts. \n\nWhether
    the upturn in fortunes signals a revival in the public plex business remains to
    be seen. However for the moment it seems the cameras will keep rolling. \n\n_External
