    Sinq Laison** - On 17.05.112, Planet III in the Jel system was raided by Sansha's
    Nation supported by a group known as \"Friends of Nation.\"   \n  \nThe fleet
    from Friends of Nation broadcast Nation leader Master Kuvakei's message to the
    capsuleers of New Eden; a message that they say is about equality, protection
    and guidance.   \n  \n[![Nightmare protects dropships above Jel III](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3895/nightmarethumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3895/nightmare.png)It
    is believed that around 110,000 citizens were taken from Jel III. Ghost Hunter,
    a Friends of Nation representative, had this statement: \"I am disappointed more
    from the planet could not be liberated from their shackles. Capsuleers fight against
    us for they are ignorant, but they will be shown the truth.\" Another member said
    \"We [do not] let petty differences divide us, unlike the Minmatar and Amarr at
    the battle of Kamela.\"   \n  \nDuring other battles, Friends of Nation have generated
    cynosural fields for Nation capitals, created diversions, attempted to lure capsuleer
    defence forces into traps and, in low-security space, engaged such forces on the
    Nation's behalf.   \n  \nThe Nation forces were finally repulsed by the capsuleers
    who had come to the aid of the planet and no further incursions were reported
    within the system. Friends of Nation have [vowed to give Master Kuvakei whatever
    support and assistance they can](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eveonline.com%2Fingameboard.asp%3Fa%3Dtopic%26threadID%3D1318980)
