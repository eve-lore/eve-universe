    **JGW-OT, Catch** \\- In the early hours of 03.11.112, Initiative Mercenaries
    [IM] claimed several systems in the 6JCS-4 constellation of Catch and now hold
    all but two systems in this constellation. The captured systems were previously
    held by Against ALL Authorities [.-A-.].   \n  \nThe Initiative. is currently
    the primary sovereignty holder in Catch, claiming three more outposts in the NNLX-K
    constellation. This activity appears to mark the end of Against ALL Authorities'
    sovereignty in Catch, at least for the time being.   \n  \nIn the last month,
    .-A-. has lost all space in Catch, due to an invasion spearheaded by [INIT.] and
    their allies. l3VGV, CEO of Rage and Terror, an Against ALL Authorities corporation,
    stated \"...We [were] punished for helping ATLAS. [When ATLAS collapsed] much
    of [them] joined our [current] enemies...\" She added, however, \"Catch will be
    ours again.\"   \n  \nThis comes on the heels of a string of sovereingty claims
    by Initiative Mercenaries, with 13 new claims arising in a single week, growing
    their territory to nearly 40 systems.   \n  \nAttempts to contact repesentatives
    from The Initiative. and Initiative Mercenaries have been unsuccessful at this
    time.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this article? Do you have
