    first elected president on Saturday in Yulai. Hundreds of Xetic members, as well
    as representatives from most of the other major alliances, turned out to witness
    the event and participate in the festivities.   \n  \nThe onlookers cheered as
    Conram of the XTrading Company, and CYVOK of Celestial Horizon were sworn in as
    President and Vice President respectively. President Conram made a stirring speech
    about the future and called upon the Concord Registry of Nations to recognize
    Xetic as a true independent power, with nation status on an equal footing with
    all other states. While holding out the hand of friendship to the Amarr Empire,
    Minmatar Republic, Gallante Federation and Caldari State, Conram firmly requested
    recognition on the same level as these recognized states. When the speeches had
    concluded, a large rally was held outside a Concord station in Yulai in hopes
    of an official response. As of this time, no official responce is forthcoming,
    and none of the nation states have deemed to comment.   \n  \nThe Xetic Federation
    is made up of 54 member corporations, and has 4401 capsular pilots in their ranks.
    They claim the regions of Immensea, Tenerifis, Impass, Omist and Feythabolis.
    They are close friends to Stain Empire, and work together with them for mutual
    defence."
