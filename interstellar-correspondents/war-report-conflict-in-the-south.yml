- body: "Wicked Creek, Scalding Pass, Detorid - for months now these southern regions
    have played host to a fierce conflict between two of the largest political entities
    in this area of space. On the offensive there is a coalition of alliances: Veritas
    Immortalis, Chimaera Pact, Knights Of the Southerncross and Lotka Volterra, allied
    originally by their common goal - the removal of the political and military behemoth
    that is the Red Alliance from the south-eastern regions of known space. \n\nPrior
    to the war this entire area, from the far corners of Cache down to the outer reaches
    Immensea, was controlled by Red Alliance; however this is no longer the case.
    Months of conflict have drastically changed the political landscape - following
    Veritas Immortalis\u2019 declaration of war in January, the aforementioned coalition
    has pushed this economic powerhouse back to the borders of Insmother. \n\nThe
    progress the coalition of alliances has made since the beginning of the war has
    been considerable: since the start of the conflict, over half of the Red Alliance\u2019s
    former sovereign space has been conquered. Some events, however, indicate that
    the progress has slowed markedly since the capture of Wicked Creek by the Knights
    Of the Southerncross, the most notable being the destruction of nine Red Alliance
    Dreadnoughts on the 8th of this month during an assault on Starbases owned by
    the Knights of the Southerncross in Q-GQHN - reportedly the greatest number of
    Capital Ships destroyed in any one engagement since these leviathans became available
    to pod pilots. \n\nMost pilots would imagine that a military achievement of this
    magnitude would swing the balance of power in the war more towards the aggressors;
    however, this does not appear to be the case here. The latest reports indicate
    very few systems on the frontline of the conflict have changed hands since February,
    leading any observer to question the reasons behind this seemingly sudden stalemate.
    \n\nThe situation is, however, more complicated than it first seems. Reports from
    Veritas Immortalis and Chimaera Pact leaders indicate that since the defence of
    Q-GQHN, Red Alliance has been fighting a guerrilla war, preferring to operate
    in hit-and-run squadrons whilst avoiding larger hostile fleets. This has forced
    the aggressing alliances to also change their tactics to that of a logistical
    war, system by system taking control of Red Alliance\u2019s space through the
    deployment of a large amount of Starbases - enough to ensure they will not lose
    the system without a fight. Operations such as these can be a tremendous logistical
    undertaking, and this is cited as the reason for the slow in the advancing forces."
