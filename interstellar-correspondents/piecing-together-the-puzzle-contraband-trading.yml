- body: "After several busy nights in the Nonni and Jita systems, where large quantities
    of contraband have changed hands, speculations grow as to who might be the driving
    force behind these purchases. Among the contraband obtained are drugs, slaves
    and DNA samples, giving new strength to suspicions about their use in a drastic
    new research project.   \n  \nSo far only two freelance traders, Kerio Ekoena
    and Leiara Xjenion have been positively identified as buyers, supposedly working
    for a third party corporation.   \n  \nRumours as to who this corporation is have
    begun to grow throughout the local population. Especially the presence of Jashira
    Ne\u2019rgha, an employee of Galactic Trading Logistics, whose presence on those
    nights has been noticed, suggesting some sort of involvement. It is believed that
    she has acted as a vendor of large quantities of contraband on several occasions,
    supplying millions of ISKs worth of her illegal goods.   \n  \nJashira Ne\u2019rgha
    has not been reachable for a comment and the continued refusal of a statement
    from CONCORD and the local police in Jita and Nonni, leaves the public to nothing
    more than rumours and speculations."
