    Bestowers, seemingly abandoned at the Narai III - Moon 1 - Ardishapur Family Bureau,
    were boarded yesterday by company officials after they received an anonymous tip
    off that there were people trapped on board without food or water. \n\nAfter they
    had forced entry, the station workers were horrified to discover scenes of immeasurable
    human suffering. Jaghard Fulgamon, the station manager, had this to say; \u201CThe
    stench was overpowering when our teams got on board. I have never seen such disgusting
    sights. People of all ages and gender crammed in together, without food or water,
    heat or light. All of them were showing signs of dehydration and starvation, and
    many had already died. Onboard one of the ships, the dead had been piled up in
    one cargo compartment, two hundred or so naked bodies in the final stages of emaciation.
    Our teams had to wear respirators and biohazard suits to enable them to do their
    work.\u201D \n\nThe ships were registered to Mastuk Rinmumi, a trader of poor
    reputation. When we contacted him, he had this to say: \u201CThese ships and their
    cargo no longer belong to me. I handed over ownership to Edophia Agmarn almost
    a week ago. How he treats his property is no concern of mine, although I am upset
    that he seems to have forgotten to re-register the ships. It means that I will
    undoubtedly be picking up the docking bay fees.\u201D \n\nWhen we spoke to Agmarn
    he revealed that the ships and the slaves on board were the winnings from a bet
    he had with Rinmuni, although he had refused to take them as payment. \u201CWe
    had a wager on the outcome of the Hydra Alliance versus Notoriety Alliance fight
    in the Alliance Championships. When Hydra won the match, Rinmuni was supposed
    to deliver ten thousand males, in good health and of good stock, to my compound
    in Boranai. He didn\u2019t deliver, and when I received a message telling me where
    they were, I sent one of my agents to inspect them. As you can see, he has not
    met his side of the wager, and I refuse to accept that the debt has been settled.
    This is not my property, and this is not my problem. Rinmuni still owes me my
    ten thousand males.\u201D \n\nUpon discovery, the station authorities immediately
    contacted the Servant Sisters of Eve, a humanitarian organisation with experience
    in providing disaster relief throughout New Eden. \u201CThis exemplifies everything
    that is wrong with the slave trade.\" Sister Herrie Tierremont spoke out. \"It
    is clear that these people have been kept in poor conditions before they were
    transported here. The victims have injuries caused by weeks and in some cases,
    years, of neglect.\u201D \u201CThey have been treated worse than animals. A full
    portfolio of these crimes against humanity has been prepared and I will be delivering
    it to the Theology Council. I understand that Slaving is legal in the Empire,
    but there are rules and regulations imposed by Amarrian Law. It is clear that
    these basic rules have not been met.\u201D She added that she hoped the survivors
    would be repatriated to the Minmatar Republic once they were fit enough to travel.
    \n\nA Theology Council spokesman promised they would look into the matter. \u201CIt
    is not for the Sisters of Eve to tell us what the Laws say. If the evidence is
    presented to us, we will investigate. The penalty for mistreating any of God\u2019s
    creatures is high. As Amarrians, it is our sacred duty to take care of the animals
    we are put in charge of.\u201D"
