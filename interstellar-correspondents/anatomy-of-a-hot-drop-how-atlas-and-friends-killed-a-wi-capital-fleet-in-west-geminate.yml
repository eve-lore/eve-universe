    Alliances. WI. eventually destroyed [the] tower, so he... and Securitas Protector
    [of Ihatalo Cartel Navy] formed a bait fleet composed of battleships with a few
    bait carriers.\"  \n  \n\"The bait fleet attacked the WI. control tower in AD-5B8
    [and] WI. cynoed in a capital and support fleet. Elo Knight then lit a cyno field
    and the ATLAS fleet jumped in. Tallitar in his Sabre held the WI. capitals long
    enough for most of the ATLAS support to get there... and the ATLAS fleet destroyed
    nearly all WI. capitals on the field for a... victory.\"  \n  \nWildly Inappropriate.
    Diplomat Meno Theaetetus said that his alliance \"did not see [this] coming\"
    but \"now that we know that ATLAS seems to be working under the instructions of
    these smaller alliances, we will not be making the same mistake again.\"  \n  \nElo
    Knight reports that other West Geminate Coalition ships were also present at the
    engagement \"but they were not aware of the impending capital fight.\" Asked to
    comment on his role in the West Geminate conflict, Elo Knight replied \"We are
    red to [the Coalition]. We just roam around and fight whoever we can. Black Legion
    is here to [fight] everyone.\"\n\n**Galnet References**\n\n[ATLAS Battle Records](http://killboard.atlas-alliance.com/?a=kill_battle&kll_id=125678&kll_times=2009-11-29
