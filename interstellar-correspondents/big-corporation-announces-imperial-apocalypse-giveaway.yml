- body: "In a surprising turn of events, the well-known BIG Corporation have announced
    that their bi-weekly lottery, long a staple in the EVE cluster, will be giving
    away an Imperial Apocalypse battleship as the main prize in the drawing of May
    24th.   \n  \nThe Imperial Apocalypse, long known to represent the pinnacle of
    Amarrian starship engineering, was reportedly donated to the corporation by Gallente
    holoreel actress Martina Monterneux. Says TornSoul, CEO of BIG: \u201CMartina
    approached us some time back because she had come into possession of the ship,
    but for reasons of her own wished to donate it to the world at large. What with
    herself being an avid, long-time participant in the BIG Lottery, she saw this
    as the perfect medium to accomplish that task.\u201D   \n  \nWhile no Imperial
    officials have been reached for comment, Amarrian Ambassador to Gallente Khifor
    Boraken released this statement at a press conference: \u201CAs should be common
    knowledge to everyone the Imperial Issue Apocalypse is not a mere trinket to be
    given away. It is one of the most advanced and deadly combat vessels in the history
    of the world, and it stands as a symbol of the Empire\u2019s achievement in the
    field. We do not currently have information as to how the actress came to be in
    possession of our ship, but rest assured we will find out.\u201D   \n  \nMartina
    Monterneux, sister of the late Gloria Monterneux, tragically killed in the Elarel
    Pleasure Gardens massacre last month, had this to say: \u201CThat ship was part
    of my sister\u2019s estate. It was bequeathed to me under her will with the full
    assent of Gallente law, and there is nothing in the world the Amarr can do about
    it.\u201D Questioned as to how her sister came to own the Imperial-issue battleship,
    Ms. Monterneux declined to comment.   \n  \nThe ship is being held by the BIG
    Corporation at an undisclosed location until the time of the drawing."
