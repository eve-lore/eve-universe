    has fallen into Atlas hands as internal strife comes to a head.  \n  \nThe capture
    came after a failed coup inside [RA]'s leadership caused a sovereignty loss in
    several capital constellations around Insmother. Aware of their opponent's difficulties,
    Atlas and allied forces exploited the confusion by launching a suprise attack
    deep inside Red Alliance's core systems.[![Former Red Alliance's Capitol Station
    in C-J6MT](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3147/racapitolthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F3147%2Fracapitol.png)
    \ \n  \nDuring the last several days, Red Alliance has lost at least five outposts
    in Insmother and two in Etherium Reach with more to follow. Cattie'Brie of [RA],
    paints a bleak picture: \"[It] is very difficult. We are surrounded and outnumbered
    and outgunned\".  \n  \nRed Alliance blames a coup attempt by ERROR [404] leadership
    for the difficulties they now face. According to Bapp R.U.S.H., CEO roles were
    stolen by ERROR and OMNYX members in a bid to achieve Red Alliance's executorship.
    However failing the revolt, renegade leaders were ultimately able to expel a key
    corporation from Red Alliance, resulting in half of its systems in Insmother losing
    the 'level 3' sovereignty status and the subsequent disruption of jump bridge
    operations.  \n  \nPresently, Red Alliance's former capitol station is controlled
    by Atlas and several Red Alliance ships may have been trapped within.  \n  \nGoonSwarm
    fleet members allegedly sent to help [RA]'s evacuation operations have been intercepted
    by Cult Of War [COW] capsuleers and subsequently obliterated using a doomsday
    device. Dah'Kanid describes the engagement: \"Unaware of the Titan threat from
    [COW], Goons jumped into the system [that had been] set up for [the ambush] and
    every single one [was killed]\".  \n  \nCult Of War Capsuleers have been helping
    Atlas and Allied forces by applying pressure on Red Alliance's western Flank.
    Endag Tanon, of [COW] explains that they have been engaging Red Alliance's fleet
    mostly in Scalding Pass. NeoNeTiC better clarifies his alliance's standings: \"Cult
    of War is what the name says - an alliance that wages war just because it appeals
    to its nature... We are here to lay waste to anything that moves and the current
    war ... [is] a nice moment to increase the scale of battle\".  \n  \nDespite Atlas
    and allies gaining the upper edge in Insmother, the war is far from over. NeoNeTiC
    offers his view on a possible future scenario: \"Politics are backstab-sensitive
    right now. This big anti-[RA] rush is unlikely to stand forever... people will
    begin to fight over the territory - amonst themselves if needed\". He also believes
    Goonswarm are not going to offer full scale help to Red Alliance as they currently
    have to recover from their efforts in Delve.  \n  \nCattie'Brie of [RA] believes
    his alliance could keep fighting, with Goonswarm or Northern Coalition help. However,
    he also admits: \"If there is no help we will fight until last [starbase]... then
    regroup somewhere in a safer [area].\"\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events
