    Domain** \\- Amarrian low-security based corporation Quantum Horizons [.ANZ.]
    has identified a thieving corporation member and executed him in his own 2 billion
    ISK Machariel.  \n  \nThe saga began when .ANZ. anchored a new control tower in
    a low-security system. Soon after, ships began disappearing from the Ship Maintenance
    Array including \"a Rook, a Dominix, 2 Scorpions, a Drake, a Noctis and several
    smaller tech 2 frigates\" according to CEO SuicidalPancake.  \n  \nSuicidalPancake
    explained that after two weeks, a trap was set using a Scorpion class battleship
    as bait. The theft of the Scorpion battleship was recorded at approximately 22:34
    on 8th of Feb.  \n  \nThe thief, identified as Bobby Byrde, was known to live
    an extravagant life. As SuicidalPancake tells us, \"Bobby was often seen flying
    highly expensive ships such as Machariels, Vindicators and Fleet Issue Tyhpoons,
    many fitted with faction and officer modules. It was well known within Quantum
    Horizons that Bobby's favourite ship was the Machariel, he often used it for hunting
    in low-sec.\"  \n  \nWith that knowledge in mind, a plan of punishment was drafted
    and a small low-sec roaming fleet was formed. Bobby \"was convinced that he should
    bring his Machariel, because it would be the scariest ship in the fleet\", said
    SuicidalPancake.  \n  \nHe explains how Bobby was taken care of: \"Instead of
    warping the fleet to the gate, I warped the fleet to a planet in the same direction
    as the gate. As the fleet dropped out of warp, Bobby's Machariel was targeted
    and destroyed.\"  \n  \nIn a press statement released shortly after the event,
    SuicidalPancake stated: \"Thieves are not tolerated within Quantum Horizons corp.
    Bobby has paid heavily for his crimes, but his loss should serve as an example
    to all thieves across New Eden; you WILL get caught.\"  \n  \nBobby Byrde was
    unavailable for comment regarding the event.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the
