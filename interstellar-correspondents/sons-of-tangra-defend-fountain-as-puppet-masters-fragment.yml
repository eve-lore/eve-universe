    \\- The recent Puppet Masters [PMS] assault on the Fountain region has come to
    a grinding halt in the face of heavy resistance from Fountain residents including
    Sons of Tangra [SOT] and elements of Pandemic Legion [PL].  \n  \nThe assault,
    staged from a beachhead in D4KU-5, saw the Puppet Masters make a bid for swathes
    of Fountain with support from Force of Evil alliance. An anonymous source has
    alleged that Puppet Masters were receiving support from KenZoku in the form of
    both control towers and tower armaments, though these allegations are unconfirmed.
    \ \n  \nDwight Hammerhead, speaking on behalf of Sons of Tangra alliance, believed
    that the turning point in the campaign came when PMS attempted to take sovereignty
    in the PNQY-Y system. Mr. Hammerhead claims that Puppet Masters \"...dropped a
    good deal of control towers, which were reported as stolen from our allies Arcane
    Alliance.\"  \n  \nConcerned at the prospect of a protracted campaign, Sons of
    Tangra leaders decided to commit the bulk of their forces to strike a decisive
    blow to PMS interests in Fountain. Captain Hammerhead stated \"0ren Ishii, a key
    director and primary target from Bulgarian Corporation [BULG] was quoted saying
    'I don't have time for lengthy and tedious POS warfare. This ends now.'\"  \n
    \ \n\"SOT and allied forces, including detachments from Pandemic Legion, moved
    into PNQY-Y and surrounding systems and began reinforcing towers,\" said Mr Hammerhead
    regarding SOT's counter attack. \"As losses started to mount, the numbers in PMS
    fleets slowly began to decline.\"  \n  \n\"Not counting minor skirmishes and roaming
    PMS gangs of ten to fifteen pilots, the fighting is effectively over,\" finished
    Dwight Hammerhead in his statement to the Interstellar Correspondents.  \n  \nThis
    end to large scale engagements has been confirmed by Arimathea Anthalas of Puppet
    Masters who tells us \"There are some small scale skirmishes in D4KU-5, YRNJ-8,
    and surrounds. [Puppet Masters] have not been defending any existing installations.\"\n\n###
    Puppet Masters Alliance Schisms\n\nAn initial statement by Arimathea Anthalas
    of Corp 1 Allstars described the removal of DAB corporation from PMS and the circumstances
    which led to less than amicable parting of ways.  \n  \n\"Apparently [DAB CEO]
    Aneu Angellus was unhappy with the direction of our alliance and how we chose
    to correct the problem. He is working on forming a new alliance. Reportedly he
    has basically the entire list of PMS corps minus NICE1 and GONZO\" said Arimathea
    in his original statement on GalNet.  \n  \nThe reaction to the perceived backroom
    dealings from other Puppet Masters leaders was swift. \"We kicked out DAB from
    the alliance this morning and closed Aneu's access to the forums to minimize damage.\"
    \ \n  \nAneu Angellus responded to Arimathea's version of events by citing a lack
    of coherent leadership in the alliance for why he felt it time to split from Puppet
    Masters. \"Arimathea has not been [active] for quite some time...\" and \"...C4w3
    [of Corp 1 Allstars] was meant to be the alliance leader, but bluntly did not
    step up to the plate.\"  \n  \nIn his response, Aneu claimed that \"Most of the...corporations
    in PMS are now leaving to join me on my venture - If they are wrong then no-one
    can be right in all of this.\"  \n   \nWhen asked if removing DAB reinforced the
    stability of PMS, Arimathea told us that \"Getting rid of Aneu was not an action
    to stabilise the alliance. [It] was damage control.\"  \n  \nSons of Tangra gave
    only a short response regarding PMS' leadership troubles \"I would refrain from
    commenting on the widely discussed capsuleer pilot Aneu Angellus and DAB Corporation.
    Whatever internal problems the PMS leadership was experiencing eventually led
    to the complete breakdown of their offensive,\" stated Dwight Hammerhead.  \n
    \ \nIn the wake of the stalled assault and internal strife, Arimathea Anthalas
    confirms that many member corporations have since decided to leave Puppet Masters.
    \"It's hard to say who followed Aneu and who didn't. That's for Aneu to confirm
    or deny. We wish all corps who either followed him or went separate ways the best
    of luck despite some of the challenges we had in working together.\"  \n  \nAneu
    Angellus has so far been unavailable for comment. \n\n### Galnet Resources:\n\n[[Puppet
