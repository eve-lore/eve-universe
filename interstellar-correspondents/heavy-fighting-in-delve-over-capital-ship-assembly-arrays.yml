- body: "**8WA-Z6, Delve** \\- The battle for Delve blossomed to epic proportions
    over the course of 12.02.111. Many of the control towers necessary for holding
    sovereignty claims fell, supercapitals were slain both in space and in construction
    and system sovereignties changed hands.\n\nTerritory-grade sovereignty in most
    of Delve is currently held by KenZoku. Under its previous registration as Band
    of Brothers, the corporations currently comprising KenZoku held Province and,
    in some systems, Constellation Capital claims on the region's ownership which
    have left many structures anchored - such as capital ship assembly arrays - that
    cannot currently be operated. These arrays are currently under attack by a coalition
    of KenZoku's enemies apparently seeking to cripple the alliance's supercapital
    production capability before it can be restored.\n\nThe Campaign Records of the
    factions involved show the following approximate coalitions of forces:\n\nDefending
    Delve against the invading forces are KenZoku, [their allies](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.eveonline.com%2Fwiki%2FGBC)
    and a force from Against ALL Authorities.\n\nThe invading forces comprise GoonSwarm
    and their allies, Morsus Mihi and RAZOR Alliance of the [Northern Coalition](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.eveonline.com%2Fwiki%2FNorthern_Coalition),
    Pandemic Legion and Sons of Tangra from Fountain, B.L.A.C.K. and KIA Alliance.\n\nMeanwhile,
    GoonSwarm's campaign records show their home territory under attack by forces
    from Against ALL Authorities, RED.OverLord, Stain Empire, C0ven and Systematic-Chaos;
    it is not yet confirmed whether this is an organized coalition of forces or simply
    separate groups attacking a common target. More detail will be forthcoming in
    follow-up articles.  \n  \nZenith Affinity also managed to seize the sovereignty
    of 3-LJW3 in Detorid from KenZoku.\n\n### KenZoku Towers Fall  \n\n\nOn the 11.02.111,
    in OGY-6D, Northern Coalition forces destroyed a [FinFleet Dark Blood Control
    Tower](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.northern-coalition.com%2F%3Fa%3Dkill_detail%26kll_id%3D359403),
    causing KenZoku to lose their claim upon the system today.\n\nIn a statement recorded
    on the now-public Band of Brothers directorial forums, Darius JOHNSON of Goonswarm
    allegedly announced that [Goonswarm will no longer be defending their old home
    systems](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bandofbrothers.org.uk%2Fforum%2Fshowthread.php%3Fp%3D1395063%23post1395063),
    abandoning them so they can push with everything towards the conquest of Delve.\n\nGoonswarm's
    attacks have so far focused on three systems: J-LPX7, 5-6QW7 and QY6-RK, felling
    8 large control towers and two Capital Ship Assembly Arrays in 24 hours according
    to their combat records:\n\n03:35 - QY6-RK - Amarr Control Tower - Reikoku  \n04:29
    - QY6-RK - Amarr Control Tower - Reikoku  \n04:52 - QY6-RK - Gallente Control
    Tower - Reikoku  \n05:15 - QY6-RK - Amarr Control Tower - Reikoku  \n13:53 - QY6-RK
    - Amarr Control Tower - Evolution  \n14:44 - 5-6QW7 - Caldari Control Tower -
    Black Eclipse Corp  \n15:42 - J-LPX7 - Dark Blood Control Tower - Relentless Construction
    \ \n17:14 - J-LPX7 - Dark Blood Control Tower - Reikoku\n\nTrzzbk of GoonSwarm
    issued the following statement about today's fighting:\n\n\"Today GoonSwarm successfully
    quashed a KenZoku counter-offensive in Delve. GS and allied forces over the course
    of the day destroyed two CSAAs, with another KenZoku tower with CSAAs coming out
    later tonight. We also killed at least 7 carriers, one dread, an Aeon mothership
    and an Avatar titan.\n\n\"GoonSwarm received intelligence earlier this week that
    KenZoku, along with their allies [Against ALL Authorities] and their assorted
    pets were going to make a massive stand against the [GoonSwarm] offensive in Delve
    in today. We rallied massive forces between [GoonSwarm], [Pandemic Legion], [Tau
    Ceti Federation] and our other allies and successfully defeated their attempted
    defense and we are now on track to take [sovereignty] in at least four of KenZoku's
    outpost systems.\n\n\"Today was, shall we say, favorable to GoonSwarm.\"\n\nTobruk
    of Pandemic Legion claims that today's operations by KenZoku were [classed by
    its leaders as a \"Red Pen\" operation](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmyeve.eve-online.com%2Fingameboard.asp%3Fa%3Dtopic%26threadID%3D997625%26page%3D1%2320),
    an all-out effort in which the defenders would bring everything they could to
    bear. A KenZoku spokesman could not be reached to confirm or deny this claim prior
    to publication.\n\nAs well as working with GoonSwarm on the tower demolitions
    between 13:53 and 17:14, Pandemic Legion's campaign record shows another 3 tower
    kills the same day:\n\n17:44 - MJXW-P - Amarr Control Tower (Small) - Constructive
    Influence  \n19:13 - MJXW-P - Amarr Control Tower (Small) - Destructive Influence
    \ \n21:12 - MJXW-P - Amarr Control Tower (Small) - FREE GATES / Skunk-Works\n\n###
    Supercapital Casualties  \n\n\nAs well as the towers themselves, where capital
    assembly arrays were anchored at the towers, these were destroyed - GoonSwarm
    claim that two have been torn down so far.\n\nDianabolic, CEO of Reikoku, stated
    that the capital ship assembly array at the Relentless Construction tower destroyed
    in J-LPX7 was [building a Nyx](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmyeve.eve-online.com%2Fingameboard.asp%3Fa%3Dtopic%26threadID%3D996346)
    mothership, which would only have been 2 days from the end of its cycle if sovereignty
    could be restored. [Goonswarm members heatedly deny this](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmyeve.eve-online.com%2Fingameboard.asp%3Fa%3Dtopic%26threadID%3D996346%26page%3D1%2317),
    citing a post from the publicised [Band of Brothers directors' forums](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bandofbrothers.org.uk%2Fforum%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D35861)
    but there is much dispute about possible interpretations of this document.\n\nAlso
    lost in the defence efforts were an [Aeon mothership](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.killboard.net%2Fplayer%2FWaagaa%2520Ktlehr%2Fkills%2Fpage_0%2F)
    belonging to Waagaa Ktlehr in J-LPX7 and an [Avatar-class Titan](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.killboard.net%2Fdetails%2F304886%2F)
    belonging to Shrike that [perished outside a control tower's shields](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Figbd%2Figbd.php%3Ffaction%3Dic%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fimg6.imageshack.us%252Fimg6%252F6418%252Fdeadagainwa5.jpg)
    in 8WA-Z6. While this is Shrike's fourth loss of an Avatar on the Band of Brothers/KenZoku
    killboard, she has claimed [almost 2,500 ship kills](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.killboard.net%2Fplayer%2FShrike%2F)
    with her titans in her time in Evolution.\n\n### Goonswarm Towers Fall  \n\n\nWhile
    all of GoonSwarm's forces were engaged in Delve, however, Against ALL Authorities,
    C0ven, Stain Empire, RED.OverLord and Systematic-Chaos attacked sovereignty-claiming
    towers in the Feythabolis and Esoteria regions GoonSwarm claim to have abandoned
    in favour of conquering Delve. GoonSwarm's campaign records show that 17 towers
    and a cyno-jammer fell to these attacks in the course of 24 hours:\n\n01:02 -
    DB1R-4 - Minmatar Control Tower - Ars Ex Discordia  \n01:48 - ZS-2LT - Minmatar
    Control Tower - Ultrapolite Socialites  \n02:26 - ZS-2LT - Domination Control
    Tower - Ultrapolite Socialites  \n03:04 - ZS-2LT - Minmatar Control Tower - Ultrapolite
    Socialites  \n03:42 - ZS-2LT - Minmatar Control Tower - Ars Ex Discordia  \n08:58
    - GHZ-SJ - Amarr Control Tower - GoonFleet  \n09:18 - QS-530 - Gallente Control
    Tower (Small) - Ars Ex Discordia  \n09:32 - GHZ-SJ - Amarr Control Tower - GoonFleet
    \ \n09:56 - PE-H02 - True Sansha Control Tower - GoonFleet  \n10:15 - GHZ-SJ -
    Amarr Control Tower - GoonFleet  \n10:25 - PE-H02 - Amarr Control Tower - GoonFleet
    \ \n10:43 - PE-H02 - True Sansha Control Tower - GoonFleet  \n10:47 - PE-H02 -
    CynoJammer  \n10:48 - OXC-UL - Gallente Control Tower (Small) - Ars Ex Discordia
    \ \n10:51 - GHZ-SJ - Amarr Control Tower - GoonFleet  \n13:27 - BJD4-E - Minmatar
    Control Tower (Small) - GoonFleet  \n13:50 - GHZ-SJ - Amarr Control Tower - GoonFleet
    \ \n14:35 - GHZ-SJ - Amarr Control Tower - GoonFleet\n\nIn recent days, destruction
    and anchoring of towers in key Delve systems has continued. Several outposts are
    poised to fall to the combined forces of GoonSwarm, Pandemic Legion, the Northern
    Coalition and their allies. The main KenZoku force is currently pinned down in
    stations in PR-8CA, with over 400 pilots in the system even during lulls in the
    fighting, so the defenders are forced to sally in periodic breakout fleets.\n\nShortly,
    the Interstellar Correspondents will be providing in-depth reports on the sovereignty
    situation in Delve, and an interview with Haargoth Agamar, the former Black Nova
    Corp director who defected to GoonSwarm.\n\n### GalNet Resources\n\n[11.02.111
