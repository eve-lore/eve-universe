- body: "Mr Frantian Brinor has been a long term employee at Perkone, managing warehouse
    storage and manufacturing processes for many years. Though sadly as was found
    out last night, as the body recovered from his ships wreckage was identified as
    him, he had lead not just Perkone, but everyone astray. He has been positively
    identified as the man behind the mysterious ships that have been plaguing most
    of The Forge for nearly two months now, causing innumerable deaths. A man who
    has lied to countless citizens and stolen equipment whose value was greatly in
    excess of his own wealth. Last night however his scheme came tumbling down.   \n
    \ \nA high ranking official for Perkone opened a secure communication link with
    zarig in the early hours of yesterday evening. Zarig was already known as affiliate
    of Mr Kyogen Steiner, a pilot the Perkone official keeps him in high regard because
    of his heavy involvement in countering the mysterious pilots over the last few
    weeks. He was quick to disclose where Mr Brinor was heading, at the time unsure
    what he was doing, but with suspicions that it might be somehow connection to
    the mysterious vessels. To compound their suspicions, it was also mentioned that
    their internal records indicated that, many different types of equipment, ships
    and munitions had gone missing from the Uemon Factory. Only a high ranking officer
    could remove items and cover it up without leaving a trace. Mr Brinor fitted this
    description perfectly.   \n  \nMr Brinor was quickly intercepted by a large capsuleer
    fleet, who were quick to notice that he was accompanied by four pilots from the
    Caldari Business Tribunal and that all of them were wanted for the acts of piracy
    that had so plagued the forge. Communications beforehand in the Paala system already
    made it plain to all those watching that Mr Brinor was in command of these pilots
    and that when confronted with the fleet, also appeared very authoritarian in the
    way in which they spoke to him. This provided the fleet with enough intelligence
    to take action against them.   \n  \nIt seems after all the confusion over what
    truly has been going on, that neither CBT nor Perkone are to blame. This group
    of loyal citizens, who are named below, have stood up above all others, to seek
    out the truth and reveal the lies, which this man has tried to hide for so long.
    \  \n  \nMr Kyogen Steiner (For his intellect in understanding and coming to reveal
    the truth behind the actions of the Mysterious ships.)   \n  \nMrs Helpdesk (For
    supporting Mr Steiner in making his accusations public to Perkone.)   \n  \nzarig
    (For asking enough questions to unwind anything else that may have been going
    on behind the scenes when he was contacted and ultimately, to carry out the actions
    that would seal the fate of Frantian Brinor.)   \n  \nAll those pilots that helped
    to assist in the death of Frantian Brinor and the Mysterious ships (Now known
    from bodies recovered to be experts in covert operations, hired by Mr Brinor for
    the acts that he coordinated and eventually committed), cannot be thanked enough
    for their loyalty and speed in bringing Mr Brinor to justice.   \n  \nThose that
    have been working day and night on trying to crack the code, which the mysterious
    pilots spoke in.   \n  \nMr Brinor is thought to have supplied the ships to the
    mercenaries in Paala, through the convoy that was sent out nearly two months ago,
    and at that point gave them their strict orders on who to attack and how to go
    about it. Mr Brinor\u2019s motives for these radical actions may always remain
    a secret, but now at least the State and its pilots can remain safe in the knowledge
    that they will not be attacked at random by these dangerous pilots ever again."
