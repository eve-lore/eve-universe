- body: "Once again the time for words is coming to an end and the guns will soon
    do the talking. The Fifth Alliance Tournament is just around the corner - coming
    to your GalNet viewer at the end of this month. \n\nThe organisers and event staff
    are currently hard at work, planning transit logistics and constructing the purpose
    built arenas. In amongst this busy schedule they had to find the time to arrange
    the battle schedule, which has just been announced. \n\nIn typical tournament
    tradition, selected members of staff were invited to pick names at random from
    a list of competitors in order to form the group lists. Rumors that the device
    used was called 'Ragnar's Hat' have not been substantiated. \n\nThe full schedule
    and group lists are now available on the official GalNet pages. \n\nIn related
    news, prizes for the tournament have not yet been officially announced, however
    there are rumors that several factions, including a number of pirate groups, will
    be sponsoring teams in a similar fashion to the last tournament. More news on
    that as it becomes available. \n\n_External GalNet References_  \n[The Official
