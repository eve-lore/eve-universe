- body: "Triumvirate, last year's runner up at the Alliance Tournament, have announced
    that they will not be taking up the slot set aside for them at this year's competition.
    The reluctant decision to withdraw by the member corporations follows what has
    been a difficult time for Triumvirate.\n\n[![The Alliance Tournament Poster](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2682/alliance-tournament-posterthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F2682%2Falliance-tournament-poster.png)\n\nDarknesss,
    a pilot within Triumvirate, commented: _\"Unfortunately an alliance like TRI does
    not fit in the political landscape of today's EVE, we like to work mostly alone,
    and prefer skill over quantity, but it's become a 2 sided game in 0.0.\"_ He went
    further to explain: _\"Now there are pretty much 2 sides in 0.0, if you attack
    any entity they have multiple entities to call to their aid. Triumvirate may come
    back when that landscape changes, and if there are opportunities for an alliance
    of our style to grab._ _A lot of us were really looking forward to [the tournament],
    but there is always next year.\"_\n\n_Mitthrawn Uruodo, a member of the Ev0ke
    team that won last year, commented: _\"I don't think the Triumvirate from today
    is the same from last year. - [but it] would have been nice to see and fight them
    again.\"_  _\n\nNo doubt vast numbers of spectators, gamblers, and participants
    of the tournament will be disappointed by Triumvirate's decision not to return
    for a shot at first place. They can still at least take away a glimmer of hope
    that they may yet return next year, at full strength.\n\nExternal GalNet Resources\n\n[Alliance
