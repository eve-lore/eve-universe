- body: "YC 113.07.01 - YC 113.07.31\n\nThis month saw elements of the DRF, primarily
    NC., Pandemic Legion and Raiden launch an attack on the Goonswarm Federation home
    region, Deklein. The primary goal is believed to have been to acquire a grasp
    on as many technetium rich moons as possible due to their immense income potential.
    The initial launch of the campaign saw limited success; however the attackers
    were rapidly repelled. This conflict saw Deklein increase in terms of numbers
    of vessels destroyed from 4,529 in June to 8,390 in July.  \n  \nMore capsuleer
    alliances have been moving to the Delve region, where a great deal of instability
    has created an almost \"free for all\" style situation, with 16,168 capsuleer
    vessels being destroyed this month. The two largest participants in this were
    the allies Morsus Mihi and Brick Squad, with Morsus Mihi destroying 3,896 vessels
    and losing 3,057 and Brick Squad destroying 2,369 and losing 2,265. 71 territorial
    claim units were also destroyed, indicating substantial territorial disputes.
    \ \n  \nThis month DED has declassified the names of the ten alliances who struck
    the most final blows against capsuleer vessels from the beginning of Y110 to the
    end of this month. For the purpose of this report they excluded any losses of
    shuttles, capsules or rookie vessels. They are as follows;  \n  \n<table>  \n<tr>
