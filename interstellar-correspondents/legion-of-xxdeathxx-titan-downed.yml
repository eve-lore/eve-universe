    Pass** \\- On Monday 08.06.111, a Legion of xXDEATHXx [XIX] Titan was downed by
    Atlas capsuleers working in concert with pilots from Krautbreak, Minor Threat
    and Cult of War, collectively known as \"Curse Coaliton.\" The kill occurred after
    several hours of heated battle during which both fleets tried to gain tactical
    control of the 1V-LI2 solar system,  [official reports](http://www.scrapheap-challenge.com/viewtopic.php?p=873760&sid=5e4828fb427d99fa6b7c001ed2fa1fea#873760)
    confirmed.  \n  \n[![GAYVER7's Avatar Going Down](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3123/avadownthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F3123%2Favadown.png)The
    contested space represents an important logistics node for [XIX] and a thorough
    defence had been planned: [XIX] fleeted five titans, set up a cyno jammer and
    requested reinforcement from Red Alliance [RA] capsuleers. While it is alleged
    that they also called for support from Against ALL Authorities, none was provided,
    with their [killboard showing forces engaged elsewhere](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.a-kills.com%2Frelated.php%3Fid%3D255107).
    \ \n  \nAt the beginning of the clash, Atlas first priority was to incapacitate
    the cyno jammer in order to bring a capital fleet inside 1V-LI2.  \n  \nFollowing
    Atlas' attack [XIX]'s capsuleers scrambled to defend the jammer with all means
    available. Bobby Atlas recalls the battle: \"Titans were [showing up] about 5-10
    minutes apart and firing doomsdays solo... [they weren't] coordinated effectively,
    allowing us to down the jammer with minimal losses\".   \n  \nAs soon as the jammer
    went down, Atlas jumped his capital fleet inside 1V-LI2 while XIX's titans took
    cover, but a spy was already lurking inside the Red Alliance fleet.  \n  \nDah'kanid
    of Atlas explains that when [XIX] and Red Alliance joined the fleet, a spy within
    the [RA] fleet realized he had information giving away the position of GAYVER7's
    Avatar.  \n  \nAtlas' Fleet Commander tells us: \"[Our spy] takes a squad commander
    position and invites our [heavy interdictors] ... [we] land, tackle and aggro
    the Titan ... our entire fleet warps on him\".   \n  \nThe Avatar was destroyed
    in few minutes of intense fire.  \n  \nThe war in Detorid is not over. While Atlas'
    CEO claims he is satisfied with their current progress and momentum, [XIX] and
    allies will likely continue to put up a vigorous fight.  \n  \nThe Interstellar
    Correspondents attempted to contact representatives from XIX but none were avilable
    prior to publication. Our reporters will continue to monitor the situation and
    bring you updates as they arise.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in
