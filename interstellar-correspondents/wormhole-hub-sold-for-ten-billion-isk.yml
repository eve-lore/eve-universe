    Comfort Alliance [COMFY] claims they have sold the location and intelligence of
    a wormhole system they had based out of until recently for 10 billion ISK. In
    a GalNet release, the alliance states, \"The buyer [received] all the intelligence
    we have on the system, what tends to [reside] there, how the encounters work,
    etc.\"  \n  \nThe release outlined how Total Comfort Alliance spent a significant
    amount of time and effort seeking a suitable wormhole system. The wormhole they
    eventually chose as their base of operations was a Class 4* wormhole they named
    'New Thelan'. Total Comfort expeditionary forces adopted the name in memory of
    Thelan, their former home in known space. Total Comfort believed their new base
    to be invaluable due to its consistent 16 hour cycle of openings to Class 3* wormhole
    space, which in turn opened up into standard shipping lanes. Anopheli, of Pillowsoft
    [PILLO], a member corporation of Total Comfort which lead the expedition, remarked:
    \"The unique aspect of New Thelan was that it would only [lead to] C247 wormholes
    within the system, observed over the two weeks we were in [New Thelan].\" This
    reliable access allows the fast transport of goods into and out of 'New Thelan'.
    \ \n  \nThe press release went on to state that Total Comfort desired to pursue
    a more lucrative course of business and decided to sell their stake in the system
    by auctioning off their base. Since solar systems cannot currently be 'purchased',
    Total Comfort put the intelligence, (including specifics pertaining to logistics
    and tactical specifications), up for auction. CEO Nyphur of Pillowsoft, in a recent
    interview stated, \"There was also a no-risk guarantee, that if the system didn't
    perform as advertised, we'd refund the entire sale price within the first two
    weeks.\" A buyout offer was made soon after bidding began, and the board of directors
    of Total Comfort accepted the bid with an overwhelming majority vote.  \n  \nNyphur,
    who handled the auction said, \"...the buyers will most certainly make more than
    the 10 [billion ISK] they paid within the next [quarter], I'm still as shocked
    as anyone that it sold for that much.\" The corporation who placed the winning
    bid wishes to remain anonymous, but was willing to participate in a joint interview
    with Nyphur. In that interview, they confirmed the sale and furthermore stated,
    \"I would like to add that it was a pleasure to do business with Nyphur, [he's
    a] very truthworthy individual, which unfortunately is hard to find in the universe
    at times\".\n\n*classification is an unofficial system in use by many pod pilots
