    to Sev3rance [-7-] ran into trouble early this morning when it warped into a trap
    set by Cry Havoc [C H] on the Dital gate.   \n  \nCry Havoc reports that a Curatores
    Veritas Alliance [CVA] rescue fleet attempted to intervene but did not arrive
    in time to save the doomed titan from C H's battleship fleet. The final blow was
    recorded at 04:42 this morning.  \n  \nAccording to Mistress Suffering of C H,
    a forward group of HAC's was originally sent to the area in an attempt to lure
    Sev3rance into deploying the month-old titan. The ploy worked and the titan piloted
    by Gelo Breen was soon on its way to the gate, accompanied by a small support
    fleet.   \n  \nUpon landing, the titan activated its doomsday weapon and cloaked.
    It was soon decloaked and tackled, however, according to C H who immediately recalled
    their battleship fleet from the immediate area. Breen estimates that within 5-10
    minutes, Cry Havoc had around sixty battleships on the field.  \n  \nThe decision
    to deploy the titan was made by Breen who acted on clear scouting reports from
    the surrounding systems. He stated, however, that he \"had a gut feeling it was
    a trap\u2026\" His suspicion was confirmed as soon as he came out of warp.  \n
    \ \n\"[I] instantly knew it was a trap at warp-in,\" Breen recalls. \"They had
    warp-in locations all around the gate. They had been making them with corporation
    not hostile in Providence which is always the drawback of running a 'Not Red Don't
    Shoot' policy.\"  \n  \nThe seeming impotence of the Leviathan's DD can be attributed
    to C H's calculated use of kinetic resistance.  \n  \nCry Havoc was also assisted
    by eight battleships from Honour Bound, a corporation formerly aligned with Sc0rched
    Earth who Breen recalls doomsdaying just weeks prior to this engagement.\n\n###
