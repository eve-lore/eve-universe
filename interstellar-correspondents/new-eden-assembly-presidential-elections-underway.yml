    Eden Assembly's first presidential election is currently underway.  \n  \nThe
    NEA, formed this past August, is lead by Benjamin Shepherd and has been described
    as \"a union of capsuleers from all empires and organizations, discussing and

    high profile capsuleers incuding Elsebeth Rhiannon & several members of Moira.
    \ \n  \nThe new initiative allows every capsuleer the opportunity to voice an
    opinion within the assembly. It has gained some support within the GalNet community,
    with comments from capsuleers such as John revenent; \"I have high hopes for this
    initiative, a capsuleer can accomplish much during times of war and turmoil, think
    of what we can be capable of in a time of peace and prosperity.\"  \n  \nAlthough
    the NEA has been established to discuss interstellar matters, the organization
    holds no power over members or member organizations, and Elsebeth Rhiannon made
    a public statement in which she described the NEA as nothing more than \"an interstellar
    debate club\", concluding that the NEA would hold no authority over herself as
    an individual or any groups that she is associated with: \"NEA absolutely holds
    no authority over my clan, corporation, alliance, or other organization I represent.
    My goal as a NEA councillor is neither to promote the interests of those organizations
    nor to seek peace with the known hostiles also on the council. It is simply to
    serve as one of the people facilitating open, free, safe, and respectful (as much
    as possible) communications between capsuleers of various factions.\"  \n  \nThe
    voting for president of the NEA will run for two weeks and ends October 21st YC112.\n\n###
