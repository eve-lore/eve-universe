    Dreams was a founding corporation of Curatores Veritatis Alliance [CVA], a well
    knownAmarr loyalist alliance that operates under NRDS (Not Red Don't Shoot) rules
    even in nullsec.  \n\n \n\nMany of the pilots who fly with Imperial Dreams  want
    a sense of purpose; \"Violence should always have a reason\" is the philosophy
    that was inherited from the corporation's founder Aralis.\n\n \n\nAs capsuleers
    who align themselves with the holy Amarr empire, CVA carved out a piece of space
    in Providence (which is situated directly below the Amarr empire) where neutrals
    could operate freely. With a primary base located at X6AB-Y V - \"Aralis Immortalis\"
    and 12 years of existence, the corporation is in no danger of dissolution.\n\n
    \n\nThe corporation recently had their peaceful celebration disrupted by a 100-ship
    Drifter fleet which destroyed many of the attending capsuleers' ships before themselves
    being destroyed. Prior to the attack, Trisha D'Vaney, the CEO of Imperial Dreams
    had stated; \"The goal of the celebration, which is in direct response to the
    Empress' recent statement for Amarr unity, is to bring the many groups that support
    Amarr justice together. Imperial Dreams has also sent a formal request to Admiral
    \ Ren Karetta to provide security for the event due to concerns about the Drifter
    armada\". Those concerns were borne out by the course of events.\n\n \n\nWith
    a need for more capsuleers on the front lines Imperial Dreams is recruiting and
    will take any capsuleer with a valid pilot's licence. Growth in a capsuleer's
    career and knowledge base after joining Imperial Dreams is almost assured.\n\n
    \ \nTo have your corporation highlighted in this segment contact ISD Jarrett Pelley
    with your celebrations and events."
