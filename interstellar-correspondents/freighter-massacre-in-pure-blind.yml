    EC-P8R, Pure Blind** \u2013 On 03.09.113, the Fuzzy Logec alliance lost a convoy
    of freighters full of capital ship construction equipment to a permutation of
    an old scam by Goonswarm Federation.   \n  \nWeeks ago Fuzzy Logec CEO Nekumi
    negotiated with Akara Ito of the Goonswarm Federation and believed that she had
    \"bought 3JN9-Q, O-2RNZ and AGG-NR\u201D for 30bn ISK and an agreement to supply
    Goonswarm with a number of capital ships per month.   \n  \nGoonswarm had even
    offered Nekumi an escort fleet to keep Fuzzy Logec's capital production equipment
    secure. Fuzzy Logec jumped into EC-P8R from Torrinos, where they were met by their
    \"escort\" and summarily destroyed. Referencing an alleged lack of discipline
    in Goonswarm fleets, Akara Ito noted that \u201CEverybody remembered not to shoot
    the first neutral appearing and we held our fire until the very last freighter
    was trapped.\u201D Nekumi estimated Fuzzy Logec's losses at 8 freighters and 2
    Orcas, all full of equipment.   \n  \nAfter the rout, Akara claimed that Goonswarm
    faced an internal issue, with pilots dropping from the fleet to loot wrecks away
    from the eyes of their FC. Facing this insubordination, Akara Ito says \"blues
    were shot at.\" While some pilots still managed to loot and escape unlogged, Akara
    notes two Chimera BPOs as some of the higher value items captured.   \n  \nNekumi
    said she knew very well of Goonswarm\u2019s reputation but believed the deal to
    be fair. Her alliance is still seeking an agreement for ownership of a few nullsec
    systems, saying \u201CIf [anyone] needs an alliance who build caps (if they\u2019re
    used to kill Goons, they're cheaper), we just need a few nice quiet systems.\u201D
    \  \n  \nAkara Ito commented \u201CI'd sell systems anytime.\u201D \n\n* * *\n\nAre
