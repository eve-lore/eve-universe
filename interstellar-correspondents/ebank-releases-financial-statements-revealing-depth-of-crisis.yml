    released yesterday Ray McCormack, chairman of EBANK, announced the astonishing
    news that the organisation currently has a deficit of 1.2 trillion ISK. Furthermore,
    to maintain the stability of the bank they are suspending withdrawals, and interest
    payments, on all accounts held with them until such time as the bank's balance
    sheet is restored to strength.  \n  \nWhen asked how long it might take until
    normal service resumes, Ray McCormack commented: _\"we're aiming for a year.\"_
    The magnitude of the task ahead can be seen in the bank's financial statement,
    which reports their assets to be worth an estimated 884 billion ISK, while its
    liabilities exceed 1.9 trillion ISK. The reasons for the largest losses in ISK
    have been revealed in the statement as:\n\n  * 250 billion ISK - Embezzled by
    Ricdic\n  * 275 billion ISK - Default on loan arranged by Ricdic\n  * 75 billion
    ISK - EBANK Salaries\n  * 36 billion ISK - Share Default Freelancers Inc. Research
    Division\n  * 35.9 billion ISK - Loan Default\n\n\n\nIn addition to the account
    suspensions the bank also plans to begin an aggressive policy to recover ISK lost
    from those who have defaulted on their loan agreements. Any party that fails to
    come to an equitable arrangement with EBANK could find themselves named in public,
    an act that will surely damage permanently their future business prospects. Based
    upon Ray McCormack's estimation, 150 billion ISK of the 257 billion ISK loan book
    is made up of toxic debt. It appears that the recovery process for EBANK will
    be a difficult and lengthy one.  \n  \nThis recent shock has only confirmed one
    ex EBANK customer's view of banking institutions in New Eden: _\"Well, I think
    these [types] of things are basically time bombs. With that much on the line and
    so many things that can go wrong ... it's a disaster waiting to happen._ \" Adding:
    _\"It's been proven that the risk is too high for what you get out of it.\"_  \n
    \ \nAnother ex-customer of EBANK added their own reaction to the statement: _\"I
    feel extremely bad for the people that have had their accounts \"frozen\" and
    I don't think Ebank is going about repairing things in an ideal way.\"_  \n  \nAs
    and when more information comes to light on Ebank's financial situation, follow-up
    reports will be published by the Interstellar Correspondents.\n\n \n\n**Related
