- body: "Last week, the Takamatsu Trading Exchange set up its first starbase in the
    Obe system. The massive Charon freighter \u201CTakamatsu\u201D set sail from the
    DED Testing Facilities, along with her three Bustard tenders, and set up its first
    TAKA starbase. \n\n\u201CToday is a wonderful day for the Takamatsu Exchange,\u201D
    said Masaki Takamatsu, CEO of the Takamatsu Trading Exchange, \u201Cwith this
    starbase we begin to expand our influence outside of the local stations, and in
    particular avoid the state's station fees.\u201D While the exact location is not
    known, Masaki Takamatsu assured his shareholders that the starbase is equipped
    with two dozen electronic warfare modules and will withstand any but the strongest
    assault. \n\nThis announcement follows the recent trials of the Takamatsu corporation
    in the Jita, Kisogo, and Sobaseki systems, where they amassed millions of units
    of garbage and annoyed station managers to no end. \u201CWe made a mistake,\u201D
    says Masaki, \u201Cin assuming that station managers would be more tolerant towards
    millions of units of garbage in their hangers. In retrospect it was a bad idea.\u201D
    \n\nThe fate of the garbage remains unknown, but several market analysts have
    speculated that this new starbase is simply a front for disposing of the garbage.
    If that is the case, the Takamatsu corporation may face civil charges of pollution
    and obstruction of justice. \n\nThe Obe system has been a site of contentious
    warfare for a decade now, starting with the Gurista raids that ushered in the
    development of the Navy Raven, followed by internicine warfare between pod pilot
    groups, and now this latest development. When asked if he feared hostile forces
    near his starbase, Masaki replied, \"Never. We're on a contract with the Caldari
    Navy, delivering garbage. Who'd want to obstruct that?\""
