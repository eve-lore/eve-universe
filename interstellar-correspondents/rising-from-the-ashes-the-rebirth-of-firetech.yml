- body: "Eurgrana - The fires of reformation are dying down, the embers are dwindling
    and the ashes are settling. FireTech have been reborn. \n\nFormed in the year
    107, FireTech have most recently been flying under the banner of the Pure. Alliance.
    The current trend in New Eden is for pilots and corporations to seek out alliances
    to join in order to gain access to territories, infrastructure and protection.
    FireTech have now decided to be the exception to this rule and have decided to
    leave Pure. and strike out on their own. \n\nAs of the twenty-eighth day of March,
    FireTech have relocated their Head Quarters to the Sebiestor tribe academy station
    located near Eurgrana VIII and have separated from Pure. \n\nIn celebration of
    this new beginning they are holding a recruitment drive to welcome new pilots
    into what BLACKoKNIGHT describes as the \"Fiery Abyss.\" \n\nDuring this event
    \"FireTech will re-affirm its commitment to its pilots... always encouraging the
    core FireTech values of team participation and comradery. The corp strives to
    be a place where you can be assured that if you are in trouble your corpmates
    are already in warp to you.\" \n\nThis sentiment is echoed by Captain Feiko who
    describes FireTech in three words: \"Pride, Loyalty, Brotherhood.\" \n\n\"We realise
    the only way to [find success in New Eden] is to have strength in all fields,
    and our strength comes from our strong bond to the welfare of fellow corpmates\"
    he explains. \n\n\"We have very exciting times ahead, and we will accomodate almost
    any new recruit, and give them the time that is required to adjust to our fast
    paced expansion.\" \n\nWe have been informed that during this latest recruitment
    drive everyone is invited to visit Eurgrana to participate in the rebirth and
    join in the activities. \n\nPilots are invited to join the In-Capsule Communication
    Channel \"-FT-\" for further information on corporate applications and events.
