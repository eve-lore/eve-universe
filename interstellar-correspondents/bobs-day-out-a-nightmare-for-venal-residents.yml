- body: "BoB\u2019s day out, a nightmare for Venal residents? Last night there were
    an exceptionally large number of pilots surrounding the Venal Region when Band
    of Brothers decided to relax a little up north. Venal has always been a heavily
    contested area and lately it has been a central region for the Phoenix Alliance
    together with their close friends NBSI Alliance and The Forsaken Empire. In the
    last two months the Five has been flying around the area as well, with nothing
    else on their mind but the total destruction of PA and friends. \n\nThe evening
    started with the Five attacking the F-E pos in the system H-PA29, which is a major
    basis of operation for many alliances. Wise men know that if you are looking for
    a fight, then the place to be is that little system in Venal. The pos of F-E survived
    the onslaught of dreadnoughts and other ships because the Five decided to retreat
    when they heard a hostile force was on its way to engage. \n\nLater on the Five
    and BoB met up in 9-266Q facing the combined fleet of PA, F-E and NBSI, reports
    regarding this battle are contradicting. Five claims there was hardly a battle
    to speak off when PA, F-E and NBSI hid as soon as they entered the system, and
    El Covah said that even though his systems were malfunctioning slightly he believes
    PA and F-E won. It\u2019s always hard to determine who won a battle, especially
    when a neutral reporter arrives too late to see for herself, but the real strange
    factor here is BoB. What are they doing in Venal? \n\nI asked Carth Jared whether
    the Five invited BoB to assist them in the destruction of the three Northern Alliances,
    the answer was negative Carth Jared: \u201CPersonally I would rather have them
    out of the way, if they hadn\u2019t been here today the PA/F-E force might have
    engaged us\u201D. PA and F-E are worried that BoB is back to help Five in the
    removal of the PA, F-E and NBSI, but they are confident that even if they work
    together they will fail. Le Cardinal: \u201CPA is here and we intend to stay\u201D.
    El Covah: \u201CBoB and Five have failed so many times, Five has failed in scalding
    path, BoB has failed here and they will fail again.\u201D \n\nAccording to Shrike
    BoB is only visiting Venal for some rest and recreation, he compares Venal to
    an old girlfriend, you have been there before and you can have her again, but
    the excitement is gone. It seems BoB is not out to claim Venal or to chase the
    three alliances away from Venal and its surrounding areas. BoB is only there for
    some relaxation and chasing up the locals for a cheap thrills. \n\nShrike is not
    worried that this little fieldtrip may finally unite several large alliances in
    a full scale attack on BoB in Fountain. Shrike: \u201CNBSI is falling apart with
    E-R leaving, FE don\u2019t know any space five jumps from D7, PA going somewhere
    else to actually try and attack?\u201D In return F-E is not impressed by Five
    and BoB either. Silus Yarmon: \u201CWe are aware of the leadership issues within
    the Five and its impending disbandment, and BoB presence here today is mainly
    a recruiting attempt for the remaining corporations of the Five.\u201D \n\nWhether
    the Five are having leadership issues remains to be seen and might lead up to
    another story."
