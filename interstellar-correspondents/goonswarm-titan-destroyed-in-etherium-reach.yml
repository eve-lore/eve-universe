- body: "**Etherium Reach** \u2013 An Erebus titan piloted by Deadtear of GoonSwarm
    was destroyed in a combat operation yesterday involving three titan-class capital
    ships, including a Leviathan from Solar Fleet, and a Ragnarok from Legion of xxDeathxx.
    A number of alliances resident in the drone regions participated in taking down
    this massive ship, and thereby preventing it from assisting Ethereal Dawn in defending
    their sovereign space. \n\nThe events leading up to this loss started with a small
    roaming gang of Smash Alliance members travelling R-6KYM in an attempt to kill
    forces hostile to them. When they were unable to provoke an immediate response,
    an assault was made on the cynosural jammer protecting the system and a control
    tower deployed nearby. This initial action became the cause of much larger fights
    over the next five days, with each side bringing more allies and increasing the
    size of the engagements.\n\nThe final engagement that led to the destruction of
    the ship started when the three titans warped to a hostile group of battleships
    near a stargate in R-6KYM, and fired their Doomsday Devices. In attempting to
    make good their exit by warping out, a single titan was caught by hostile forces
    and prevented from escaping.\n\nThe ensuing battle involved alliance members from
    Atlas Alliance, Fang Alliance, R0ADKILL, SMASH Alliance, The Kano Organisation,
    and Veritas Immortalis arrayed against those attempting to defend the titan; Ethereal
    Dawn, Intrepid Crossing, Legion of xXDEATHXx, SOLAR FLEET, Ka-Tet, and GoonSwarm.
    After 15 to 20 minutes of concentrated fire, the Erebus could no longer hold up
    against the assault, and she went down. \n\nBobby Atlas, a fleet commander for
    Atlas Alliance had this to say: _\u201CGoonSwarm entering the conflict, for many
    of us it provided a new found vigour to engage the enemy, and less than a day
    into any serious GoonSwarm actions one of their titans was downed in the defence
    of Ethereal Dawn space.\u201D_\n\nAt the time of writing GoonSwam representatives
    declined to comment about the incident."
