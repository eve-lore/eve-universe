    to be given away through a lottery as rare as the prizes themselves, the Interstellar
    Correspondents have been informed.  \n  \nThe Guardian Vexor, a variant of the
    widely-available Vexor class cruiser, is prized among collectors for its expanded
    drone control systems that allow it to field twice the number of drones normally
    supported by sub-capital ships.  \n  \nDuring a recent interview, Chribba estimates
    that out of a possible fifty-five Guardian Vexors known to have been made available
    to capsuleers nearly five years ago \"Thirty to Thirty-five Guardian Vexors are
    still in existence.\" It is also unknown how many of them may sit in retired capsuleers
    hangers; Chribba agreed \"I'm sure they could be, or kept as trophies.\"  \n  \nWhatever
    the number may be this is a chance for all of New Eden to acquire a piece of Gallente
    history. Chribba stated \"Most seem to enjoy the chance to own such a rarity for
    a small sum of ISK compared to buying one for some 15-20 billion.\"  \n  \nChribba
    is a well-known capsuleer and often trusted third-party to many large transactions;
    he had been contracted by two parties owning the ships to arrange the lottery.
    In keeping with his own privacy policy, Chribba declined to share the identities
    of the owners. \"Names cannot be mentioned,\" he said, but added that \"they are
    welcome to step forward themselves.\"  \n  \nSpeaking of the reaction to the lottery
    so far, Chribba stated that the interest had been overwhelming. \"I estimate it
    to end in a few days as about 75% of the tickets have been sold.\"  \n  \n\"I'd
    like to thank the owners of the ships for providing me the chance to make such
    a special lottery,\" stated Chribba. \"Thank you to the pilots of New Eden for
    showing such an interest in this event.\"\n\n### Galnet Resources\n\n[Guardian-Vexor
