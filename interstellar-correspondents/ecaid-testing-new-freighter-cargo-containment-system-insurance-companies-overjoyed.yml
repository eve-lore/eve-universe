- body: "The ECAID division of ISD, in conjunction with Freighter manufacturers, cargo
    expander manufacturers and some ship insurance providers, are in final testing
    of a new cargo containment control system. \n\nThe updated control software resolves
    a major issue with dispersion of containment fields upon the destruction of a
    freighter. Previously, these containment fields would implode upon collapse, thus
    crushing the cargo and rendering it unsalvagable. The new control software reverses
    the implosion of the containment fields, protecting cargo containers so they may
    be recovered. \n\nInsurance companies and hauling corporations are heralding this
    as a major improvement to their profit margin. Said Aidan Black, CEO of Serenity
    Search, Salvage and Storage, \"There have been a number of salvage ops where recovery
    was impossible due to containment field collapse. To me, hearing about a freighter
    getting popped has always been sad. All that lost revenue for recovery fees gone.
    This new software is going to improve my bottom line.\" \n\nIf the software upgrade
    meets all testing criteria, the upgrade will automatically be uploaded via Gal-Net
    on Tuesday."
