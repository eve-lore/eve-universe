    Eden** \\- In a startling change of pace, EVE University [E-UNI] has announced
    a temporary suspension of their Wartime Standard Operating Procedure [SOP].   \n
    \ \nThis policy, which forbids ratting, mining and hauling while under wardec,
    has served to protect many new pilots from losing ships and modules they really
    couldn't afford to lose.   \n  \nAccording to Irdalth Delrar, \"the reasons for
    the SOP have faded into legend\" and many new pilots suffer under the restrictions,
    so therefore came the decision to temporarily suspend all normal wartime rules.
    \  \n  \nAccording to Delrar, they expect to see an increase in wardecs during
    this time, believing there are a number of blue corps who would wardec them for
    the fun of it.   \n  \nA member of E-Uni said: \"I understand that the SOP might
    be boring to some members but I feel it is necessary. People that are questioning
    the SOP will see by themselves what happens when you are out there alone in a
    PVE setup and no help around.\"   \n  \nMembers of the corporation seem to be
    cautiously optimistic about this change , although several have also stated that
    they plan to keep to SOP regardless.   \n  \nThe SOP will be suspended for one
    month and after that remain suspended until the majority of E-UNI members vote
    for its return.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[No SOP Month](http://forum.eveuniversity.org/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=47360)
