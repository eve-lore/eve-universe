    tournament at 21:00 on May 3rd with the potential for an incredible **eleven and
    a half billion** isk 1st prize. \n\nThe \u201CEOH Eve Series of Poker - 1.05 B
    Tournament\u201D is only open to a maximum of eighteen players. Seating is on
    a first-come basis and at current writing, five slots are open for the first of
    two nine seat tables. \n\nThe entry fee for the tournament is 1,050 million isk.
    With a minimum of nine players for the tournament to proceed, the lowest grand
    prize of the tournament is a comfortable seven billion isk. Should all eighteen
    slots be filled, two tables will be run and the winners of each table will play
    off for the eleven and a half billion isk grand prize. \n\nEskaton, the second
    player to sign up for the tournament, had this to say; \"I joined this particular
    event because I got the time for that particular weekend, because I had the iskarinos
    to spare on the buy-in, but primarily because the bigger the buy-in the bigger
    the rush from playing. I have played against Bwill before a few times, won one
    of those times. Also I have played a few of the ppl who are still deciding to
    sign up, but havent actually done so yet.\" \n\nWhen asked if he has ever participated
    in other high stakes games, Eskaton told us; \"Never been in such a high stakes
    tourney before, max so far has been in the 100million isk range. I suspect this
    first tourney, and how it rolls, will determine if there will even BE any other
    high stakes games(and lets face it, a 1billion isk buy-in is nowhere near a lot
    of people's threshold of pain). If there are, and I got the time and isk for it,
    I will almost certainly be signing up for it\" \n\nCuebick, another early entrant,
    is also new to high stakes gaming; \"This is my first time gambling for such high
    stakes...I'm Caldarian, it's a well known fact that we desire wealth over everything
    else. I started out gambling in shady stations in deep lawless space, betting
    low amounts of isk. I recently heard that the owner of one of the biggest and
    most notorious poker syndicates, Selene D'Celeste is hosting a massive 1 billion
    isk buy-in tournament, with first place paying out a whopping 7 billions isk.
    My corporation, one of the oldest in Eve, The Collective, desperately needs isk
    to continue to make supercapitals, and with that in mind I quickly signed up.
    Selene told me that already people are betting on who will win. According to the
    bookies I'm the underdog.\" \n\nWith only a week left to go, odds are looking
    good for a single nine pilot table. Pod pilots interested in the Tournament should
