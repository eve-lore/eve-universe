- body: "YC 113.06.01 - YC 113.06.30\n\nThis month saw a colossal swing in the balance
    of power within the null security regions, with the group of alliances known as
    the \"Northern Coalition\" (NC) almost entirely losing their grasp over their
    holdings of several years. This sudden collapse has taken place after months of
    warring with the DRF (Drone Region Forces) coalition, resulting in the regions
    of Tribute, Branch and Tenal changing hands.  \n  \nThe focal point of this collapse
    was Tribute, which as the home of the Northern Coalition's largest alliance, Morsus
    Mihi, was long considered its capital region. With Tribute now firmly in the hands
    of DRF allies and the alliances of the NC on the move to other areas of new eden,
    this marks the close of this campaign.  \n  \nSeveral of the displaced alliances
    have moved to a new area of operations, the former IT Alliance homeland of Delve.
    Whilst this conflict only seems to be getting started, CONCORD has registered
    a substantial increase in the number of capsuleer-piloted vessels being destroyed
    there. In total, 14,974 vessels are registered as being lost in Delve during June
    compared to only 6,081 in May and an average of 5,061 per month from Jan 1st to
    May 31st.  \n  \nA new initiative by DED with these reports will be to report
    on a different statistic deemed to be of potential interest to capsuleers each
    month. This month, we have investigated which regions have seen the most losses
    on average each month since the current system of vessel loss registration began
    in late YC109.   \n  \nThe five most hostile regions are, based on average losses
    per month:  \nSyndicate - 14,130  \nPure Blind - 10,564  \nCurse - 10,155  \nProvidence
    - 9,636  \nCatch - 9,216  \n  \nStatistics for June:  \nSupercapitals destroyed:
    8 titans, 13 supercarriers  \nSupercapitals built: 24 titans, 123 supercarriers
    \ \nOutposts built: 10"
