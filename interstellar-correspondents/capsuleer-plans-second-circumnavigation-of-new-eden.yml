    is planning a second venture through New Eden in which he hopes to visit more
    than five hundred systems in less than two days.  \n  \n[Having already successfully
    completed a circumnavigation](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=3032&tid=7),
    DevilDogUSMC pointed out the reasons he believed it may have been a little disappointing:
    \"Last time there was no challenge. I was flying in the shadows and I did it!
    I survived but... Nobody got to be apart of such an amazing trip.\"  \n  \nThis
    time around, he plans to involve as many capsuleers as possible by inviting all
    those interested to the in-pod channel, \"Circle-Eve\", where he hopes capsuleers
    will \"feel free to talk\" to him about what he's seeing or what is happening.
    \ \n  \nIn addition to the channel, on the day of launch he will provide capsuleers
    another means of tracking his progress live.  \n  \nOn why he is doing it a second
    time, and why he will be taking risks, he said, \"I think [capsuleers] want to
    see more achievements being met. I can't wait to see others meet their goals.
    Maybe this will show them they can give it a shot, not just hear about it, but
    see it actually happen, and not have it be an after thought.\"  \n  \nHis last
    trip was accomplished in a Helios. This time he is keeping it a secret, teasing;
    \"if you want to know the ship type, you will need to come cheer me on. I welcome
    it.\"  \n  \nIf you would like to follow DevilDogUSMC and find out the exact start
    date, join in-pod channel \"Circle-Eve\". You can follow him live as well as chat
    with him.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this article? Do you have
