    \ by ISD Tedra Kerrigan\n\n**Dantumi, Lonetrek -** On Saturday the 16th of March,
    Rixx Javix is sponsoring and organizing what he calls a  'DeathRace' across the
    breadth of New Eden.\n\nThe race will start at 17:00 EVE time on March 16 and
    is free to all comers.\n\nJavix, a known pirate, says that he was partly inspired
    by a Badger race he participated in almost four years ago. Shortly after the Badger
    race, during a long and boring gate camp in Providence, the idea for a New Eden
    DeathRace was born.\n\nThe first DeathRace was held through Providence and had
    70 contestants, not all of whom made it to the finish line. Fighting among contestants
    is encouraged but not mandatory, and Javix warned that those who think to fit
    the fastest possible ship and make a run for it may find some unpleasant surprises
    along the route.\n\nThe total prize value of this year's DeathRace is almost up
    to five billion ISK now, divided into a number of categories. There is even a
    100mil ISK prize for the first pod to cross the finish line.\n\nYou can see the
    full prize list, as well as the rules of the competition below.\n\n \n\n###  GalNet
