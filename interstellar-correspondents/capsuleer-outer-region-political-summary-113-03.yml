    Forces (DRF) and the Northern Coalition (NC) over control of the Geminate region
    saw the fiercest fighting of March, with 19,382 ships being destroyed as a result
    of conflict between capsuleers. Whilst less than the 25,425 of February this is
    several times the average seen in YC112 of only 8,002 ships destroyed per month
    as a result of such activity.  \n  \nThe 20th of the month saw a colossal battle
    take place within the O2O-2X system in which the defending DRF successfully fought
    off an assault from the NC. This resulted in the loss of eight NC titans and four
    on the side of the DRF, a loss of titans matched only by the Valentine's Day Massacre
    last month in nearby low security space.  \n  \nFountain has seen a significant
    amount of conflict between capsuleers with 12,624 ships destroyed there throughout
    the month. In excess of five thousand of these were being piloted by capsuleers
    flying under the banner of the region's primary sovereignty holder, Test Alliance
    Please Ignore (TEST).  \n  \nFurther south, the former IT Alliance territories
    of Delve and Querious are still in a state of significant instability. Atlas alliance
    had attempted to settle within Querious with the support of their allies Against
    All Authorities and Cascade Imminent. They held six stations there at peak but
    have since lost these to Pandemic Legion who appear to be the dominant force in
    the area.\n\n_For an explanation of what CORPS is and to find links to past CORPS
