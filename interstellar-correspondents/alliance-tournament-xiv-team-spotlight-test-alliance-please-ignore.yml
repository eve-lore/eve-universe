    to the Alliance Tournament Team Spotlight, where we take a closer look at some
    of the teams competing in the [Alliance Tournament XIV](https://community.eveonline.com/community/alliance-tournament/).
    Today, we are looking at [Test Alliance Please Ignore](https://gate.eveonline.com/Alliance/test%20alliance%20please%20ignore)
    [TEST], who has had a team in the tournament before.\n\n![](http://imageserver.eveonline.com/Alliance/498125261_128.png)\n\nTEST
    has competed in the Alliance Tournament 4 times before - in Alliance Tournaments
    X, XI, XII, and XIII - every Alliance Tournament since Test Alliance Please Ignore
    was founded in YC112. In YC117 they reached the semi-finals before being smashed
    by THE RONIN. In this year's Alliance Tournament, TEST is among the seeded teams
    that did not have to compete for a place.\n\nTEST's captain [Soldarius](https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Soldarius)
    summarized their past Alliance Tournament performance as follows: \"In the past
    3 years TEST Alliance Please Ignore has not only participated, but placed in the
    top 12 twice. We may not be the most skilled pilots around. But under-estimating
    us is a sure way to lose a match. Knowing this weakness has encouraged us to work
    on our individual piloting and at least close the gap between our skill level
    and those of the best teams. We have been practicing non-stop since the Amarr
    Championships last November in the hopes that the extra effort will pay off this
    October.\"\n\nWith pilots from defunct alliances such as Camel Empire and Nulli
    Secunda finding new homes in already-strong alliances such as NC. and Pandemic
    Legion, things look tough for TEST this year.\n\nTEST is not despairing quite
    yet, however. According to Soldarius, the team has been practicing a lot more
    this year and joining in open scrimmages with other Alliance Tournament teams.
    \"My hope is that not only TEST will improve, but other alliances as well.\" They
    are definitely learning from their mistakes in last year's\n\n\"Do not underestimate
    us,\" Soldarius said as a message to the other teams. \"We are not as bad as you
    think we are.\"\n\nRecordings from previous tournaments:\n\n[TEST vs Tactical
    Narcotics Team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuvAz16R3YA) (AT XIII, Day 4)
    \ \n[TEST vs Easily Excited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmiHDd5_ma8) (AT
    XIII, Day 4)\n\nWe at the IC wish all teams the best of luck in the upcoming Alliance
    Tournament!\n\n \n\n* * *\n\nGot something newsworthy?  \nCome join us in the
    \"IC News Leads\" channel and let us know!"
