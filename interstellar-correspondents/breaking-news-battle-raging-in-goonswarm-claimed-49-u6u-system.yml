    Querious** \\- Over 547 ships have been lost in the last 24 hours and 216 of those
    in the last hour alone as GoonSwarm repels a Systematic-Chaos and Against ALL
    Authorities invasion of this GoonSwarm held system. SBUs have been deployed and
    battles are raging around them.  \n  \nHratli Smirks of GoonSwarm explains what
    he believes to be the reason for the attack in 49-U6U: \"Are you aware of Liam
    Fremen? He runs Sys-K. He has a huge [expletive deleted] for us literally...and
    he decided to invade us. Mostly to help out Molle, on account of he has this [affection
    for] Molle (he runs IT alliance)... Also, 49-U is the border to AAA space and
    that's basically as much effort as you can expect from AAA [and] allies\"  \n
    \ \nAlthough Goons appear to be holding onto the system, Hratli reports that \"AAA
    renter\" Ushra'Khan has killed 78 GoonSwarm carriers. What impact those losses
    will have on the ongoing defense of the system remains to be seen.  \n  \nA representative
    from Systematic-Chaos was contacted but leadership declined to comment while the
    operation was still ongoing.  \n  \nDetails will be reported as more information
    becomes available.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this article?
