    that GoonSwarm Alliance is conducting a new campaign against Hulks. GoonSwarm\u2019s
    kill board for this campaign, (titled [\"Jihadswarm\"](http://www.jihadswarm.com/)
    in their signature style) indicates that some 66 Hulks have been killed along
    with a few industrial ships so far. Another 100 or so Hulks and Mackinaws have
    been reported as killed on their [main board](http://killboard.goonfleet.com).
    \n\nI sat down with GoonSwarm diplomat Vile Rat and Karttoon, the leader of the
    Jihadswarm faction, to talk to them about this. Karttoon unabashedly confirmed
    that \"yes, we are engaging against any regular miner in Empire controlled space.\"
    He claimed that in the first five days of the campaign GoonSwarm had destroyed
    over 34 billion ISK of assets, and that in all some 250 ships have been destroyed
    thus far. \n\nVile Rat emphasized that this was not a campaign against new pod
    pilots, but against those who by now should be making it in lawless space with
    all of its dangers. \n\nWhen asked whether or not GoonSwarm was doing this for
    personal gain in the Hulk market both denied this was the case. \u201CFor far
    too long,\u201D Vile Rat said, \u201Cthe weak have lived under the protection
    of Concord\u2019s protective umbrella and have gotten rich off the backs of the
    working class.\u201D \n\nWhen asked if GoonSwarm would be ransoming Hulks during
    this campaign Karttoon said, \"We shall allow penance for the wealth hoarders
    to remain on our holy land.\" His comments seemed to suggest that GoonSwarm is
    claiming all of Empire controlled space as their own, if not materially then in
    some spiritual manner. \n\nCalimor, a New Eden researcher, points out that GoonSwarm's
    campaign is affecting the black market where ISK is exchanged for black market
    currencies. \"Although many innocents are being attacked, miners who work for
    outlaw corporations are feeling a huge hit.\" Prices on the black market have
    gone up 50% since GoonSwarm's campaign began. \n\nThe Ex-Band of Brothers spymaster
    Digital Communist, himself no stranger to the dark underbelly of New Eden, had
    his own [theory](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=713297)
    as to what was driving the GoonSwarm campaign. He also referred to recent actions
    taken by Triumvirate. who have similarly been making life much harder for Empire-dwellers.\n\nWhatever
    the underlying reasons may be, it is becoming increasingly clear that CONCORD's
    influence over the actions of capsuleers within supposedly \"lawful\" space is
    once again being challenged. The common perception that CONCORD-enforced space
    is safer for capsuleers than the frontier regions has long been considered something
    of a myth. \n\n\"There's a cyclical nature to CONCORD's power over the capsuleer
    class,\" remarked Amir Kevash, an Associate Professor of the new \"Capsuleer Studies\"
    department at Caille State University. \n\n\"[Pod pilots] will find a loophole,
    exploit it for personal gain or indeed, simple amusement. CONCORD will move to
    plug the gap as always. A few months later, as tactics and technologies evolve,
    a new workaround will be found and once again CONCORD will be on the back foot.
    From the Goons and the recent Black Ops jumpdrive fiasco to as far back as the
    now-infamous smartbombing of Yulai and earlier, there has always been a certain
    to-and-fro between the two groups.\"\n\nKevash remarked that with the recent [problems](http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=1808&tid=4)
    CONCORD was already facing, they were likely already stretched too thin to deal
    with smaller issues in a timely fashion, leaving empire-bound capsuleers to fend
    for themselves for the time being, perhaps indefinitely. \n\n\"It's getting to
    the point where it's becoming flagrant. Podders are once again flaunting their
    disregard for the rule of law. Their methods are becoming as widely-spread in
    terms of knowledge as they are in terms of a shrugging acceptance amongst the
    populace. Take that egger vonHolst's recent [holovid](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=708473)
    for example. Not only does it bring the issue to a huge audience, not only does
    it display the methodology, but it does so with an unmistakable sense of pride.
    It's yet another bump on CONCORD's increasingly rocky road.\" \n\nAlmost as if
    to confirm Kevash's statements, Vile Rat ended his comments by addressing empire-dwellers
    with the remarks: \u201CYou are on notice; we are coming for you.\u201D One thing
    is for sure--miners in Empire controlled space have a new danger to watch out
    for."
