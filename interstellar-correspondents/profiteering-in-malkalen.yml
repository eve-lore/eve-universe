- body: "A disturbing development in Malkalen has some pod pilots questioning the
    compassion of their brethren. Within a few hours of Ishukone\u2019s call for pod
    pilots to fill buy orders of essential relief goods, profiteers have already placed
    buy orders preempting Ishukone\u2019s. \n\nOne such pilot, Maru Sha of The Department
    of Justice corporation, has admitted that she is currently sitting on over one
    billion isk worth of antibiotics and hydrogen batteries procured by slipping in
    slightly higher buy orders than Ishukone. Although Maru claims that her goal is
    not profit, she has nonetheless admitted to selling some of her stock because:
    _\u201DI had competitors on the market and I already had invested all my money
    and that of a few friends; so in order to compete with the raising price, and
    adjust mine accordingly, I had to sell part of the goods.\u201D_\n\nWhen asked
    what prompted her actions, Maru claimed that politics is to blame; _\u201C[Caldari
    State\u2019s] treacherous cooperation with the Amarr, their support of slavery
    in Minmatar space and many more things made me think it was time for payback.
    Let me remind you that the goods now in my hands will not be wasted. There are
    many people in Minmatar space who are in need of cheap Antibiotics. Hydrogen Batteries
    are also needed in every household. I just relocate them to people who really
    deserve them and need to get them at cheap prices.\u201D_\n\nGotrek65, another
    pod pilot accused of profiteering, steadfastly denies the allegations. When asked
    if he knew that his actions were drawing off much needed supplies in Malkalen,
    his response was; _\u201CIt may. It's nothing personal to the owners of the Malkalen
    station. It's just that I'm trying to get my own station ready to be anchored.\u201D_\n\nMany
    pod pilots are incensed at this kind of behavior. In the case of Maru Sha\u2019s
    corporation, Kyoko Sakoda tells us that; _\u201CThat entire corporation, The Department
    of Justice, was in on it [profiteering]. My cousin, Sayuri Itsu, who aided in
    the relief efforts, was the first to test the buy order in paranoid fashion and
    check her transaction logs. Smart woman she's become. It's my inkling that the
    buy order was filled rather rapidly and additional ones were setup by the aforementioned
    corporation. Sayuri alerted our friends in Omerta Syndicate, who are now pursuing
    DoJ targets. I wish them best of luck.\u201D_\n\nAs more alleged disaster profiteers
    are named, we will report to you what we discover."
