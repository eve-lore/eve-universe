    the glory and lucrative rewards that come with first place. In second place was
    Pandemic Legion, with Cruel Intentions and Terra Incognita taking equal third.
    \n\nThe final rounds saw some of the most exciting match-ups in the tournament,
    with many upsets as underdogs came out victorious against more established and
    well known alliances. HUN Reloaded themselves were something of an unknown quantity.
    Now however, as the bearers of the Alliance Tournament Cup and Gold Medal, they
    will forever be known as one of the elite few who have won an Alliance Championship.\n\n\u201CMay
    their glory shine through eternity,\u201D stated Woratome Kikawa, CEO of the Independent
    Gaming Commission which organised the tournament. In a press release issued afterwards,
    he thanked the participants for their attendance and outlined the rewards each
    winner would receive. \n\nSpeaking on behalf of his alliance in an interview,
    Jotan Veer, diplomat of HUN Reloaded shared some of the highlights of the tournament
    for his team.\n\n\u201CThe final was an obvious display of superiority, however
    I believe the matches against Cult of War and later against Cruel Intentions were
    the hardest fights to win. Personally, I will never forget the two Hyperions in
    the Chaos Incarnate fight\u2026two huge battleships charging directly into our
    tightly-packed team was a bit terrifying to watch, even if I knew they weren\u2019t
    a threat.\u201D\n\n\u201CPandemic Legion probably lost in the \u2018mind game\u2019
    part of the fight, since they predicted wrongly what our first move would be\u2026their
    setup was sound and their tactics were brilliant, so the match could have gone
    a lot differently.\u201D\n\nSpeaking about what makes a successful team, Veer
    offered: \u201CMost certainly teamwork. We never broke ranks, followed our Team
    Captain\u2019s orders always. This combined with the work of the two Basilisk
    pilot\u2019s allowed us to adapt to every situation and sometimes change plans
    on the way.\u201D\n\n\u201COur opponents in the finals are some of the most experienced
    0.0 small gang combat alliances. We have locked horns with almost all of them
    during our careers and developed huge respect for their skills an experience.
    I believe the daily struggle in zero-sec space most certainly provides the foundation
    to excel in the tournament, especially the fourth, where the rule changes made
    it a lot more similar to real engagements.\u201D\n\nWhen asked what HUN planned
    to do with their financial reward, a whopping 20-million Loyalty Point stash granted
    by Serpentis, whom they represented in the tournament Veer replied with the same
    level of class HUN had shown throughout the tournament. \u201CWe have no intentions
    to destroy the market prices of Serpentis goods, if we use the loyalty points
    then we will use them coordinated as a team, just like how we fought in the tournament.\u201D\n\nVeer
    finished by thanking the organisers and contestants. \u201CThis was the first
    alliance tournament we participated in, both as pilots and as an alliance. We
    had lots and lots of fun, and bring home some awesome memories. Thank you everyone.\u201D\n\nFor
