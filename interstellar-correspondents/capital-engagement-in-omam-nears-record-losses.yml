    KADOR** \\- A Tuesday morning siege of a Cry Havoc [C H] dysprosium moon by the
    Northern Coalition ended in a near record breaking capital ship engagement. Pandemic
    Legion [-10.0] hotdropped the operation with the assistance of a large support
    contingent from Cry Havoc and allied pirate elements.   \n  \nThe battle began
    just after midnight and lasted until approximately 04:00. In the end, it is believed
    that one hundred and thirteen capital class vessels met their demise - falling
    just eleven ships short of what is believed to be the single battle record of
    one hundred and twenty-four.   \n  \nAccording to a detailed analysis by Shadoo,
    Pandemic Legion and allies suffered sixty-four capital losses to the NC's forty-nine
    losses. Additionally, the Cry Havoc starbase was successfully demolished and the
    NC held the field after Pandemic Legion ran out of capital fleets within a reasonable
    distance of Omam.\n\n### 00:30\n\nAfter providing Pandemic Legion with a large
    amount of intel on the NC fleet, Cry Havoc was told to open a cyno at sniping
    range of the NC capital fleet. The capital ship numbers were stacked in the NC's
    favor with around one hundred and ten NC capitals (including thirty or so carriers)
    to Pandemic Legion's fifty-five dreadnoughts.   \n  \nThe support fleet numbers
    were much the opposite. The Cry Havoc, Advocated Destruction, Huzzah Federation,
    Laconian Syndicate, Honour Bound, Beyond Divinity Inc, and Eternal Rapture combined
    support fleet greatly outnumbered that of the NC (4 to 1 according to Shadoo)
    and successfully tackled the NC capital fleet in coordination with Pandemic Legion's
    cyno entry.  \n  \nOver five hundred pilots were reported in local at this time.
    \  \n  \nAt 00:55 the NC acquired a warp-in on the Pandemic Legion sniping fleet
    and the battle rapidly turned in the NC's favor. For the most part, the capital
    engagement concluded around 02:00 with Pandemic Legion losing its fleet and the
    NC losing approximately twenty-five capitals.\n\n### 02:45\n\nPandemic Legion
    again cyno'ed dreadnoughts onto the field along with Cry Havoc capitals and one
    Huzzah Federation dreadnought as the NC dreadnoughts finished their last siege
    cycle on the Cry Havoc station. Eventually the NC capital fleet was forced to
    jump out for more fuel. For a brief period Pandemic Legion and Cry Havoc had the
    upper hand, but they were again outnumbered as the NC fleet returned.   \n  \n\"We've
    now lost 2 waves of PL dreads and\u2026 run out of fleets in range unfortunately
    -- fight's over,\" announced Shadoo over GalNet at 04:02\n\n### Aftermath\n\nThe
    large support fleet advantage certainly worked in Pandemic Legion's favor, but
    in the end, the gap in capital ship numbers proved to be too high an obstacle
    to overcome.   \n  \n\"\u2026 with [the] NC continuing to pump guys into [the]
    system, we just weren't ever going to catch up on numbers,\" explained Mistress
    Suffering of Cry Havoc.   \n  \nThe NC is already enjoying the spoils of their
    victory with the deployment of their own station on the dysprosium moon, but the
    pirate forces may actually have secured a small, underhanded victory of their
    own given the fact that the battle occurred in CONCORD designated low security
    space.   \n  \nLarge security ratings drops have been reported by quite a few
    NC pilots on GalNet making travel in empire space just a bit more difficult for
    the coalition. \"One RZR guy went from 8.0 to -6.0,\" reported Fred0 of Razor.\n\n###
