- body: "The new Ultra-Quafe advertisment campaign has sparked a lot of controversy
    in both Amarr and Caldari. Drink Starsi\u2122 has been one of the most vocal Caldari
    corporations in denouncing their competitor's strategy, even going as far as calling
    for the complete removal of all Quafe advertising in Caldari-controlled space.
    \ \n  \n**Jera** , the CEO of the Caldari soft drink corp, graciously granted
    me an interview despite her busy schedule.  \n  \n**Q and A session with Jera**
    \ \n**Beringe** : _\"Can you tell us a little about your corporation? What and
    where is Drink Starsi\u2122, exactly?\"_  \n  \n**Jera** : _\"Drink Starsi\u2122
    is a loyal Caldari corporation, thus supporting the Executive Chief Panel; Conscious
    of its humble status compared with the major Caldari corporations, Drink Starsi\u2122
    line of conduct is to keep a neutral stance as long as it does not go against
    the State's superior interests.\"  \n_  \n_\"Drink Starsi\u2122's business lies
    in the production, distribution, sale and advertisement of its exclusive, high
    quality product : the refreshing and healthy Starsi\u2122.\"  \n_  \n_\"Starsi\u2122
    is currently being produced and sold only in Caldari and Khanid space, but the
    corporation is studying the possibilities of expanding its network of resellers
    in Amarr and Minmatar space. There is currently no project of selling Starsi\u2122
    in the Gallente space at this juncture.\"_  \n  \n**Beringe** : _\"With which
    of the big Caldari corporations does Drink Starsi\u2122 relate the most to?\"_
    \ \n  \n**Jera** : _\"Drink Starsi\u2122 was set up by an Ytiri investment division.
    Its CEO recently bought back all the corporation shares, gifting Drink Starsi\u2122
    with full independence. From this common past, Drink Starsi\u2122 head staff has
    kept strong links within the Ytiri agents department.\"_  \n  \n**Beringe** :
    _\"It must be difficult for a small corporation to compete with a megacorp such
    as Quafe. How can you hope to stand up to an industry giant like that? Do you
    have allies in your struggle with Quafe?\"_  \n  \n**Jera** : _\"The memory of
    heroes such as Yakiya Tovil-Toba inspire us when facing obviously overpowered
    superiority. Yet the Quafe company suffers from its gigantism, and its actions
    against its competitors, barely legal or not, take time to be set up and reach
    effectiveness. Drink Starsi\u2122 keeps a vigilant eye on the Gallente corporation
    moves, and has learned to react swiftly and efficiently.\"  \n  \n\"And yes we
    do have allies : our numerous customers, who support us by buying Starsi\u2122
    on a regular basis and giving us the financial strength we need to keep struggling...
    on the soda market.\"_  \n  \n**Beringe** : _\"Why the call for removal of Quafe
    ads in Caldari space? Surely, advertising is a fair way to compete on the free
    market? Isn't competition exactly the spirit of which the Caldari state is built
    on?\"_  \n  \n**Jera** : _\"Indeed, advertising is one of the multiple aspects
    a healthy economy must bear, at least if the access to the advertising media is
    opened on a free market. Actually this is not the case : numerous corporation,
    Caldari or others, are willing to rent advertising space, especially on the impressive
    bulletin board network, and ready to put on the desk sheer amounts of ISK, but
    all theses corporations are facing an administrative blockade. Well, not all of
    them, some seem to be privy to special favours, as the Quafe Company does. There
    is no room for such an anti-capitalistic behaviour in Caldari space.\"_  \n  \n**Beringe**
    : _\"Does Drink Starsi\u2122 really stand a chance against Quafe? Some Caldari
    might say that a small company like yours shouldn't stand a chance against a giant
    like Quafe - that only the strongest should survive in the ideal Capitalistic
    system. Any thoughts on that?\"_  \n  \n**Jera** : _\"Drink Starsi\u2122 has never
    asked for any kind of help. Since the corporation founding, we have been going
    straight to our objectives without any compromise agreement and no matter what
    people say about our chances to be successful on a market locked by the Quafe
    Company. Yet we have a growing customer base that support our effort and are far
    away from giving up.\"  \n  \n\"Yet I would remind to 'some Caldari' that effectiveness
    does not come along with gigantism, and advise them to use some of their scheduled
    rest time to watch historical holoreels : if the Caldari State survived successfully
    its past threats, it is trough the tactical use of its light yet swift structures
    against massive yet clumsy opponents.\"_  \n  \n**Beringe** : _\"There have been
    certain allegations that Drink Starsi\u2122 has been involved with certain possibly
    illegal activities, such as the raiding of Quafe convoys. How do you respond to
    that?\"_  \n  \n**Jera** : _\"It is good to see our competitors having to rely
    on slandering against us, it proves how uneasy they are with our growing strength
    and how clueless they are when trying to slow our progress. Do you know that one
    of them, who remained anonymous, hired some low-wage mercenaries, the Ferijo Faction
    or something like that, to destroy our convoys during a few weeks ?\"  \n  \n\"Now
    I must admit many actions of Drink Starsi\u2122 did harm the Quafe Company business,
    but always in a legal way. I would give for example the 'Save Timmy' funds that
    were raised to cure the sickness of children being highly addicted to Quafe and
    suffering physical disorders caused by the abuse of the product. Poor Timmy died
    murdered as he was visiting the Caldari Mourning Ceremonial in Luminaire, but
    I won't comment on this tragedy to stay on subject.\"_  \n  \n**Beringe** : _\"And
    finally, what does being a loyalist Caldari corporation entail? In what ways are
    such corporations better than other forms of business?\"_  \n  \n**Jera** : _\"Two
    keywords : memory and dedication. Memory reminds us what we all came through and
    which values found the State. Dedication is our honour to protect what our ancestors
    gave their lives for, and respect our traditions. Then all will be done for the
    good of many.\"  \n  \n\"Now my time with you is over citizen, duty calls.\"_
    \ \n  \n**Beringe** : _\"Thank you kindly, citizen Jera, and the best of luck
    to you and your corporation.\"_"
