- body: "The final day of the group stages was one marred by the most forfeits in
    the competition, but those games that did go ahead provided some firsts for the
    Tournament. \n\nSaturday saw the first tied game of the tournament between Ascendant
    Frontier and Electus Matari which ended with no kills on either side. While Interstellar
    Alcohol Conglomerate surprised commentators with a deliberate loss against Kaos
    Empire, in an apparent attempt to manipulate the tournament in their favour and
    fight Band of Brothers in the finals. \n\nVeritas Immortalis and Fate Weaves finally
    kicked proceedings off in a winner-takes-all match; with -V- qualifying for the
    second round despite losing their Basilisk to a warp drive malfunction. Red Alliance
    refused to risk a third Bhaalgorn versus Band of Brothers and forfeited the match.
    \n\nUshra'Khan was only able to field two pilots for their fifth match against
    Stain- Alliance who provided their opponents with a two versus two fight despite
    having a full team. Stain- Alliance won the match two kills to no losses. \n\nMercenary
    Coalition defeated Chorus of Dawn in an awesome display of firepower whilst Lotka
    Volterra earned a time-out win over NORAD, the latter finishing with their Navy
    Issue Apocalypse intact. OXIDE also won their first game of the tournament against
    Goonswarm in the final group D match. \n\nThe Red Skull won their match five ships
    to two against Prime Orbital Systems while The SUdden Death Squad defeated Fountain
    Alliance after the latter entered the arena with only three pilots. \n\nExuro
    Mortis qualified for the Second Round by outgunning Axiom Empire in a time-out
    win. Apparently unsure as to whether their Raven or Zealot would be focussed on,
    Axiom Empire provided shield support to the Zealot and this ultimately proved
    to be their downfall. \n\nT R U S T won the final match of the day four ships
    to two against Kaos Empire after the latter fielded only four vessels. The result
    split Group G three ways with three teams on nine points and it was to be Interstellar
    Alcohol Conglomerate and Kaos Empire that advanced to the second round."
