    a point it would ever spill into empire space. Last night, the resident faction
    in Great Wildlands 'The Keiretsu' sought to take the fight to claim the Great
    Wildlands region further than most would have ever expected by chasing and engaging
    resistance forces 'The Foundation' in the empire system of Egbinger.   \n  \nMolden
    Heath locals looked on in complete disbelief as the Great Wildlands resistance
    forces the Foundation fought a bloody battle with The Keiretsu at the gates.   \n
    \ \nReports from locals indicate over 100 ships were seen fighting, neither intent
    on letting up, regardless of the rattling fire from the empire Sentry guns.   \n
    \ \nAs the sentries took their toll, the fleets started to scatter and retreat,
    escape pods and ship debris from both sides were seen strewn across the gate.
    This messy battle proves that the conflict may actually run deeper than many may
    have first thought.   \n  \nIn the past, many of The Foundation corporations had
    been individually at war with former occupiers of the Great Wildlands, the Curse
    Alliance. The Foundation seem to hold the same principles to fight any new faction
    trying to claim the region and have banded together in response.   \n  \nThe Keiretsu,
    friendly or NAP'd with most of the major powers in EVE seem committed to regain
    control and instil order to the war ravaged former Curse Alliance region - the
    Great Wildlands.   \n  \nWhether this conflict will continue to escalate will
    certainly be a concern to the major powers in EVE and a definitely situation to
    watch carefully in the future."
