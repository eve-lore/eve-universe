    when the headlines are replete with stories of war, trials, and hardship, there
    occasionally shines a beacon of hope reminding us of our humanity and the virtues
    that have carried us through the millennia. On October 20th, 106 EST, starship
    captains Animator and Asentia\u2014both of Moya Warfare, Incorporated\u2014pledged
    eternal union to one another in a wedding ceremony presided over by members of
    the charitable Polaris Corporation. There were approximately 25 guests in attendance.
    \ \n\n\nIt was a surreal scene, as dozens of powerful warships converged on the
    Ceremonial Grounds in New Caldari for the occasion. With the bride\u2019s Scorpion
    and the groom\u2019s Raven positioned directly across from each other in front
    of the Circle of Unity, the ceremony began with the Polaris member WishStone\u2019s
    words:  \n\n\n\u201CDear gathered, some things around us are as old as time! When
    I look out my window, I see a sun, blazing. It has been here for stretches of
    time\u2026and so it has seen things we might never know. Today this celestial
    body will stand guard over us as it watches something as old as humanity: love.
    The sole reason for our gathering tonight, is to celebrate the love that two of
    your friends have found, and vow to never let this love die\u2026\u201D  \n\n\n\u201C\u2026It
    may not be the way of your race, Animator and Asentia, to marry for the purpose
    of love and happiness. But I say: Why should you not also find each other for
    that very reason alone? It is reason enough! So I congratulate you on finding
    something so precious in the vastness between the stars.\u201D  \n\n\nClose friends
    Jarvis and Dowcipnis gave the bride and groom away to each other, respectively.
    Then the couple then exchanged vows:  \n\n\n**WishStone:** \u201CAnimator! What
    vows would you bring to your bride on this night? What do you promise her, now,
    forever, till the stars grow cold?\u201D  \n\n\n**Animator:** \u201CAll I promise
    is that I will love her for the rest of my life, she brings me great happiness,
    and that is all I can ask.\u201D  \n\n\n**WishStone:** \u201CAnd you, Asentia?
    What vows do you bring to your groom? What would you promise him, now, forever,
    until the stars grow cold?\u201D  \n\n\n**Asentia:** \u201CI will love you in
    eternity, and of course will always be here to support you, even when death would
    depart us\u2026I would still give you my love and will always be with you now
    and forever!\u201D  \n\n\nWith that, WishStone gave her final blessings, and to
    the enthusiastic cheers and applaud of the wedding guests, introduced them for
    the first time as Mr. and Mrs. Animator-Asentia. So overjoyed was Dowcipnis that
    he demanded celebratory fireworks and then self-destructed his own cruiser, joyfully
    flying his pod through the swarms of drones released by the other guests.  \n\n\nThe
    local governments are happy to release administrative responsibilities for marriages
    to the Polaris Corporation, since they offer their services free of charge and
    are well known for both their remarkable technological prowess and humanitarian
    efforts across the galaxy. Other couples interested in making serious inquiries
    about marriage ceremonies should contact WishStone of Polaris for more details."
