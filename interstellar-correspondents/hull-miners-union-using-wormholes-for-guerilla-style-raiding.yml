    - KingRizen of the Hull Miner's Union [ONION], has formally declared his corporation's
    intent to utilize wormhole space in an attempt to bring guerilla-style warfare
    to New Eden.   \n  \nThe Hull Miner's Union, formerly of the disbanded Red Skulls
    alliance, believe that they are a tight-knit and highly proficient combat corporation.
    Formerly freebooters in several low-security regions, they made an abortive attempt
    to seize space in Syndicate, only to be repulsed by the Huzzah Federation.   \n
    \ \nThe discovery of wormhole space has given capsuleers the means to cross the
    length and breadth, if unpredictably, of New Eden. It is the Hull Miner's Union's
    intent to use this new capability to go deep into otherwise well-defended regions,
    strike at targets, and then withdraw into wormhole space. In the words of ONION
    Co-CEO, KingRizen, \"We will not be announcing our arrival, although you will
    know you are being hunted, you will not know from where or when.\"   \n  \nThis
    new direction has already borne fruit for the Hull Miners in the Great Wildlands.
    KingRizen explains; \"Earlier yesterday the corp managed to get a faction fit
    Typhoon and a Drake to eject from their ships only to get [pod killed] due to
    a heavy [interdictor] bubble.\" According to KingRizen, ONION has also made appearances
    in Scalding Pass and Cache.   \n  \nThe Hull Miners state that they have no plans
    on actually basing out of wormhole space at the present time; they wish only to
    use it as a means of acquiring new targets, both inside and outside of the wormholes.
    Given the added complications of capital ship entry, ONION has removed wormhole
    based towers from their target list.   \n  \nWhen asked about any strategies he
    would suggest to those who would follow in his corporation's path, KingRizen had
    this to say, \"As for strategies, we tend to use wormholes a lot for unexpected
    backdoor roams, and keeping it small and tight\", and further, \"When roaming
    in big alliance back systems it's good to stay mobile.\"   \n  \nAlthough many
    pilots wished ONION good luck, several responded to the statement with scorn:
    \"Will you bring a [tower] with you to hide at too?\"; asked The Jackhammer. Marlona
    Sky added: \"I'm so glad you shared this super important information with us.
    I am increasing our 'Homeland Defense' budget by 1% to prepare for these invasions
    of epic proportions.\"\n\n### GALNET Resources:\n\n[Official Announcement](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1021532)\n\n
