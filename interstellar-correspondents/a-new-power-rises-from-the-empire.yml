- body: "Empires rise and Empires fall, but tonight saw the rise of the latest one,
    for tonight was the ceremony which formally announced the formation of the Aegis
    Militia Alliance.   \n  \nMeeting in Haras, at the second starbase they have opened
    to reclaim the system from the Blood Raiders, pilots from the 4 member corporations,
    Murkon Prime Interstellar Productions, The Aeternus Crusade, Amarria Auxillia
    and the executor corporation, Ubiqua Seraph, ratified the charter which they have
    all sworn an oath to follow.   \n  \nTheir alliance has been formed to defend
    the Empire and the Amarrian people from any threats that it may face. The officials
    for the alliance made it quite clear that they do not believe that Emperor Doriam
    II is doing enough to protect the Amarr Empire from the threats it faces, and
    that for it to be protected properly they must take matters into their own hands.
    The Alliance executor, Mirial, also spoke passionately about \"Bringing light
    to wherever darkness may be\".   \n  \nIt is their unique stance where they pledge
    to defend the Empire, even if it goes against the will of the Emperor, which they
    believe sets them apart from other loyalist alliances. Mirial said, \"We are guided
    by our faith and dedication. Too often now, there is internal corruption within
    the Empire. We stand for the Empire and the Amarrian people, which is distinct
    from the interests of any Emperor. Often the two coincide but not always and the
    interests of God and Empire are the greater goal\", highlighting a previously
    unheard of lack of faith in the Emperor.   \n  \nThe ceremony was attended by
    many pilots from the member corporations, almost exclusively in Amarr Battleships,
    including an Imperial and a Navy Apocalypse. In a spectacularly well rehearsed
    display of technical flying they swarmed in formation around their new starbase
    as their charter was ratified. Many of the pilots, overcome with awe cried out
    with respect and admiration that all of their hard work was finally achieving
    fruition.   \n  \nOnce the charter was ratified they wasted no time in declaring
    war on the Ushra\u2019Kahn, branding them as heathens, rebels and terrorists.
    The motion for war was passed unanimously with no abstentions, saying that the
    war would only be retracted \"once they stop their terrorist actions\".   \n  \nAs
    a further and final act, to seal the ceremony, the fleet proceeded to wipe out
    a rogue drone hive, which had taken up residence in the Hara system, sweeping
    through the deadspace pocket with merciless efficiency.   \n  \nOnce the ceremony
    was over Mirial spoke of the future, stating that she believes the dedication
    of every single member of the Aegis Militia will allow them to see the trials
    ahead through. She also expressed her hope that more Pilots and corporations would
    join the struggle once their plight is known. She spoke finally of an economic
    boom thanks to the starbases in the system, delivering them riches previously
    unthought-of to strengthen their power.   \n  \nTonight a new empire has risen,
    whether it will fall is up to the test of time, but ask anyone in Haras who has
    seen the forces present whether they think the alliance will fall, and they will
    be hard pressed to say yes."
