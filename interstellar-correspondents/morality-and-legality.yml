- body: "Two of the main professions pod pilots engage in are mission running and
    mining. With these occupations attracting such large numbers, it is of little
    surprise to most that there are other more shady lines of work that thrive off
    the efforts of these pilots, namely ore theft and \u201Cninja\u201D salvaging.
    Although victims of these two activities question the morality of what they consider
    stealing, they also begrudgingly admit that the \u201Cthieves\u201D are well within
    the bounds of current law. \n\n**Ore Theft**\n\n* * *\n\nAlmost as old as the
    act of mining itself, ore theft has evolved significantly since its first days.
    Originally undertaken as a quick way to grab ore without the drudgery of mining
    it, ore thieves could at one point \u201Cacquire\u201D as much raw material as
    their ships could hold, all with complete impunity. Pressure from the mining community
    eventually forced CONCORD to rule that stealing ore was indeed a crime. From that
    moment, retaliation by the victim was sanctioned. \n\nWithin only days of the
    new ruling, opportunistic ore thieves discovered they could work the new laws
    to their own favor. Often they would perform a \u201Creverse aggression\u201D
    tactic to legally destroy the miner\u2019s ship, letting them not only take all
    the ore mined but also any surviving modules. In a reverse aggression tactic,
    the ore thief would steal the ore from a miner\u2019s jettison container and replace
    the container with his own. If the miner then reclaimed the ore from the \u201Cflipped\u201D
    container, he would incur the aggression charge of the ore thief. Buoyed by CONCORD
    intervention, many novice miners fell victim to this \u201Cloophole\u201D in the
    new legislation. \n\nWith the advent of Hulks and salvage abilities, incidents
    of reverse aggression escalated into a new profession. Pod pilot Elthen estimates
    that there are now \u201C80% \u2018flippers\u2019 [and] 20% looking for ore\u201D.
    Espejo Roto said, \u201CI know of a [new pod pilot] who took out a Retriever,
    Exequror, and Scythe [in] solo [combat]. Aside from having a ball, he got more
    money from the few minutes of conflict than he could have hoped for from days
    missions. A Retriever drops a million or two, and Hulks are juicy, so when it
    takes less than a minute to kill the miner... it's much better than mission boredom.\u201D
    \u201CSaying it\u2019s a full faction hulk, maybe 500 million ISK if his booster
    drops\u201D, added SkippyTheWonderTard. \n\nOne anonymous \u201Cflipper\u201D
    tells us that \u201Cit\u2019s near impossible to lose your pod in empire, so we
    can fly top end faction implants\u2026with relative safety for the implants at
    least\u201D \n\nDefense against this type of thievery is possible, but costly
    in either time or manpower. One pilot, DuPuy, has gone so far as to keep friends
    nearby to move the ore immediately and provide combat and logistic support to
    protect his mining ship. \n\n**Ninja Salvaging**\n\n* * *\n\nAs detailed in an
    [article](http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=1760&tid=7) earlier
    this year, \u201Cninja\u201D salvagers are pilots that salvage wrecks of mission
    contractees; commonly at times when the mission pilot is still in battle. Tchell
    Dahhn, CEO of Suddenly Ninjas, claims that \u201CI don't have an issue with those
    running missions for their agents per se, but when I fly into a deadspace zone,
    only to find the wrecks created by some headstrong pilot floating, broken, and
    left to rot, it angers me\u2026 if they would only clear up after their battles,
    cleaning my space, we wouldn't really have an issue, now, would we?\u201D \n\nDespite
    tongue-in-cheek claims of only cleaning up abandoned wrecks, Tchell was observed
    making this comment: \u201CI've rigged up three salvage tackles to make the job
    fast and efficient. Sure, they cost more than 40 million ISK, but they were worth
    it! Ask the mission runner who's busy tractoring a wreck towards them, and I salvage
    the wreck right from within their grasp!\u201D \n\nOwnership of the salvage is
    what seems to be the key argument from both sides. M\u2019ing Pai stated that:
    \u201CI firmly believe that the idea that the wrecks aren't owned by the mission
    runner or his corp is completely shaky\u2026 If you aren't a member of that runner's
    corp or gang, you can't tractor it\u2026 If you _shoot_ it, and you're not a member
    of the runner's corporation or the runner himself, CONCORD comes to defend against
    an aggressive act against someone else's _property_.\u201D \n\nTchell is quick
    to point out that: \u201CIf this was some type of theft, I\u2019m certain the
    CONCORD Constabulary would come knocking on my door!\u201D \n\nDespite the frustration
    of mission runners throughout New Eden, salvage has so far been deemed to have
    no ownership; thus legitimizing Ninja Salvage as a profession that some deem \u201Ceven
    lower\u201D than ore thievery. With the recent rise of battlefield wrecks due
    to Militia activities, ninja salvagers have even been known to follow militia
    fleets around in the hopes of grabbing some scraps. This activity has added even
    more confusion to militia fights as overview settings become filled with \"neutral\"
    ships mixed in with hostiles."
