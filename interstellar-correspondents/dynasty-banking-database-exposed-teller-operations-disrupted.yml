    Hek -** Dynasty Banking [DB] may never recover from the security flaw that completely
    shut down teller activities earlier this month, sources within the bank confirmed.
    \ \n  \nOn June 14th, a critical vulnerability exposed Dynasty Banking's entire
    database for several hours. Given the nature of the vulnerability, the entire
    set of data was considered tainted and subsequently removed by [DB] technicians.
    An anonymous source described the severity of the situation using these words:
    \"Account balances, sensitive customer data, transactions, everything. It was
    all there...\"[![Dynasty Banking HeadQuarter in Hek](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3151/dynastyhqthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F3151%2Fdynastyhq.png)
    \ \n  \nFollowing initial reassurances of a prompt recovery, Dynasty Banking's
    management has since gone silent and it is presently unknown whether ISK withdrawals
    are being honored at all. Exec Order, Head of Dynasty Banking's Investments confirmed
    all personnel are still waiting for an update from their CEO. While he still hopes
    they can push through this difficult time he also says: \"I am beginning to get
    concerned since I am getting no response from Manalapan.\"  \n  \nDynasty Banking's
    solvency also appears to be in question. Unconfirmed rumors indicate that Manalapan
    had initially tried to honour widthrawal requests, but had run into \"problems.\"
    \ \n  \nLaVista Vista, a well known industrialist in some circles, believes Dynasty
    Banking has been facing a liquidity crisis since Xabier's scam. He believes the
    bank could have avoided the present situation: \"[DB] biggest flaw was the lack
    of actual communication... Had [bank's management] gone out and assured it's customers
    that everything was fine, they might have prevented a sizeable run on the bank\",
    he says.  \n  \nShar Tegral, former Dynasty Banking auditor, gives more insight
    on the alleged liquidity issues: \"[a few days ago, Ebank's CEO] took an emergency
    call from Manalapan... even though [Dynasty Banking] was offline Manalapan was
    trying to manually process depositor withdrawal requests and had finally hit the
    liquidity wall... [Dynasty Banking] was asking for assistance from eBank... [but]
    given the lack of collateral, the managing of the crisis that Manalapan had failed
    to do, and their own recent troubles... eBank decided to refuse such a request\".
    \ \n  \nAs the days go by, Dynasty Banking customers are growing worried. Salpad,
    a bank's customer, says: \"I hope things will work out, but I'm not optimistic\".
    Packtu'sa, another customer, echoes: \"it is clear that [Dynasty Banking] is not
    handling this in a reasonable manner.\" RiverSena adds that this has even shaken
    his confidence in banking as a whole: \"I will never use another bank again. Unless
    [Dynasty Banking] comes back and I get access to my cash I'm done with banks.\"
    \ \n  \n[DB] employees share customers' worries too. Exec Order gives a picture
    of the mixed moods amongst staff: \"imagine how our day-to-day staff feels, several
    of them have put more than a year's worth of time into this. We are not quite
    ready to toss in the towel, but we are also very concerned.\"  \n  \nAt the time
    the security flaw was discovered, the bank had 879 customers and roughly 645 Billions
    between regular accounts and Certificates of Deposit. According to Shar Tegral,
    of the 879 open accounts, the majority show figures of 1 Billion ISK or less,
    meaning that an eventual default will hit hard among those with medium to small
    savings.  \n  \nIt is still uncertain whether Dynasty Banking will default or
    liquidate it's remaining assets. Interstellar Correspondents will continue monitoring
    the situation and report on any further development.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected
