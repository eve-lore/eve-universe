    Heimatar** \\- The Hulkageddon II event, in which pilots competed to destroy the
    most Exhumer-grade mining vessels over the course of a single week, came to a
    close on the 14.01.112 with a claimed 1,220 Exhumers destroyed. The top prize
    of 3 billion ISK was awarded to The United, with Final Agony and The Bastards
    claiming the 1 billion ISK award for second place and the 500 million ISK for
    third, respectively.   \n  \n[![CONCORD SWAT Battleships in Nakugard Icebelt](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3668/conc1thumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F3668%2Fconc1.png)Hulkageddon
    II's organizer, Helicity Boson, has hailed the event as \"a resounding success
    beyond my highest expectations!\" Over 800 pilots are recorded as having participated,
    racking up almost 1800 registered kills, some 275 billion ISK-value in damage
    done and the loss of some estimated 100 - 250 thousand crewmen's lives.   \n  \nReactions
    to the event have been wildly varied amongst the capsuleer community.   \n  \nAeCha
    Anais of Cold Fusion Alliance protested SCC authorization of insurance payouts
    to those attackers who lost their vessels to CONCORD in the course of illegal
    assaults such as those committed during Hulkageddon II.   \n  \n\"It is not surprising
    to me that capsuleers are willing to sacrifice [their crewmembers'] lives as regrettably
    many of my kind have become immune to the plight of their crews and the crews
    of the ships they attack. What is surprising to me is that SCC (secure commerce
    commission) is subsidizing this atrocity at almost 100% to all the attacking ships.\"
    \  \n  \nImagonnawhupya is a pilot who joined the corporation Hulkageddon Orphanage
    especially the event - the corporation was sponsored by Helicity Boson to give
    lone pilots wanting to take part an easier way of finding fleets to work with.
    He explained his feelings about the event very simply.   \n  \n\"This has been
    a great event. I know I had fun if my victims did not.\"   \n  \nEven among industrialists,
    however, there were those who enjoyed the event. Nysse Alpha of Forward Thinking
    Industries gave her views.   \n  \n\"As a miner... I thoroughly enjoyed Hulkageddon
    II. My Hulk was safely parked in spacedock for the duration, but I found the whole
    event to be quite entertaining, and checked the killboards every day to see the
    Exhumer loses of all the window-lickers who thought they were safe, or thought
    they could out-tank the gank squads.   \n  \n\"Look forward to the next one.\"
    \  \n  \nThough Hulkageddon II is now officially over and the prizes awarded,
    suicide attacks against miners continue to occur and many industrialists still
    vociferously protest that no action was taken to stop the event. The Interstellar
    Correspondents will look more at the feelings raised by Hulkageddon in a forthcoming
    article.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Hulkageddon II Closure Announcement and
