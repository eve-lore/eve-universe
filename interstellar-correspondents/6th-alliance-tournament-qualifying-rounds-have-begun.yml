    Despite what many pod pilots felt was going to be an Ishtar vs. Ishtar tournament,
    the first 16 teams have fielded a wide variety of ships including marauders and
    frigates.


    Several teams have already fielded specific-class ships in their fleets. Most
    notable were Against ALL Authorities'' team of nine Fleet Issue Stabbers and a
    single Claymore, and Cult of War''s team of eight Caracal Navy Issues and a pair
    of Lachesis cruisers.


    Electronic warfare was used extensively as well, as demonstrated by the use of
    tracking disruptors and a large swarm of electronic warfare drones deployed by
    Dead Terrorists on their win against Alternative Reality.


    Coverage will continue throughout the event and full match reports can be found
    on [GalNet](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=981389
