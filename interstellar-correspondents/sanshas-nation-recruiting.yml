    Heimatar** \u2013 On Wednesday, Citizen Astur appeared in the Pator system and
    exchanged words with capsuleer Drake Arson, a long-time Sansha supporter, and
    asked \u201Care you ready to join with us?\u201D Citizen Astur quickly formed
    a wormhole which took Drake Arson to Nation's home region in Stain.   \n  \n[![Drake

    A capsuleer task force quickly assembled and responding managed to destroy Citizen
    Astur\u2019s Revenant, after which Citizen Arson re-emerged from the wormhole
    piloting a Hel Supercarrier and re-engaged the capsuleer force. The task force
    of 80+ pilots managed to defeat Citizen Arson, his last words included, \u201CI
    can return there whenever I please\u201D.   \n  \nAttempting to contact former
    pilot Drake Arson, he had only these words: \u201CCitizen Arson is Nation. I am
    Nation. We are one.\u201D   \n  \nGhost Hunter, a well known Sansha supporter
    and CEO of True Slave Foundations, portrayed the event as \u201Cbeautiful\u201D.
    He said: \u201CBrother Arson's work has proved invaluable and I am glad he has
    found home in Nation.\u201D   \n  \nWhile ISD Tedra Kerrigan was the first reported
    capsuleer to be pulled into Sansha\u2019s ranks, Drake Arson is the first Sansha
    supporter and willing convert to join Nation. [![Citizen Arson Engaged](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4732/4732-1thumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4732/4732-1.png)
    \  \n  \n\u201CBig or small, weak or strong, all are unified within Nation. Together,
    there is no obstacle that cannot be overcome.\u201D These are the words of True
    Slave Foundations. Such devout worship may sooner or later draw further supporters
    into the grasp of Nation.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[ISD Tedra Kerrigan cloned
