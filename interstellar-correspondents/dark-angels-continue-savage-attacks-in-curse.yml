- body: "CURSE. The last few days have seen an alarming resurgence in reports of Dark
    Angels hostilities in the troubled southern region, with some victimized pilots
    now claiming that the sheer organizational lethality of the corporation suggests
    something deeper is amiss. \n\nThe attacks came in the same manner as before,
    either victims were lured in by a fake distress signal, or they were ruthlessly
    engaged wherever they were found. Attempts to communicate with the pilots were
    met with silence. \n\n\u201CI was traveling through to Utopia in my Buzzard,\u201D
    remarked one luckily unscathed individual who requested to be unnamed, \u201CAnd
    suddenly as I was approaching the next system jump, five stealth bombers uncloaked
    all around the gate, one of them only 4 kilometers away from me. I got out fast.\u201D
    Most were not so lucky, with the Dark Angels Corporation already claiming many
    lives during their short but violent sorties, including pod pilots from the corporations
    Jericho Fraction and Legio Nova Invicta as well as more recently two capsuleers
    from the alliance Veritas Immortalis \n\nIntriguing reports have filtered in about
    the mysterious group of Stealth Bombers. \u201CThey were efficient and disciplined\u2026you
    have to be a pretty damn good pilot to fly a stealth gang like that,\u201D remarked
    Taes Valkiir of Jericho Fraction, whose Blackbird-class cruiser was one of the
    first ships to come under the merciless fire of the Dark Angels unit. \u201CHounds.
    At least that's what CONCORD claims\u201D she stated in reference to her combat
    loss report. \n\n\u201CAs far as I saw they had top-of-the-line equipment,\u201D
    remarked Lorenzo, speaking on behalf of Legio Nova Invicta about the loss of one
    of his comrades to the well-equipped force. \u201CHe was killed by their gang
    without any word\u201D. It was their impression that the Dark Angels \u201Cweren't
    pursuing a precise objective, against [them] or any other corporation in the area\u201D.
    Justifying his impression, Lorenzo said simply \u201CTheir movements were quite
    random\u2026they seemed to be after targets of opportunity\u2026their behavior
    was quite strange.\u201D His report was a stark contrast to the unity attributed
    to them by Ms Valkiir, perhaps suggesting that the Legio pilots overwhelming numbers
    broke down the unity and organization of the small group. \n\nSomething has been
    unearthed by the analysis of the wreckage recovered by CONCORD from the CL-85V
    system, where Legio Nova Invicta pilots avenged the loss of erConte\u2019s Taranis
    to the marauding bombers. CONCORD investigators were initially very outspoken
    about the findings, labelling them as \u201Cevidence of a much larger involvement\u201D
    and promising full disclosure to the public once the analysis was finalised. However,
    many weeks after, their investigation seems to be drawing endlessly onwards, or
    as some speculate, it has been silenced. \n\nMany observers have noted with suspicion,
    the similarity in tactics used by the Dark Angels and those used by certain facets
    of the Angel Corporation. The cold-blooded ferocity of the attacks, the organizational
    professionalism and tactical prowess they have displayed, and most importantly,
    the Dark Angels apparent expertise on the geography of the region \u2013 all of
    which suggests a larger involvement. \n\nSome are hesitant to conclude Angel involvement,
    Ms Valkiir herself was doubtful, saying only \u201CI figured the cartel would
    be smarter than that.\u201D Others disagree, pointing simply to the name of the
    corporation itself, bearing within it the feared name, \u201CAngels\u201D. Lorenzo
    echoed the sentiments of many in stating, \u201CYou will agree that if you look
    at their corp name, a connection between them and some Angel forces is quite normal.\u201D
    That these puzzling actions have occurred exclusively within the Angel Corporation\u2019s
    theatre of operation has only further fuelled this particular line of speculation,
    creating significant pressure for the organization to respond.\n\nAngel Corporation
    officials were initially willing to partake in an interview commenting on the
    matter, until a pre-interview brief outlining these speculations brought about
    a prompt cancellation."
