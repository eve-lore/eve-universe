    pilot feels that the isk value of goods is an artificial value; that value is
    something that only the owner can give to the item. \n\nTradesalotski explains:
    \u201CI believe that we place too much emphasis on the value of money, and people
    perspectives need to change. We forget the real value of an item is what we give
    it. I think one of the biggest problems in New Eden is the emphasis placed upon
    isk. The pursuit of isk often means that you lose sight of what is important \u2026having
    a laugh, and deciding what is important.\u201D \n\nTo illustrate how value is
    in the eye of the beholder Tradesalotski points to is first trade; \u201CMy first
    trade was my exotic dancer for an Iteron Mark III. The person who I traded with
    had a -9.9 security rating, so for him having a ship in empire space was useless.\u201D
    At current isk prices, this trade was far from even at a 50x value in Tradesalotski\u2019s
    favor. \n\nHis most unusual trade was for a tomb in Azia Burgi\u2019s [cemetery](http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=1937&tid=7);
    \u201CI traded my Mackinaw with Azia Burgi for a place in her graveyard. The tomb
    would be unique and personalised unlike any others that were there already.\u201D
    The tomb was eventaully traded for a fitted and rigged Firetail. \n\nTradesalotski
    adds: \u201CIn an ideal world I would like to trade in commodities which are not
    available on the market. For example\u2026whilst the grave had no isk value the
    uniqueness and the experience meant that it did have value for someone. I would
    love to see some more trades like this taking place.\u201D \n\nAlthough Tradesalotski
    may like to see more bartering type trades in New Eden, Selene D\u2019Celeste,
    a board member of EBANK had this to say: \n\n\u201CA barter system, based on good-to-good
    transactions, works on the micro-level where two individuals just happen to be
    able to benefit each other though an item-based trade. Such a system doesn't scale
    up well in New Eden. Since we place value on goods individually, there is no guarantee
    that when I want Item X from Person Y that they will desire something I own that
    could be traded for Item X. This is why money is important. By having an object
    that represents neutral wealth (ISK), and having somewhat stable ranges of value
    associated with physical items, we have a much more flexible system that allows
    more goods to flow and more ability to leverage the value of goods, which is good
    for all involved. The more trade, the more profits and opportunities for profit.
    Bartering is a useful option often forgotten, but it's certainly not a replacement
    for currency.\u201D"
