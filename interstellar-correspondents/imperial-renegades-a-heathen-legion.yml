    \ \nThe aim of Heathen Legion in the words of Kazzzi, is to, \u201Cfight Amarrian
    Imperialism, and hope to one see reform in the Amarr Empire.\u201D   \n  \nKazzzi
    also wished to remind New Eden of the Amarrian Cost, often forgotten given the
    sheer numbers of Minmatar in slavery. \u201CIn connection with the Ushra'Khan's
    goals of freedom, people often overlook the many slaves of Amarrian blood in the
    Empire.\u201D   \n  \nThe corporation was nominated for \"[The 112 Amarrian Loyalist
    of the Year Awards, Sponsored by PIE Inc.\" Ugleb of Ushra'Khan placed a vote
    for Heathen Legion, for \u201Cthe bold and noble pursuit of widespread reform
    within the Empire, in both domestic and foreign policy.\" Though the nomination
    was never likely to lead anywhere, Kazzzi commented \u201CThough I do believe
    New Eden would be a dreary place without satire, I do feel pity and sorrow for
    the innocent who suffer under the iron fist of the Empire.\u201D \n\n* * *\n\nAre
