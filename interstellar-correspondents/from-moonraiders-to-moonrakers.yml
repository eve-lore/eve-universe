    Stein, a director of STYX. shared his feelings about the past failures and eventual
    success; _\"We took heavy losses on [our] previous attempt[s] as you know, but
    our spirit was not broken. We were determined and came a lot more prepared...[We
    brought] more [of] everything, including more friends, the fleet was close to
    150 pod pilots in different ship sizes and roles\"_\n\nA lot of effort has gone
    into securing this dysprosium moon for STYX. When asked why, Stein told us, _\"Any
    effort to decrease RA ability to sustain long term war is worth it, no matter
    the cost. Losing 2 motherships so quickly always create[s] some effect, but was
    quickly overcome by the spirit of everyone involved.\"_\n\nIt may have taken them
    them a few attempts and a few billion ISK's worth of ships but STYX. have now
    taken one of the most profitable moons in New Eden, thus giving a major income
    boost to their alliance. More important to them however, is that they have deprived
    their enemy of a great prize.\n\n_Interstellar Correspondents will keep you up
    to date with any further development_"
