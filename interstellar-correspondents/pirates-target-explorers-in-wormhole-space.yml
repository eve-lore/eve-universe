    sparked by the emergence of the mysterious and unpredictable wormholes, there
    has been an increase in acts of aggression upon 'Targets of Opportunity' by pirate
    and mercenary corporations.\n\n[![What Lies Beyond...](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2932/wormholethumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F2932%2Fwormhole.png)The
    threat of piracy is growing daily. Pirate and Mercenary corporations all over
    New Eden are roaming within the boundaries of these new cosmic signatures, using
    their shadow to trap the unwary. Some of these are even choosing to make these
    places home, preying on those who enter the uncharted systems. The threat of piracy
    in Empire space has been tempered by CONCORD in the past, but with the emergence
    of wormholes, the threat has been renewed and the unwary are falling victim.\n\nThere
    are pilots who inhabit the vast expanse of space not protected by CONCORD. Many
    must live in these regions because their crimes have made it impossible to enter
    CONCORD protected space without dire consequences. Some of these pilots may now
    be as close to Empire as the entrance to the nearest wormhole. Even as those Industrialists
    and explorers who would explore the wormholes were preparing to do so, these pirates
    were making preparations as well.  \n\nAccording to MirrorGod, CEO of Heretic
    Army, \"When the first news from GalNet came in of these cosmic appearances, only
    minutes later were our pilots producing the launchers and probes necessary to
    find them, within the hour, we'd found our first wormhole next door.\"  He continues,
    \"...20 odd of our pilots attended [entering the wormhole]. We did quite a job
    against the sleeper resistance and managed to strike blood on the other explorers
    as well.\"\n\nRedSplat, a member of Heretic Army, replies when asked about how
    targets are identified, \"If ships are identified on scan that aren't in fleet,
    they are probed out and eliminated...\" He continues, \"[the wormholes] have been
    bubbled, [capsuleers] ransomed and offered a route out for ISK if their fleet's
    covops ship [is destroyed].\"\n\nWhile it appears that some who would explore
    the wormholes, and harvest the treasures that lie therein, are uneasy and in some
    cases ill-prepared for the unpredictable nature of wormhole entry and exit points,
    these pirates do not share these concerns and in fact, are quite comfortable with
    the phenomenon.\n\n\"Wormhole operations came natural, we're well adjusted to
    a nomadic brand of piracy.\" states CEO MirrorGod. When asked about the future
    of wormhole exploration, he concludes, \"...as time goes on and as the hype surrounding
    these new cosmic anomalies settle, I certainly intend on using them to make things
    less safe for those who believe they can hide behind a secure star-gate.\"\n\n
