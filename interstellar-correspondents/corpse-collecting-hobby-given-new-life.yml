    Genesis -** [Following on from our recent story about el caido and his attempt
    to collect one million corpses](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=4007&tid=7),
    Macabre Devil has come forward to explain why he also enjoys collecting corpses.
    \  \n  \nMacabre started his collection as he thought it would be something different.
    \"I was making quite a bit of ISK and was trying to think of something to spend
    it on. The thought crossed my mind that collecting corpses could be something
    unique.\"   \n  \nMacabre explained that he is willing to pay a lot more ISK on
    each corpse than el caido currently offers. Whereas el caido currently pays 10,000
    ISK per corpse, Macabre Devil offers 500,000 ISK for male corpses and 1,000,000
    ISK for each female corpse. According to Macabre, female corpses are much rarer
    than male ones as female capsuleers are less common than their male compatriots.
    \  \n  \nMacabre Devil states he currently has two to three thousand corpses,
    with roughy only a quarter of them being female. With no target in mind of how
    many he will collect, Macabre said \"I just wish to keep collecting them as long
    as I have the ISK. I do intend to catolog whose corpses I have eventually as well.\"
    \  \n  \nWith this being the second article in a short space of time regarding
    the strange hobby, Macabre expressed his understanding of the feelings other capsuleers
    may have towards it. \"They might be taken aback at first, and make jokes about
    what I keep them for, but I generally think it is just [a] different way to spend
    one's ISK. Particularly if they have some corpses as well and didn't know what
    to do with them.\"\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this article?
