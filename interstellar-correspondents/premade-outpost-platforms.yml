- body: "**Evolving Markets -** Thousands of items trade hands on GalNet daily. Most
    items are relatively easy to build and are aimed at the average pod pilot. One
    pilot on GalNet has decided to try something different; create a product that
    is both time and resource consuming to build, and offer it for auction to the
    alliance that has the funds and space to deploy it. \n\nAn Outpost Platform can
    cost anywhere from 25 to 30 billion isk to build. Purchasing and transporting
    the goods, as well as the time involved in mining minerals, can be a daunting
    and time consuming task. With auctions like Dylon Xavier\u2019s, which include
    a freighter to move the \u201Cegg\u201D, alliances with established sovereignty
    will be able to deploy outposts within days of the decision to build one. \n\nAn
    alliance outpost builder told us that \u201CIt saves a lot of time moving parts
    and doing an investigation into the exact region to find the parts.\u201D As for
    the opening bid amount, he says \u201CI would pay up to 4 billion extra myself
    but I can understand that people who are less rich would find 2 billion over the
    build cost is more suitable.\u201D \n\nAlthough this kind of product can be a
    great timesaver, the anonymous builder tells us that \u201CBuilding an outpost
    is still something special\u2026a group effort, a goal, something to be proud
    of with blood sweat and tears; having it ready-made takes away from that in my
    opinion.\u201D \n\nThe outcome of this auction may lead to a new industry of professional
    outpost builders catering to a very small niche market. \n\n* * *\n\n[Original
