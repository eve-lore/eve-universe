- body: "The **Fifth Alliance Tournament** is almost upon us. This year\u2019s entrants
    include a number of new, smaller and mostly unknown alliances as well as the established
    tournament veterans. \n\nNext in our series of alliance introductions, we present
    _**Divine 0rder**_\n\n**Divine 0rder (DOA)**\n\n* * *\n\nWith only a few days
    to go before the first shots are fired, pilots across the cluster are cleaning
    their guns and tweaking their fits, caught in a frenzy of last moment preparation.
    One alliance that seems to have everything in hand, however, is Divine 0rder,
    affectionately known as DOA. \n\nDivine 0rder is a new face on the alliance scene,
    formed only on the first of this year. Grappler, a director of DOA\u2019s executor
    corporation, Divine Retribution and member of the alliance council, explained
    to me that their relative newness doesn't represent their overall experience.
    \n\n\u201CMost of our members have been in alliances or corps together for years.
    We have been flying together since the Great Northern War, for the most part.\u201D
    \n\nDivine 0rder and Divine Retribution should be names familiar to many who have
    sought the aid of mercenaries, or been on the receiving end of their punitive
    declarations. One of their more well known campaigns was waged against Privateer
    Alliance \u2013 a heated conflict against one of the cluster\u2019s more pervasive
    military forces, which Divine 0rder carried off with relatively few losses. \n\nThe
    mercenaries chose Deklein as their operational base, pointing out the numerous
    opportunities for employment there. They\u2019ve seen many battles there against
    R0ADKILL alliance \u2013 who are in Group H of this year\u2019s tournament. \n\nWhen
    asked why Divine 0rder entered the tournament this year, grappler remarked: \n\n\u201C[We
    want] to test ourselves against the best the other alliances have to offer. In
    most fights, we tend to get outnumbered, so it will be nice to fight with fairly
    even numbers against people who want to win as badly as we do. \n\n\u201CAnd the
    shiny ships you can win are nice.\" \n\nIn the event of victory, grappler suggested
    that they will have a small, inter-corporation tournament to decide which prizes
    they will take, with the winner having first pick. \n\nDOA have picked their final
    roster for the tournament, but are keeping their chosen pilots\u2019 identities
    carefully concealed until the match itself. \n\n\u201CSkill sets and fleet composition
    determine who we use with which round, [and we] can\u2019t let anyone scout us.\u201D
    \n\nWhile grappler said that she is keen for the chance to fight R0ADKILL in the
    tournament, the team they have really set their caps for is Mercenary Coalition.
    She sees them as a difficult challenge with some truly excellent pilots to pit
    her alliance against, as well as a group they have never yet had the chance to
    face in the field. \n\n\u201C[We don\u2019t know what tactics they might use]
    as of yet, but we won\u2019t see them for several rounds, so we will be watching
    closely.\u201D \n\nAnother tough contest is anticipated from their very first
    fight, against Atlas Alliance; some DOA members have flown both with and against
    Atlas, and rate them as a solid opponents. To plan against the opening match,
    however, will be difficult, as grappler explains: \n\n\u201CWe have a few setups
    we will use, but it\u2019s going to be hard to set up for one specific group...I\u2019m
    sure all involved will have more than one fleet set up, otherwise it would be
    easy to prepare for them.\u201D \n\nIf Divine 0rder were to secure a triumph in
    the tournament, grappler anticipates a big boost in mercenary contracts for the
    alliance. However, she said that their recruitment, while perhaps gaining more
    pilots to choose from, will not go up in real terms. \n\n\u201CI would think we
    would have a fairly large boost in business, and the law of supply and demand
    would say our rates would go up, so that\u2019s good for our pilots\u2019 wallets\u2026
    We are very selective with our recruiting though. Quality over quantity.\u201D
    \n\nSo there we have it. A team hand-picked from the very best mercenaries DOA
    have to offer, looking to prove themselves in edge-of-the-seat battles against
    some of the cluster\u2019s finest pilots, from old rivals to figures of aspiration.
    \n\n...And win some nice shiny ships, or course. \n\n* * *\n\n_More coverage will
    be available live during the tournament. As mentioned above Divine 0rder's first
    match is against Atlas Alliance on Day One._"
