    to the Alliance Tournament Team Spotlight, where we take a closer look at some
    of the teams competing in the [Alliance Tournament XIV](https://community.eveonline.com/community/alliance-tournament/).
    Today, we are shining the spotlight on [404 Alliance Not Found](https://gate.eveonline.com/Alliance/404%20Alliance%20Not%20Found)
    [U-WOT], who also participated in last year's Alliance Tournament XIII.\n\n![](http://imageserver.eveonline.com/Alliance/99004222_128.png)\n\nAlthough
    this is only the second time 404 Alliance Not Found has fielded an Alliance Tournament
    team, several of their members have been in previous Tournaments multiple times
    with other alliances.\n\nIn YC117, 404 Alliance Not Found were defeated in both
    their matches, by Vox Populi. in the first, and Drop the Hammer in the second.
    According to team member [Heimotz](https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Heimotz),
    they were \"curbstomped, but it was still a lot of fun. Both matches we were countered
    and wrecked, we did fine, the other teams just crushed us. We picked Paper, they
    picked Scissors.\" He went on to say, however, that \"our goal last year was fun,
    this year the same goal. We had fun last year, and will have more fun this year.\"\n\nWe
    asked Heimatz about his opinion of their chances. \"To win it all? Nil. At some
    point wealth and size give teams a real advantage. We're very small, and use a
    lot of our time on corporation matters, can't dedicate a lot of time to making
    many comps and practice. We don't own any AT ships to pull out, and our budget
    for flagship is laughably low. Still, advancing in the brackets isn't out of the
    question, and it's just more fun to have!\"\n\nRecordings from previous tournaments:\n\n[Vox
    Populi. vs 404 Alliance Not Found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJe70VQU9XM)
    (AT XIII, Day 1)  \n[Drop the Hammer vs 404 Alliance Not Found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1ELAIUYLqQ)
    (AT XIII, Day 2)\n\nWe at the IC wish all teams the best of luck in the upcoming
    Alliance Tournament!\n\n \n\n* * *\n\nGot something newsworthy?  \nCome join us
