    Capsuleers\n\nAfter two weekends of explosions and last minute victories, we are
    now in the third week of Alliance Tournament XV. If you missed the action from
    the first two weekends of the tournament, you can find matches on [EVE_NT's YouTube
    channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm-9ale5rFH4d5ntshgJTYA/playlists?sort=dd&view=50&shelf_id=20),
    as well as simulation replays of every single match at <https://eveonline.pvp.tools/alliance-tournament/>
    (Shout out to Bierkof for putting it together). A big thank you also goes out
    to everyone at EVE_NT from CCP for all their hard work during the first two weekends
    of the tournament.\n\nWhile 40 teams have already been eliminated, 24 teams remain
    in the tournament. Eight of these teams are in the undefeated bracket, having
    managed to defeat every team they have faced so far. They are:\n\n  * A Band Apart.\n
    \ * Exodus.\n  * L A Z E R H A W K S\n  * Northern Coalition.\n  * Pen Is Out\n
    \ * The Initiative.\n  * The Tuskers Co.\n  * VYDRA RELOLDED\n\n\n\nThe remaining
    16 teams in the elimination bracket have all stumbled briefly and lost at least
    one match, but are managing to hang on and forge a path through other teams in
    a bid to reach the finals. They are:\n\n  * Brave Collective\n  * Bright Side
    of Death\n  * HYDRA RELOADED\n  * Mercenary Coalition\n  * Pandemic Legion\n  *
    Rote Kapelle\n  * Salt Farmers\n  * Shadow Cartel\n  * skill urself\n  * Snuffed
    Out\n  * Solyaris Chtonium\n  * Test Alliance Please Ignore\n  * The Bastard Cartel\n
    \ * THE R0NIN\n  * Thermodynamics\n  * WE FORM V0LTA\n\n\n\n[The full brackets
    for the tournament can be found here.](https://community.eveonline.com/community/alliance-tournament/tournament-brackets/)\n\nThe
    third weekend of Alliance Tournament XV starts August 12 at 15:00 UTC on <https://twitch.tv/ccp>
    with THE R0NIN versus Snuffed Out. [The full match schedule is available here
    on the community website](https://community.eveonline.com/community/alliance-tournament/schedule/).
    We'll be brining you every match live from the studio in CCP Iceland alongside
    our expert commentators who you have already heard with EVE_NT. We asked them
    what they thought were some of the highlights of the last two weeks of play and
    what matches they're looking forward to this weekend.\n\nRahne Chocolate: _My
    highlight match was definitely[Solyaris Chtonium vs No Handlebars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-X3KNHyqFI&index=15&list=PLmAI6Ao-2HlY9pD_0FEBNQLMOkt_dmbo2),
    featuring expert MJD usage by Panthone. After watching their performance in the
    first two weekends, I'm looking forward to their upcoming matches, especially
    their first match on Saturday against Pandmeic Legion. It will be a super exciting
    thanks to SLYCE's unpredictable nature._\n\nElise Randolph: _My highlight from
    this weekend was definitely the tournament micro jump unit. While the unit has
    been in the AT for years, this weekend we saw them finally used to great effect.
    Most notably in the matches involving SLYCE, as they had a pilot single handedly
    winning the match versus drone swarms. This lead to an increased importance in
    scram tackle frigates - standout performance by Wasa QC in this role. I 'm really
    excited to see the juggernauts clash in the elimination bracket - with tournament
    winners Hydra, PL, R0nin, and V0lta. PL and hydra have a 50-50 record, with PL
    winning in elimination matches historically._\n\nMawderator: _One of the highlights
    for me so far this tournament was[The Bastard Cartel vs Ghost Legion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IykLFvoPos&index=14&list=PLmAI6Ao-2HlbD0mWgeHjvb-94-MAR7Fs-).
    Ghost Legion managed to take a small but seemingly solid lead in the match, but
    with less than a minute left TBC managed to start getting kills. In the end, TBC
    managed to pull ahead with just 21 seconds left, and hang on with their own ship
    with just 16% structure remaining. I'm eager to see which of the teams from the
    lower half of the undefeated bracket will make it to the undefeated finals, as
    these are teams that largely haven't been able to make it that far in the tournament
    before. Who will get a shot at the final day?_\n\nJin 'taan: _The highlight match
    for me has to be[A Band Apart. vs WE FORM V0LTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjMmwTzyY6I&index=8&list=PLmAI6Ao-2HlbD0mWgeHjvb-94-MAR7Fs-),
    which for me really showed the impact individual piloting can have in the tournament,
    from ABA's Logi pilot, to Tikktok in the interceptor, all making these little
    minute plays that drastically changed the flow of the match, all topped off with
    a split-second decision on the Blackbird pilot to keep momentum in ABA's favour.
    I'm looking forward to the upcoming match between skill urself and Rote Kapelle,
    as the captains of both teams (CapQu and Ben Booley) are bitter rivals, so both
    can be expected to bring everything they have to try and drive the other out of
    the tournament. Both teams are gearing up for this fight, so expect them to bring
    everything they have to the table._\n\nSomething else to note with the third and
    fourth weekends is that teams will now have the ability to ban up to three ships
    instead of just two. This is a big change for the tournament, and is sure to result
    in some changes in strategy by the teams competing.\n\nWhich matches are you looking
    forward to? Who do you think will win the tournament now that we 've seen what
    teams can bring to the table? Tweet to us using the hashtag #ATXV and let us know.
    We're just as excited to see what unfolds over the next two weekends as you are,
    and we hope to see you in twitch chat cheering for your team (or cheering against
    your nemesis's team). Until then fly safe!\n\n-CCP Logibro and the Tournament
    Team"
