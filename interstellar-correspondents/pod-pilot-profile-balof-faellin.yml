- body: "This article will begin a series of monthly interviews with individual pod
    pilots. The purpose of which is to reach out beyond the most well known capsuleers
    and instead look at the \"common man\" (if any pod pilot can be indeed called
    \"common\"). We aim to question them about their backgrounds, accomplishments
    and goals and provide an insight into everyday life as one of the elite few known
    as \u201Ceggers\u201D. \n\nEarlier this week I was out in 9-4RP2 (Cloud Ring Region)
    and sat down with Balof Faelin in his plush office at one of the manufacturing
    stations there. Here follows a transcript of the interview: \n\n**Argooros Ployon:
    Tell us about your background.**\n\n**Balof Faelin:** I was born in Kakakela to
    lower class factory workers. Life was quite hard but we managed to make ends meet.
    As I grew up my talent for industry and merchandising was recognized and developed.
    Then I got some lucky breaks and with a bit of sacrifice was able to join the
    pod community. \n\n**AP: How long have you been a pod pilot?**\n\n**BF:** I've
    been plying the space lanes for over 4 years now. \n\n**AP: What organizations
    are you a member of?**\n\n**BF:** I am currently Industry Director with my corporation,
    Facta Non Verba. We are members of the Black Core Alliance. \n\n**AP: What is
    life like in your corporation/alliance?**\n\n**BF:** We are quite busy in Cloud
    Ring. We often have fleets from Triumvirate, Pure, and Bruce in the area looking
    for kills. Other than that, this is definitely a good alliance. It runs a Tech
    II replacement program for fleet battles, and an in-alliance store for all. \n\n**AP:
    Tell us about your training--what areas have you specialized in?**\n\n**BF:**
    I'm pretty much a jack-of-all-trades. I have good mining, refining, and building
    abilities; and I\u2019m not too bad on gunnery and missiles either. I do a bit
    of everything, including defending our space when necessary. \n\n**AP: As the
    industry director I am assuming that your work as a pod pilot focuses primarily
    on that area? Could you describe some of the work you do as an industrialist?**\n\n**BF:**
    I pretty much mine it, refine it, and build it. We have been doing tier 3 battleships
    recently, and I'm looking into moon-mining for us so we can compete in the Tech
    II component markets. \n\n**AP: Is there a recent event you would like to tell
    us about?**\n\n**BF:** We had a battle with Triumvirate recently next door in
    XZH-4X. Our fleet was gathering at a reconnaissance control tower there, and the
    Triumvirate fleet engaged us. They had many battleships and Tech II cruisers.
    Unfortunately, we didn't have the numbers at the time, and we came out on the
    losing end. I myself activated a new clone, which isn\u2019t unusual. \n\n**AP:
    How big an area out here do your people control?**\n\n**BF:** BCA, in conjunction
    with RECON, control most of Cloud Ring. \n\n**AP: What is your favorite ship?**\n\n**BF:**
    I'm quite in love with my Falcon just now. It is excellent for electronic warfare
    and for traveling around. \n\n**AP: That is all the questions I have. Do you want
    to make a closing comment?**\n\n**BF:** There are a lot of risks involved with
    0.0 living, but the rewards make it worthwhile. Get yourself out here and make
    some history."
