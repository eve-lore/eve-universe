    , **Heimatar**. Enigmatic Minmatar billionaire **Estel Arador** has recently celebrated
    the 10,000th capsuleer jump clone installation with his not-for-profit organization,
    Estel Arador's Corp Services [EACS].  \n  \nAt the corporate headquarters located
    in the Brutor Tribe Treasury, Rens IV, Arador broadcast a special message personally
    thanking all those who have contributed to the project. During the speech he urged
    every capsuleer to take advantage of their facilities: \"I'd like to thank everyone
    who has used the service so far, and encourage anyone who doesn't have a jump
    clone yet to go get them!\"  \n  \n[EACS] currently has access to cloning facilities
    in 1,092 stations; about 75% of all publicly available cloning facilities in New
    Eden. Locations include all four major trade hubs at Jita, Amarr, Rens and Dodoxie.
    \ \n  \nFueled by the relentless expansion of the capsuleer market and increased
    demand for jump clones over the last eighteen months, [EACS] and associates **Je'Nann**
    , **Contralto** , and **Incusus** have made steady progress. Now, almost two years
    after [launching their service](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=2661&tid=7),
    [EACS] has earned impressive standings with 49 of the largest mega corporations
    and have access to clone installations in some 27 regions.  \n  \nWhen asked if
    the organization would continue to penetrate the few remaining pockets of high,
    low and null security space yet to be fully exploited Arador was unequivocal:
    \"Its not a priority - but - it will continue to happen. Just at a slower pace.\"
    \ \n  \nHe also made it clear that there are no plans to capitalize on their achievements:
    \"I believe EACS offers an essential service to the capsuleer community, especially
    newly graduated capsuleers who often can't afford a multi-million isk fee. Therefore
    EACS will continue to offer its services free of charge to every capsuleer! No
    capsuleer left behind!\"  \n  \nTo make use of the [EACS] jump clone installation
    service a capsuleer need only possess some skill in Infomorph Psychology and adhere
    to [EACS] guidelines as published on GalNet.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Scientific
