    Metropolis** \\- Eve University [E-UNI], the well-known training corporation for
    new capsuleers, have changed their Rules of Engagement policy from NRDS [Not Red
    Don't Shoot] to NBSI [Not Blue Shoot It] in null-sec space and wormholes.   \n
    \ \nCEO Kelduum Revaan said: \"The change is something we have wanted to make
    for some time as flying NRDS in null-sec is unfortunately quite uncommon, and
    puts our members at a significant disadvantage when encountering neutrals in null-sec
    and w-space. So in a recent review of our Rules of Engagement we came to the conclusion
    that we now have sufficient standings set to deal with the majority of potential
    issues.\"   \n  \nThere has apparently been a number of minor incidents during
    the transition period, but according to Revaan, the number of training fleets
    heading into null-sec and wormhole space have increased, and Eve University looks
    forward to having many more classes on these topics in the future.   \n  \nRevaan
    confirmed that members are still not authorised to fire on haulers, mining barges
    or other non-combat vessels, and the corporation retains an open Non-aggression
    pact policy, so any group, regardless of previous conflicts with E-UNI may request
    blue standings.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this article? Do
