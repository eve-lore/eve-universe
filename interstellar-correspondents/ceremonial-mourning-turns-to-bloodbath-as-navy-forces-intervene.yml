    of life could remember the passing of Caldari Prime into Gallentean hands, turned
    into a bloodbath. After Jera, the CEO of the celebrated soft drinks manufacturer
    Drink Starsi\u2122, host and main speaker of the event, arrived and welcomed the
    participants, Gallente Navy vessels warped to the scene and opened fire on Jera\u2019s
    Industrial class vessel.   \n  \nWhile Yuki Li of Omerta Syndicate warned the
    Navy in local channels that further aggression would not be tolerated, others
    were already firing at the Gallentean ships, causing more and more navy ships
    to enter what was quickly becoming a battlefield. After it became clear that the
    Gallentean Navy was not going to back down, the Omerta Syndicate joined the fray.
    \  \n  \nAfter a mere thirty minutes of fighting, the Gallente Navy broke off
    the engagement. The battle ended in a shameful defeat of the Navy forces. Although
    there were some ships lost on the Caldari side, the casualties with the Gallentean
    Navy were far greater. It is rumoured that several Dominix battleships, together
    with a multitude of Vexor cruisers were destroyed. These reports are not yet confirmed
    by Gallentean officials.   \n  \nHowever, it can not be said that the attack by
    the Navy was entirely unprovoked. Jera\u2019s standing towards the Gallente Federation
    is negative to a point where she is considered a _persona non grata_ within Gallente
    borders. Drink Starsi\u2122\u2019s long-standing feud with the Quafe Company and
    rumoured strikes on Quafe transports are undoubtedly the cause of the Federation\u2019s
    intense dislike of her person.   \n  \nAlthough Jera is unavailable for comment
    at this time, we will try to contact her and get her side of the story. When or
    if we receive information from the Gallente Federation on the shameful defeat
    of their forces at Caldari Prime, we will report on it immediately."
