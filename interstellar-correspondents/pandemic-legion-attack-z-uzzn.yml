    a fleet but also believed that the station would be saved. He said: \u2018We have
    eyes in their staging system 24/7 so we know when they are forming up. Knowing
    PL they\u2019ll always come for a fight, win-win for everyone. We were expecting
    to save the station, or at least have a good fight in the process.\u2019[!['Z-U
    ATLAS LAZY HOUSE' in reinforced mode](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4453/z-uatlaslazyhouseinreinforcedmodethumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4453/z-uatlaslazyhouseinreinforcedmode.png)
    \  \n  \nWhen asked about .-A-. and allied forces relationship with -100, bl4xy
    said, \u2018we know PL isn\u2019t in this to control space and I doubt they want
    Querious. Everyone\u2019s in this for fights - tensions aren\u2019t any higher
    than between any other two enemies.\u2019   \n  \nIn closing, bl4xy stated: \u2018As
    always, great fun having a fleet fight, especially against decent opponents who
    can hold their own for a change.'   \n  \nElise Randolph, member of -100, explained
    the reasons for invading Z-UZZN: \u2018We reinforced the Z-UZZN system because
    it was close to them and close to us - a nice venue for both parties to have good
    fights.\u2019\u2019   \n  \nThere was a suspected combined loss of more than 400
    ships in the fight which saw the station go into reinforced mode and with both
    sides apparently eager for fights, further confrontations seem likely sooner than
    later.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Battle report](https://www.pandemic-legion.com/killboard/view_battle.php?start_time=2011-03-15%2017:57:00&end_time=2011-03-15%2018:31:00&system=Z-UZZN)\n\n*
