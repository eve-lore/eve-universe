    pre-emptive strike on Against ALL Authorities [.-A-.]'s staging system, GE-8JV,
    in an attempt to prevent its own space coming under siege as standings are changed.\n\nThe
    initial N3 attack saw them reinforce both the Infrastructure Hub (IHub) and outpost
    in the system with Sovereignty Blockade Units. On 2nd of November, the IHub exited
    reinforcement and saw local channel spike to over 3000 pilots as both sides attempted
    to hold whilst seemingly waiting for capital support.\n\nAs of November 3rd, GE-8JV's
    IHub and outpost have both exited their shield reinforcement timers and have been
    successfully repaired. Despite this, further hostilities are expected as both
    sides attempt to show their force should further political escalations between
    the two occur.\n\n###  GalNet References\n\n[Sovereignty guide](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sovereignty_%28Mechanics%29)\n\n[System
