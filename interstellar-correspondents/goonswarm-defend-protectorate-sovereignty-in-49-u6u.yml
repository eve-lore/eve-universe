- body: "**49-U6U, Querious** \\- Over the last few days, fierce fighting has continued
    in the system of 49-U6U as Goonswarm continue to hold the system against opposed
    forces.\n\nOn the 19th, the number of control towers in the system which had been
    claiming sovereignty for the required 7 days was [closely tied](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scrapheap-challenge.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fp%3D785883%23785883)
    between those contributing to GoonSwarm's sovereignty claim, and those contesting
    it in favour of KenZoku. Both KenZoku and Goonswarm had towers in reinforced mode
    that would become vulnerable again during the night.\n\nDuring the day, [dominance
    of the system](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scrapheap-challenge.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fp%3D786287%23786287)
    is currently claimed to be held by KenZoku, Against ALL Authorities, Skunk-Works
    and their allies, with the balance of power thought to swing to GoonSwarm, Pandemic
    Legion, the Northern Coalition and their allies in the period late evening to
    late morning.\n\nKenZoku and allies used their advantageous hours to [attack more
    control towers](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scrapheap-challenge.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fp%3D785883%23785883)
    and force them into reinforced mode, but GoonSwarm and their allies have been
    [using so-called \"Resistars\"](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scrapheap-challenge.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fp%3D785883%26sid%3Db5d51dd78cfa75d0f121fe1f2e84f758%23785883)
    \\- control towers with heavily hardened shields that take a very long time to
    cripple.\n\nWhen asked what KenZoku's objectives were in the system, Lady Scarlet
    gave an enigmatic \"No comment,\" but expressed an expectation for \"much pew
    pew\" in the coming weeks.\n\n#### 20:00 19.03.111 - GoonSwarm Tower Becomes Attackable
    \ \n\n\nThe first to emerge from reinforced mode was a GoonFleet tower at 20:00.
    Notoreus, a pilot in GoonSwarm's GoonFleet corporation, described the tense start
    to the evening:\n\n\"The battle that I suspected might occur didn't exactly happen.
    There was a Goonfleet tower coming out of reinforced at around 20:00. [Against
    ALL Authorities] had knocked this tower into reinforced the night before and with
    the tower destroyed, KenZoku would have a tower majority, effectively resetting
    GoonSwarm sovereignty.\"\n\n\"Due to the importance of the system, it was critical
    that GoonSwarm show up to defend. [Against ALL Authorities], KenZoku and a few
    other alliances managed to bring a large majority (local reached 1200) and were
    able to control the system while they knocked the tower down. The overwhelming
    majority of enemy pilots in system prevented any serious action, although there
    was the chance of a capital battle occuring.\"\n\nThe defenders attacked where
    opportunity arose, [luring attacking forces to a manned control tower](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scrapheap-challenge.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fp%3D785883%26sid%3Db5d51dd78cfa75d0f121fe1f2e84f758%23785883)
    and staging frequent sallies out of the shields to pick off enemies as they were
    wounded by the tower's armament and defenders who jump-bridged in atop their forces.
    They were, however, [unable to repair the vulnerable GoonFleet control tower](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scrapheap-challenge.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fp%3D785883%26sid%3Db5d51dd78cfa75d0f121fe1f2e84f758%23785883),
    which was destroyed and replaced by a KenZoku one.\n\nIf that was the only tower
    to die that night, [the ratio of sovereignty-claiming towers](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scrapheap-challenge.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fp%3D785883%23785883)
    would be 11:11 the next day and the system would become contested. But the night
    was far from over and the clock was ticking towards GoonSwarm's hours of dominance.
    By 22:00, GoonSwarm, Pandemic Legion, the Northern Coalition and their allies
    [outnumbered the attackers](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scrapheap-challenge.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fp%3D785883%26sid%3Db5d51dd78cfa75d0f121fe1f2e84f758%23785883)
    in 49-U6U and took their turn at repairing their own towers and putting their
    enemies' into reinforced mode.\n\n#### 02:00 20.03.111 - KenZoku Tower Becomes
    Attackable\n\nThe next important tower to become vulnerable was a KenZoku tower
    that ran out of Stronium Clathrates (the fuel required for reinforced mode) at
    02:00. At this time, GoonSwarm held clear dominance over the system and [destroyed
    the tower quickly](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scrapheap-challenge.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fp%3D786209%23786209).\n\nThis
    KenZoku tower was one of those that would have contributed to the next day's sovereignty
    claim check. Its demise meant that the ratio of claiming towers would be [11:10
    in favour of GoonSwarm](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scrapheap-challenge.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fp%3D786209%23786209).\n\nAgainst
    ALL Authorities attempted to re-group at 04:00, but the defenders had anticipated
    this, [crippling the offensive modules of the Against ALL Authorities rally tower
    and surrounding it in warp interdiction spheres](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scrapheap-challenge.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fp%3D786209%23786209),
    also known as \"bubbles\". GoonSwarm and their allies had 6 titans in the system
    and a heavy capital presence, against 100 hostiles - [hostile numbers dropped
    again quickly with little combat taking place](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scrapheap-challenge.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fp%3D786209%23786209).\n\n####
    12:00 20.03.111 - The Sovereignty Check  \n\n\nBy noon the next day, other towers
    had been put into reinforced or repaired, but the sovereignty balance held in
    Goonswarm's favour. [As of the 18th](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fevemaps.dotlan.net%2Fsystem%2F49-U6U),
    they have held Protectorate Sovereignty in the system.\n\nNotoreus gave his view
    on why the system was such a hotbed of activity:\n\n\"The system is a bit of a
    chokepoint and offers good cyno range to a number of Delve systems. However, the
    battle is primarily occurring due to this being the area where -A-/Kenzoku decided
    to push back and try to break Goonswarm efforts to achieve sovereignty level 3.\"\n\nSelest
    Cayal of Skunk-Works summed up his point of view of the battles:\n\n\"We have
    been fighting and both sides have lost and killed [ships and towers]... Most important,
    we are having fun.\"\n\nMore coverage of recent fighting to follow.\n\n#### GalNet
