    The alliance just one of many prominent coalitions to dissolve within recent weeks,
    reinforcing the current trend for large-scale dispersal and reformation of the
    universe\u2019s major capsuleer power blocs. \n\nThe decision of FE leadership
    to dissolve the alliance is being seen by many as part of a broader trend in universal
    alliance politics, highlighting a shift from large-scale alliances to smaller
    and often, more successful units. Whether or not the Forsaken Empire will follow
    that particular route is still unclear. \n\nSpeaking briefly, Pershphanie, ex-leader
    of FE, was unable to provide a clear picture on the future of the corporations,
    who only a few days ago were still united under one banner. \u2018Some corporations
    will be joining new alliances, and many will remain in the Vale of the Silent
    and Tribute Regions in one form or another.\u2019 When asked of the future of
    the two regions, she offered little further detail, saying only \u2018Who knows\u2026so
    much is unclear at this point I really can\u2019t answer.\u2019 \n\nFurther details
    about inter-corporation affairs at the time of the split suggest there may have
    been some pre-existing tensions between Forsaken Empire corporations, culminating
    in a decision to dissolve. According to the press release, the reason for this
    move was that \u201Cthings were getting too repetitive and not progressing fast
    enough\u201D. Pershphanie likened the situation in some ways to the Imperial Republic
    of the North\u2019s recent decision to separate, citing similar frustrations with
    the obstacles inherent in the maintenance of zero-sec regional claiming. \n\nProfessor
    Saula Pakasi, Sub-Dean of the Science and Trade Institute\u2019s Political Science
    Department, says the Forsaken Empire\u2019s situation and that of many other prominent
    alliances, suggests that in the medium to long-term, many pod-pilot alliances
    will be reshaped into smaller and potentially more nomadic entities. Her statements
    echo Pershphanie, who also sees a universal shift towards more nomadic alliances
    as a likely scenario. \n\nOthers disagree, many capsuleers voiced their opinions
    on universal communications networks, arguing the case that the future colonization
    of lawless space must be founded upon solid industrial and logistical frameworks,
    a reference in particular, to the maintenance of starbase technology."
