    of the Ushra'Khan, it also served the double duty of applying psychological pressure
    to Sylph Alliance in a bid to lower their morale.  \n  \nAccording to Ugleb, during
    the last month Ushra'Khan has targeted Sylph's supply lines and most notably the
    Kari pipe. \"They are currently suffering major internal strife and are losing
    [corporations]... since we began this focused campaign,\" he explained.  \n  \nYvain
    Dragonheart of Sylph acknowledged that Ushra'Khan was trying to exploit the recent
    changes in his alliance. \"With the loss of our fearless ex-leader Drakmor and
    of many old [corporations] we are not very strong... We fall under the 'easy targets'
    sign,\" he said, promptly adding that he also believes Ushra'Khan poses no threat
    to Sylph: \"They are like bees; hard to catch and annoying, but not deadly.\"
    \ \n  \nValotaan, a capsuleer flying under Sylph's insignia, gave his view of
    Ushra'Khan's combact tactics: \"Usually we see them (or don't see them) in cloaked
    ships attacking people who are not prepared for a fight... [or] shooting our station
    services with stealth bombers.\"   \n  \nThe situation in the field might soon
    heat up. According to Sapphrine, Ushra'Khan's diplomat, the alliance will soon
    issue a refocus order that will \"aim to deny Sylph the use of their space.\"
    \ \n  \nUshra'Khan's claims were promptly dismissed by Sylph's representative,
    Vito Russo. \"For the people of [Ushra'Khan], you will never take Sylph, as we
    are brave pilots who will fight to the end and never give up. We shall stick by
    our allies and our allies will stick by us until [Ushra'Khan] is NO More!\"  \n
