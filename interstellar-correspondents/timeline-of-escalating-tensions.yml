    these events, and find out how pilots allied with these factions are reacting.\n\n**[14th

    \u2013 Otro Gariushi the CEO of the Ishukone Corporation announced tomorrow's
    Malkalen Economic Summit to be held with representatives of the Gallente Federation
    in hope that it would _\u201Cpromote healing between [the] nations\u201D_.\n\n**[15th
    May 11:29](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2047/igbd.php?article=2013)**
    \u2013 The Gallente Federation delegation fleet arrives in the Malkalen system,
    including a Nyx-class super carrier piloted by Admiral Alexander Noir. The Summit
    delegation departs the carrier in a shuttle, and boards the station. An embrace
    between Otro Gariushi and Wadis Chene (Federation Economic Minister) marks the
    start of the conference.\n\n**[15th May 12:49](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2047/igbd.php?article=2016)**
    \u2013 The Gallente Federation Nyx collides with the Ishukone Headquaters causing
    a massive explosion, and resulting in a fire fight between the remaining Gallente
    escort ships and Caldari forces. Logs from the local subspace channel in the Malkalen
    system later confirm that the collision was a deliberate action by the Nyx pilot,
    Admiral Alexander Noir.\n\nDame Digby, a Gallente pilot made this comment on GalNet:
    _\u201CI would say what a waste. A waste not only of resources, which are becoming
    ever more precious with capsuleer wars, but of human life. Both Gallente and Caldari
    were aboard the station I presume. Both our nations have been struck by this act,
    this should be an action which unifies us, not divides us.\u201D_\n\nWhen asked
    where he was at the time of the incident a Caldari pilot named Jude Kopenhagen
    said: _\u201CI was busy moving some goods for a Caldari agent of mine. I heard
    the report moments after it happened I believe. To be honest, I was not surprised
    that something happened; the Summit was a prime chance for any with a hidden vendetta
    to strike. But still... the nature of the incident was a shock.\u201D_\n\n**[15th

    \u2013 The Ishukone Corporation officially launches its disaster relief program,
    and comments on the severely disrupted chain of command. This program is in addition
    to the efforts made by other organizations and pod pilots starting, including
    the Sisters of EVE. \n\nStitcher, one of the pod pilots involved in the relief
    effort, said this about his involvement: _\u201CSimple - Ishukone's 'my' corporation.
    My family's worked for that megacorp for generations - I clone jumped up the instant
    I heard about the attack\u201D_.\n\n**[16th May 17:43](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2047/igbd.php?article=2026)**
    \u2013 The Ishukone Corporation releases a statement revealing the sequence of
    events leading up to the catastrophe, as well as announcing the death of their
    CEO Otro Gariushi. The current death toll is also released, standing at 421,000
    lost station residents and visitors. \n\n**[17th May 19:49](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2047/igbd.php?article=2023)**
    \u2013 The Amarr Theology Council officially announces an Empire-wide day of mourning
    following the events in Malkalen on the 15th.\n\n**[19th May 10:30](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2047/igbd.php?article=2030)**
    \u2013 The Gallente Federation President, Souro Foiritan, officially denies any
    Federation involvement with the _\u201Cmonstrous act\u201D_ , and offers assistance
    to those in need. \n\nJude Kopenhagen, a Caldari pilot, was not impressed with
    the response: _\u201C[Concerning] the rather late response... although I have
    no reason to not believe it, it was not everything I expected. I believe they
    did not even apologise, but just shifted blame.\u201D_\n\n**[20th May 19:53](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2047/igbd.php?article=2009)**
    \u2013 A number of mercantile vessels of Amarr origin are destroyed while within
    the borders of Minmatar space. The Parliamentary Minister for Internal Security,
    Shokur Geruth, distanced the Minmatar government from the attacks by confirming
    that there was no involvement by either the Republic Fleet or any of their law
    enforcement agencies.\n\nAn Admiral within the Praetoria Imperialis Excubitoris
    organisation, Rodj Blake, was disdainful about this recent event: _\u201CYes,
    [it was] a terrible crime and I hope that the Republic will take appropriate action
    against the perpetrators. If they don't, then I can see Amarrian military ships
    escorting future merchant convoys there.\u201D_\n\n**[21st May 13:39](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2047/igbd.php?article=2035)**
    \u2013Warring factions in The Bleak Lands continue to step up their activity as
    greater numbers of Minmatar militias enter the combat zone. The Minmatar Republic
    government continues to deny allegations of involvement with those fighting in
    that area. \n\n**[22nd May 15:02](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2047/igbd.php?article=2039)**
    \u2013 At a CONCORD Assembly meeting, representatives of the Amarr Empire read
    a statement accusing the Minmatar Republic of secretly supporting militias within
    The Bleak Lands. This statement was the result of what they claim is a growing
    body of evidence proving that the militias are actually based in controlled Minmatar
    Republic space. The statement was heckled by Federation and Republic delegations,
    and followed by a strong rebuttal from the Minmatar speaker.\n\nBiggus Tankus
    a mercenary, and staunch supporter of the Minmatar Republic, had this to say about
    the Amarrian accusation: _\u201CThey have always accused us of this [type of aggression].
    When its obviously not us involved, they try to shift the blame so they don't
    look inept.\u201D_\n\n**[22nd May 15:42](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2047/igbd.php?article=2034)**
    \u2013 Exercise \u2018Brotherhood\u2019 begins in Metropolis, marking the start
    of the largest joint military exercise ever undertaken between the Federation
    Navy and Republic Fleet. This is met with a hostile reaction from both the Caldari
    State, and Amarr Empire, who view the exercise as both disturbing in the wake
    of the recent Malkalen disaster, and an unnecessary effort to _\u201Crattle sabres\u201D_.
    \n\n_\u201CI'm having trouble understanding their motives.\u201D_ Said Stitcher,
    a pilot involved with the Malkalen relief effort. _\u201CI understand the need
    for military efficiency, but a joint operation near our border territories, so
    soon after such a cataclysm? Either they don't care, or they're paranoid.\u201D_\n\nBiggus
    Tankus has rather a different view: _\u201CWho cares what they think, it\u2019s
    a step in the right direction in my opinion, a show of force to show we're not
    as backwards as they like to think.\u201D_"
