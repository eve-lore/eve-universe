    Heimatar** \\- Minmatar and Amarr capsuleer miltia forces clashed in Auga on the
    29th of last month, with two Nyx supercarriers being deployed in the low security
    border system by the Matari.   \n  \nAmarrian forces rallied a capital fleet of
    four Archon-class carriers to take on the opposing Minmatar forces and dispatched
    it to Auga where they focused their attention on the Minmatar support fleet.   \n
    \ \nAccording to Saaya Illirie, member of the Amarrian fleet, \"Amarrian carriers
    went into [triage](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Triage), and the Amarrian
    commander called for the fleet to hold the field and engage all Minmatar.\" Once
    the support fleet had been substantially diminished, the Amarr capitals engaged
    with the Tribal Liberation Force's capital vessels - two Nyx supercarriers, an
    Archon and a Thanatos.   \n  \nThe Minmatar forces attempted to withdraw their
    capital ships, but the Thanatos was tackled and destroyed by Amarr forces while
    the TLF-affiliated Archon self-destructed. The two Nyx supercarriers were, however,
    able to escape.   \n  \nSaaya Illirie, member of the Amarrian forces, had few
    words on the matter, said \"We prayed for God to be with us, and he answered our
    prayers. Amarr Victor!\" No comment has been received from representatives of
    the Minmatar militia fleet as yet.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[24th Imperial
