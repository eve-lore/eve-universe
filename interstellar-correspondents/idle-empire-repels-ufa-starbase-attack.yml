    small number of systems in the region have been under IDLE sovereignty for 2 weeks;
    it was only early this week that their presence has drawn UFA's attention. Rowlandos,
    head of IDLE, denies UFA or KIA had any right over the systems: _\"it was unclaimed,
    to claim space you [have to] put [a] sovereignty claim on it.\"_\n\nThe successful
    defence of their starbase was the result of a joint operation with their allies,
    Gay4Life and Eternal Rapture. Rowlandos went on to comment that they were given
    no warning before the attack, and that they were not the aggressors: _\"they started
    it, they shot first.\"_\n\nGendril, XO of the United Freemen Alliance, now believes
    that the situation will continue to worsen as allies of IDLE become involved:
    _\"It seems some of their friends have declared war on us, so it seems what could
    have been a minor issue will escalate.\"_\n\n \n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by
