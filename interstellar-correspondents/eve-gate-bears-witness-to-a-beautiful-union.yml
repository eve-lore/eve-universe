- body: "12 days ago, under the wan light of the EVE gate, a couple were bound by
    the strongest and most permanent force known to mankind: love. Quirc and Layrah,
    members of EVE Defense Force and Ascendant Frontier alliance, were bonded in wedlock
    by Rash'kyu Wha, a master of ceremonies from Polaris. Solemnly intoning his benediction
    and blessing under the stars, Rash\u2019kyu formally pronounced Quirc and Layrah
    husband and wife.   \n  \nThe following is a partial transcript of the ceremony.
    \  \n  \nRash'kyu Wha > Ladies and Gentlemen, please be at rest. We gather here
    today to celebrate the union of Layrah and Quirc, two people who have reached
    between the stars to find each other amid the blackness of space. Although the
    empires rest uneasy,   \nRash'kyu Wha > and war stretches throughout the fringes
    of space, Layrah and Quirc managed to find each other amid the chaos.   \nRash'kyu
    Wha > Layrah, descended from the Brutors, has known her share of pain and suffering.
    Many of her people still lie under the yoke of slavery.   \nRash'kyu Wha > Yet,
    despite this heritage, she has reached out and touched Quirc, a Civire, who has
    transcended petty profits to find a commodity that, truly, has no price.   \nRash'kyu
    Wha > It was a little over a year ago that these two found each other, drifting
    in the void. Layrah came from an athletic family, focusing her mind and body,
    while Quirc honed his skills in electronics and computers.   \nRash'kyu Wha >
    On their separate home worlds, both looked into the sky with wonder, wishing to
    ply the space lanes with the elite pod pilots.   \nRash'kyu Wha > Soon enough,
    both got their wish, and were immersed in the nutrient fluid and synaptic connections
    that distinguish pod pilots from the rest of humanity.   \nRash'kyu Wha > Gradually,
    they overcame their differences and fell in love.   \nRash'kyu Wha > Today we
    honor that love beneath the shattered remnants of the EVE gate, our shared tragedy.
    \  \nRash'kyu Wha > It is fitting to have the ceremony here, because it is only
    here that all races and people of EVE have a common tie.   \nRash'kyu Wha > Where
    we were bound in this sector of space, so shall we bind these two in wedlock.
    \  \nRash'kyu Wha > May your days be fruitful, and your life long. May you prosper
    well and be fortunate in every venture. May you help others and help each other,
    even unto death.   \nRash'kyu Wha > Help, hold, and comfort each other in the
    blackness between stars.   \nRash'kyu Wha > Then by the rights and privileges
    of all humanity, whether be thy lost or found, planet-born or space-worn, I pronounce
    you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.   \n  \nThe wedding was attended
    by close friends and an honor guard of ASCN pilots, who cheered enthusiastically
    at the end of the ceremony. Quirc and Layrah flew off to spend some time together
    and are said to be happy and enjoying their time together. A spokesman from Polaris
    had this to say about the incident:   \n  \n\"Regardless of your past, present,
    or future, regardless of your views on life and liberty, and regardless of your
    occupation or chosen path, Polaris honors the bond between two people that is
    built from love and mutual respect. We wish the two pilots the best and hope they
    live long and fruitful lives.\""
