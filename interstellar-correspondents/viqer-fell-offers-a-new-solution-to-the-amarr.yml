    name in the Minmatar community: Viqer Fell. For friends he is the perfect picture
    of a loyal tribesman for his enemies he is a cold hearted psychopath or a troubled
    and disillusioned slave. \n\nViqer fell started his pilot career as a miner, he
    met the other founders of his corporation and they quickly became friends, they
    shared the same ideas on the fate of their people. The corporation would grow
    famous under the name _The People\u2019s Front of Minmatar_ , it represented the
    ethos they wished to create, a brotherhood of pilots that would defend and stand
    for their **own** people. \n\nViqer Fell: \u201CWe all had come from broken families,
    smashed and tattered backgrounds with a common link; that of slavery. We decided
    when we left Metis Industries that we would endeavour to change society. That
    we would try to ensure that future generations would not suffer the injustice
    and degradation that the Amarrian disease had imposed upon us and inflicted upon
    our families.\u201D \n\nFor years Viqer and his associates have fought and rebelled
    against the Amarr in many imaginative ways, yet some may say primitive. They broke
    Concord law when they hunted slavers in empire claimed space and they thwarted
    Concord when they would come after _The Peoples Front of Minmatar_. Viqer Fell:
    \u201CWe were the first corporation to lay minefields at the gates of Amarr prime,
    to close down travel for the general populace and in some cases to escape the
    Concord fleet that pursued us 8 jump gates in an attempt of retribution\u201D.
    \  \nViqer is brutally honest in admitting his acts of crime, or justice. It seems
    as with so many stories it happens to depend on who you are asking whether something
    is seen as a crime or swift justice. In this case Viqer has a rather unique viewpoint
    on his murderous acts. Viqer Fell: \u201CI have killed many many pilots now and
    I have every one of their names noted. It is a long list and I curse their names
    each evening. Had they chosen their lives better I would not have been forced
    to kill them and they owe me for that.\u201D \n\nAccording to Viqer every Amarr
    is guilty for the sins and crimes their people has committed against the Minmatar,
    so whether an individual opposes slavery is irrelevant. The next logical step
    is to ask who else has made a profit from slavery or never actively acted against
    it. The answer to this question has not eluded Viqer and his corporation for long.
    Recently there has been an announcement made on the future cooperation between
    _The Peoples Front of Minmatar_ and _Jericho Fraction_ , now both of these corporations
    will fight the old empires and other tyrants of their Free Space Ideal. I couldn\u2019t
    help but ask more surrounding this next step.  \nViqer Fell: \u201CFor too long
    have we focussed on the symptoms and not the root cause of the problem. We have
    believed that in genocide lay the only hope for the victims of the Amarr and yet
    as you yourself have mentioned, the other races stand by and allow this vile trade
    in human misery. We ourselves have come to see that oppression is not only limited
    to the more extreme facets of human evil such as slavery. Oppression is also present
    in much more civil and social disguises however, oppression it remains. In joining
    Jericho we seek to tackle this mindset that capsuleers have wrapped around themselves\u201D.
    \n\nArielle deVoir: \u201CDo you think that these social constraints and the heritage
    of Empire constricted life is the reason why sometimes Minmatar who were freed
    then willingly return to their Masters and continue to serve in slavery?\u201D
    \  \nViqer Fell: \u201CSome are so indoctrinated that they see no alternative
    and prefer the safety and somewhat debatable refuge of a Holders estate. Some
    are treacherous scum who willingly embrace enslavement. It is a sad fact that
    many people are so unhappy, their souls so small within them, that they feel it
    necessary to punish themselves. These tend to be the willing slaves and it is
    those that I pity the most. Others are just misguided fools\u201D. \n\nAfter the
    topic of slavery there was need of a more light hearted subject to converse about,
    after all he insulted me several times already because of my own race and this
    discourse did make you wonder about owing a debt to an entire race, it\u2019s
    sure to make one feel slightly uneasy. Viqer told me about his family and partners,
    who like so many other partners finds it hard to accept that their other half
    is a pilot. Yet they make time for each other and it\u2019s a reassuring idea
    that even the most cold hearted murderers can find love and happiness with someone.
    Apart from love Viqer also has a fondness for scuba diving on the planet, he reads
    avidly and likes to spend time with his family. Viqer Fell: \u201CI am ever a
    soft hearted man, its just many people can't see through my cold hearted psychopathic
    outer shell to see it. I cannot count the amount of times I've killed someone
    then apologised privately and given them isk.\u201D \n\nSo it seems that Viqer
    truly is a man of contradictions, he is a warm family man, respected amongst Minmatar
    and feared by the Amarr and considered a murderer. Some people accuse him of piracy
    and being a lawbreaker others cheer him for being a rebel with a good cause. We
    quickly came unto the topic of respect for enemies in battle. Even between blood
    sworn enemies it is possible that they find a way to respect each others capability,
    and Viqer isn\u2019t an exception to this practise. I asked him how someone can
    respect the person they are sworn to kill and hate with a passion. Viqer is convinced
    that his enemies respect him for his combat style and that of his entire corporation;
    they always abided to strict rules and behaved well in public. When an enemy shows
    respect they can count on being respected in return. An eagerness to fight is
    another way to earn respect from enemies, especially when you fight with honour.
    Viqer sums it up in the eloquent line: \u201CCourteous in defeat and kind in victory\u201D.
    \n\nSo, what can we expect now from Viqer and his corporation? The corporation
    will exist in name but most of the members will join the ranks of Jericho. Together
    they will fight for their new and shared ideals, that of a free space and liberation
    from the visible and invisible bounds that the old empires have us tied in. This
    means that there is also a new way to free the minmatar that doesn\u2019t involve
    the slaughter of the Amarr race. However Viqer maintains that it will be necessarily
    in the end because it is unlikely that the Amarr will change. Viqer Fell: \u201CI
    think the Amarrians would be the first to admit they'll never change and therefore
    we have two options; force change or accept their evil existence. If I did the
    latter then I may as well put the fetters on my own wrists myself and hobble off
    to Gaius's holdings. If they refuse to accept change through sensible means then
    extermination is their own choice\u201D. Sometimes nothing seems to change truly
    at it\u2019s core, or as Viqer said my death is rather postponed then cancelled.
    With that I saw it fit to say my farewells and leave, rather quick too I might
    add."
