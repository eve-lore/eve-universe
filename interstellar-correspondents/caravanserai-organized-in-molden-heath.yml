    Molden Heath** \\- A follow-up to the \"caravanserai\" gathering that was organized
    by Smagd of Encina Technologies in Namtz' aar K'in alliance may be scheduled soon.
    The last gathering - a blend of trade show and celebration - took place in Teonsude,
    Molden Heath on 14.04.111 and was hailed as a moderate success with great potential
    for expansion.  \n  \nThough a pilot, Smagd works and lives as a member of the
    nomadic Minmatar Thukker tribe alongside his own corporate affiliations. The word
    'caravanserai' originates in pre-space faring parlance, referring to an inn or
    way station with a wide courtyard where trade caravans could meet and camp together.
    Smagd, however, uses the word in a broader context to mean the gathering itself,
    not its location.  \n  \nSmagd explains that the purpose of the caravanserai is
    the \"bringing goods and news, and forging alliances in order so separate groups,
    or tribes, didn't have to travel the greatest distances all on their own.\" He
    continues by saying, \"We swap stories, you know? We talk. We argue half the night,
    we have drinking matches, and shouting ones. There's some feuds that get settled,
    and some that spring into life.\"  \n  \nHis first caravanserai saw a wide variety
    of items being traded, including corporate shares, various rare factional items
    and curiosities such as Thukker loot and ancient sculptures from the Nefantar
    era. Smagd claimed that such diversity was typical for a caravanserai event.  \n
    \ \nAccording to Smagd, all kinds of people show up on the caravansaries he organizes.
    Not all of them are fully aware of the Minmatar cultural history. \"It's very
    easy to spot them though. They know nothing of tribe lore.\" He added that everyone
    who shows up with good intentions is welcome to visit, though most guest prefers
    to conduct their business privately.  \n  \n\"Normally it's good enough to spread
    a date and a place in our channels, or just do an instant caravanserai. There's
    a few tribes that are hard to reach, even by Thukker standards. So I put out the
    word on GalNet, which is probably a first\". There is no date settled for a new
    gathering yet, but Smagd assured the Interstellar Correspondents that a date and
    time will be announced soon.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this
