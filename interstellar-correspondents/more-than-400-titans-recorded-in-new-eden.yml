    **Yulai, Genesis** \\- More than 400 titans are currently operating in New Eden,
    according to a list maintained by Cyrus Doul of Systematic Chaos. While this number
    alone seems large, it is likely that the actual number of operational titans is
    significantly greater due to the care taken in deploying the vessels and the number
    used solely for logistical tasks.   \n  \n[![An Erebus Titan at Alliance Tournament
    VIII](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4265/erebus1thumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4265/erebus1.png)A
    single titan takes approximately one month to build and costs approximately 35
    billion ISK in raw materials for the hull alone. When the ships first became available,
    constructing one was often a project undertaken by a whole alliance, and wars
    were fought in order to put down the ships before they could even be launched.
    \  \n  \nThe first titan, CYVOK's Avatar, belonging to CYVOK of Ascendant Frontier,
    was unveiled more than four years ago, almost a year after titan blueprints were
    released. Many more followed and their number has grown rapidly over the years.
    \  \n  \nDoul's list now shows 402 publically-known titans with many alliances
    owning far more than one; IT alliance is said to have about 68 titans at their
    disposal and Morsus Mihi has an alleged total of 32.   \n  \nDoul's list, however,
    might not cover all titans currently in existence. Titan commander BadGirl84 of
    IT alliance estimated another \"100 or more unknown titans.\" She explained that
    her vessel is most frequently used for logistical operations, such as opening
    jump portals for allied combat or transport fleets, or in a fleet support capacity,
    running warfare links from a discrete location in system rather than directly
    engaging.   \n  \nShe found it natural for more titans to appear as pilots grow
    more experienced and anticipates that titans will lose much of their appeal as
    they would appear much more often become even more common in the future.   \n
    \ \nAn Ev0ke fleet commander, who preferred to remain anonymous, explained that
    their titans are also most often deployed for logistical operations, but also
    see occasional use in the destruction of lone, unprepared capital ships through
    their doomsday devices.   \n  \nBoth interviewees agreed on one point, which was
    the threat large supercapital fleets pose to young and relatively small alliances.
    BadGirl84 said \"If they want to get into 0.0, they have to ally with someone
    who is there or rent space.\"\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[List of known titans](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1330696)
