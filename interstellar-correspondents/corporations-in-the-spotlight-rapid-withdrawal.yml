    \n\nRapid Withdrawal participates in a number of activities ranging from DED sites,
    level 5 missions and gate camping, all the way up to 20+man cruiser fleets. It's
    common to find members running in groups of 4 or more pilots in small gang warfare,
    fighting in complexes.\n\nTo hold their space with pride is their driving focus
    and they certainly won't give it up without a fight, with a philosophy of \"Come
    on over and get some\" to those that would oppose them.\n\nWith a need for more
    capsuleers on the Gallente faction warfare frontlines, Rapid Withdrawal is always
    recruiting and will take any capsuleer eager to fight in factional warfare in
    aid of the Gallente.\n\nWith a small batch of excellent Fleet Commanders, and
    an active philosophy to push able pilots into \"leadership\" type roles in industry
    or Fleet Command, growth in a capsuleers career and knowledge base when joining
    Rapid Withdrawal is almost assured.\n\nTo have your corporation highlighted in
    this segment contact ISD Jarrett Pelley with your celebrations and events."
