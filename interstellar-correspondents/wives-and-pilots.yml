    white gas clouds and set amid a backdrop of scattered stars, the Ceremonial Grounds
    in the New Caldari system will live in the minds of only the few, fortunate Pod
    Pilots who marry there. \n\nEven in today\u2019s busy world, some pod pilots manage
    to find the time for romance. These minority are able to put aside work and make
    room for partners, wives and husbands. Evanda Char, a Minmatar senior member of
    Electus Matari, made the time for marriage. In an interview, Evanda explained
    about how her relationship with the Caldari national Meklon began and developed,
    eventually turning into a marriage. Like everything in life, their relationship
    has its successes and difficulties. \n\n\u201CWhen we first met, he'd just taken
    over from Thetis Midvar as the head of our alliance. We were both working closely
    to build the alliance and take it new places. We were working so closely together
    and, well, he was quite a funny guy. With implants like that, I guess you have
    to be. We had a lot of fun together and got closer and closer, the way people
    do. There was a bit of rivalry involved; I'd been almost seeing someone else shortly
    before things started up with Mek. He insisted on fighting it out during the deployment
    of my first Control Tower, having a hard time grasping the fact that it was up
    to me.\u201D \n\nFrom there, Evanda grew even closer to Meklon and eventually
    he presented a pair of Dynasty rings to her in proposal. These rings are quite
    rare, available exclusively from high-quality traders in Amarr. \n\n\u201CWe had
    Father Goose conduct the ceremony. He's a rather heretical priest, by Amarr standards,
    so he was the perfect choice. We were able to bait our enemies and get hitched
    all at the same time.\u201D \n\nThe ceremony was held appropriately in Minmatar
    space at what the DED refer to as the \u2018Contested Minmatar Legendary Stronghold\u2019.
    To Evanda and Meklon, it held a deeper significance. \n\n\u201CWe held our wedding
    out in space near General Hraldar's fortress in Hjoramold. We call it 'his place'
    because of our genealogy, which claims Hraldar was an ancestor of mine.\u201D
    \n\nAccording to Evanda, there were protests to her wedding. \n\n\u201CRodj Blake,
    an Amarrian loyalist, showed up in a covert operations vessel and claimed that
    my owner hadn't given permission and the priest was inappropriate. But Father
    Goose soldiered on with the service - and rather beautiful it was too.\u201D \n\nEvanda
    had this to say to any couples entertaining the idea of marriage: \u201CI guess
    what I learned most is that even if things goes horribly wrong, it's always worth
    trying. Even pain is better than emptiness; there\u2019s always something to cherish.\u201D
    \n\nWhat significance does marriage have for a pilot in today\u2019s world? It
    can mean the difference between coming home to an empty apartment or seeing a
    cherished partner waiting for you. Marriage may simply be a contract for bearing
    children or it could represent a sign of trust between two loving individuals.
    \n\nWhatever marriage and partnerships mean to you, they are as much a part of
    this universe as shields and blasters are. They should be cherished as well as
    supported."
