- body: "**Syndicate** : Pirate-infested but full of potential. In the eyes of many
    corporations on the border of empire space, the whole region is little more than
    a route to richer pastures in the Cloud Ring region and beyond. Endless small
    skirmishes escalate into huge wars, often involving some of the most feared combat
    pilots of our galaxy. \n\nThese two regions are largely recognized as unclaimed,
    perhaps due to the fact that no organization is believed to be able to hold on
    to them. Yet there are alliances of like-minded individuals here, quietly gathering
    in the outer fringes of inhabited space. \n\nNow, upper Syndicate has become a
    warzone once more, with reported battles of dozens of battlehips slugging it out
    in 2P-4LS and nearby systems, the combatants are being the **Outer Ring Society**
    and **Arcadia Alliance**. \n\nIt is unclear exactly how the war started. Neither
    of the alliances are known to be particularly militant, and both claim to fight
    against all pirate activity. However, the root of the conflict seems to stem from
    Arcadia being accused by the ORS of harboring pirate supporters. \n\n**Umlat**
    , the official ORS spokesman stated the following during a press conference hosted
    by the Arcadia Alliance:   \n_\"All honest corporations willing to split from
    [Arcadia] will be allowed to operate in the area, just as any other non pirate
    corporation [has been allowed].\"_  \nAbout Arcadia themselves, he had the following
    to say: _\"...they are corrupt and using smoke and mirrors to try and hide it.
    We are going to remove them from this side of the map. Either us, or Fountain
    Alliance and us or FA, Evolution and us.\"_\n\nRepresentatives from the Arcadia
    alliance, whose alliance had been fighting against the well-known Evolution corporation
    last week, denied all involvements with pirates.  \n_\"Arcadia never allowed any
    pirate to go anywhere, we allowed them to taste our broadsides.\"_ said **Soulchaser**
    , a member of Arcadia.   \n_\"The accusations against Arcadia are MORE than vague.
    No proof has been offered, except for hearsay and Umlat's word.\"_ said **Stue**
    , the Arcadian who moderated the conference. \n\nORS has demanded that Arcadia
    either disband or join them. Or in Umlat's words: _\"If not, then we are going
    to assume the rumors are true.\"_\n\nUnsurprisingly, Arcadia declined. Although
    some members expressed the pointlessness of the war, they did not seem to take
    to the ultimatum. An anonymous Arcadian pilot commented that Arcadia and ORS had
    been living in peace for a long time, and wasn't sure if all the corporations
    of the ORS (who outnumber Arcadia in manpower allegedly ten to one) were actually
    willing to go to war against them. This remains to be seen. \n\nThe cease-fire
    that had been hurredly signed for these negotiations is officially over. CONCORD
    warns all corporations to travel through the warzone, and wishes to remind pilots
    that this is well out of empire space - and the protection of police vessels."
