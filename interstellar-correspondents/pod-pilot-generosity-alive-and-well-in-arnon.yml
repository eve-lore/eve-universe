    \\- When a friend of Maruu Navorra, of Superior Mining and Logistics [HMMR], decided
    to retire from capsuleering, he gave Maruu an unexpected gift; three thousand
    assorted ships. As he had no immediate use for so many hulls, he could have sold
    them for a tidy profit. Instead, he decided to give back to the community of New
    Eden by donating almost all of them. As he tells us, \"well, I was feeling kind
    of generous, so I felt people could use the ships more than I could.\"  \n  \nAfter
    filling his Orca class vessel with ships, he undocks from the Sister's of EVE
    station in Arnon and launches the ships. \"People have to come out in their pod
    or a shuttle to get them\", Marruu stated. \"Ships being given out are: Frigates,
    Destroyers, Cruisers, Battle Cruisers, Mining barges, and at the end I launch
    a single shuttle, the one who boards it first, gets a battleship of their choice.\"
    \ \n  \nMarruu states that there are no preconditions to receiving a ship, other
    than \"to have the skill needed for the ship and be at the event.\" To date six
    hundred ships have been given out to New Eden's capsuleers, according to Maruu,
    with an estimated two thousand remaining to be distributed. Additionally, he estimates
    the isk value of the ships donated so far to be around two and a half billion
    with a total nearing ten billion including the ships he still has left to give
    away.  \n  \nContralto of GCHQ [GCH] states that he \"witnessed Maruu in action,
    in Arnon, loads of ships from shuttles up to cruisers flying in all directions
    from the Orca\" adding that \"there was confusion in local channel, as skeptics
    tried in vain to work out what the scam was; no scam just loads of free ships.\"
    \ \n  \nMarru says that after these events he is \"hoping people will look at
    this and learn that people don't have to scam to have fun in New Eden.\"  \n  \nThe
    next scheduled event will be will be held at Arnon, Sister's of EVE Station on
    Saturday the 20th of June.\n\n**GalNet Reference:**\n\n[Official Release](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1087142)\n\n
