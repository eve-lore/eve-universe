    two thousand capsuleers present in the Amarr system on September 28, YC 118.8
    during the [historic coronation of Empress Catiz I](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/catiz-i-addresses-capsuleers-and-imperial-guard-after-historic-day-in-dam-torsad/),
    CONCORD communication relays were filled with comms traffic. We, at Interstellar
    Correspondents, approached several capsuleers with for their opinions on the coronation
    ceremony.\n\n[![](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/70564/1/Coronation_Catiz_1_550.jpg)](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/70564/1/Coronation_Catiz_1.png)\n\nCapsuleer
    [Thomas Moroh](https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Thomas%20Moroh) of [BattleHamsters](https://gate.eveonline.com/Corporation/BattleHamsters)
    [BHSRR] had this to say\n\n> I'm not exactly sure what to expect. Despite the
    need for action I hope this will actually go... 'peacefully', give or take an
    odd Bowhead looking for a fight, and the Empire will get stability with a new
    ruler.\n\nAlthough the ships used were different, Thomas Moroh eerily predicted
    the actions of two Providence class freighters owned by Rote Works during the
    coronation address.\n\n[Titus Tallang](https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Titus%20Tallang),
    a Director of Education at [EVE University](https://gate.eveonline.com/Corporation/EVE%20University)
    [E-UNI] offered more formal congratulations to the new Empress.\n\n> The University
    would like offer our congratulations to her highness, Empress Catiz I, on her
    ascension to the Imperial throne. Though we are a capsuleer organization and do
    not consider ourselves to be affiliated with any of the major powers of New Eden,
    we still hold Her Majesty in the utmost esteem and eagerly await her leading the
    Amarr with the same wisdom and intelligence that she has plentifully demonstrated
    in her past actions.\n\n[![](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/70564/1/Coronation_Catiz_2_550.jpg)](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/70564/1/Coronation_Catiz_2.png)\n\n[Chribba](https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Chribba)
    of [Otherworld Enterprises](https://gate.eveonline.com/Corporation/Otherworld%20Enterprises)
    [OTHER] was seen at the Coronation site in his infamous 'Veldnaught', the presence
    of which was recognized by the new Empress during her address. Chribba commented
    that it \"should be a fun event to attend\" and remarked \"I'm all for the new
    ruler\" in regards to the new Empress.\n\nImperial Sergeant [Chris Vattic](https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Chris%20Vattic)
    of [Imperial Dreams](https://gate.eveonline.com/Corporation/Imperial%20Dreams)
    [IG] was similarly positive,\n\n> I believe Her Majesty will inspire much faith
    and confidence in her rule. What God has decreed must be.\n\nHis sentiments were
    echoed by numerous other members of the Curatores Veritatis Alliance in the Amarr
    system's local communication channel during the coronation. As part of her address,
    Empress Catiz I celebrated the long running Amarr loyalist alliance, along with
    Praetoria Imperialis Excubitoris [PIE], whose recruiter, Aldrith Shutaq was seen
    looking for new loyalists during the event.\n\n[![](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/70564/1/Coronation_Catiz_3_550.jpg)](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/70564/1/Coronation_Catiz_3.png)\n\nInterstellar
    Correspondents were also able to approach [Lysus](https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Lysus)
    of [Hard Knocks Inc.](https://gate.eveonline.com/Corporation/Hard%20Knocks%20Inc._)
    [HRDKX], a Champion to Aritcio Kor-Azor prior to the coronation address who called
    the bloodline of the new Empress into question,\n\n> An unpure bloodline should
    have never been allowed to compete in the tournament! How can we truly be the
    beacon of light if we are ruled by the unpure?! MAKE AMARR PURE AGAIN\n\nLysus'
    Paladin class Marauder was [destroyed](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56318512/)
    during the coronation address by Amarr loyalists following a sanction from the
    Order of St. Tetrimon.\n\nAlso present in system were numerous Minmatar pilots,
    who called on the Empress to address Amarr slavery policies. [Kujo Minowara](https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Kujo%20Minowara)
    of Imperial Guardians [I G] demanded \"to know what will your stance towards the
    Minmatar Tribal Republic be, and what are your words to the Matari people, the
    free and the enslaved, and the freedom fighters.\" Although drowned out by the
    volume of Amarr Victor chants across communication channels, several dissenting
    voices were heard chanting support for the Minmatar people.\n\n[![](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/70564/1/Coronation_Catiz_4_550.jpg)](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/70564/1/Coronation_Catiz_4.png)\n\nInterstellar
    Correspondents can also confirm that a bomb threat was received by ISD-IC offices
    from [Sven Holstien](https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Sven%20Holstien), a member
    of [Stimulus](https://gate.eveonline.com/Corporation/Stimulus) [STIM] under the
    Rote Kapelle alliance. The capsuleer did not have any comments regarding the coronation
    of Empress Catiz I. \n\n* * *\n\nGot something newsworthy?  \nCome join us in
