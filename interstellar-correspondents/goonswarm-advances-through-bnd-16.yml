- body: "BND-16 \u2013 Earlier this week, Goonswarm launched an attack on the BND-16
    system. After knocking out the cynosural jammer in the system, they proceeded
    to destroy enemy towers around the various moons. Smash Alliance and ROADKILL
    attempted to stop the assault, but the system was firmly in Goonswarm's hands
    as of this writing.\n\nThe fighting in BND-16 started as small skirmishes and
    escalated to large-scale engagements over the course of several days. Gaining
    a foothold in the system allowed them to jump in their support and several capital
    ships, including three Titans.\n\nIn a failed attempt to take out a newly deployed
    Goonswarm tower, ROADKILL lost three capital ships; a Moros and two Phoenixes.
    Losses on the Goonswarm side are unknown at this time.\n\nROADKILL and Smash Alliance
    retaliated by attacking at LXQ2-T and deploying a Titan in UBX-CC. Sources in
    ROADKILL say the attack at LXQ2-T was to draw Goonswarm into a large-scale battle.
    LXQ2-T is the site of a jump bridge for Goonswarm and was targeted for this reason.
    The Titan deployed in UBX-CC, which holds the ROADKILL jump bridge, was mainly
    in system for defense.\n\nAvenguard of ROADKILL had this to say, _\u2018BND-16
    isn't of strategic importance to be honest. For them its a sovereign 4 system
    they have taken, along with BWF-ZZ and 8MG-J6, but it's also the easiest one we
    have to conquer. BWF-ZZ had too many moons to defend and after that fell, 8MG-J6
    was not defendable. It has only one gate to BWF-ZZ and too many moons. After that,
    BND-16 was isolated and again has many moons. For Goonswarm it\u2019s a great
    victory but in all honesty it gives them a foothold that\u2019s about it.\u2019_\n\n_\u2018The
    wars just begun we have enemies on all sides and our allies are on thin ground
    - what more can you ask for? If we win we're heroes, if we lose it\u2019s expected,\u2019_
    Avenguard said.\n\nGoonswarm representative agreed that BND-16 had no strategic
    value for them other than being the last sovereign 4 system in the Geminate Region.\n\n_\u2018We
    intend to make Geminate a [place where all new pod pilots] can roam free.\u2019_
    The Goonswarm representative was quoted as saying.\n\nGoonswarm was unavailible
    for additional comments at the time of this writing."
