    \  \n  \n\"I [still] have a very long way to go. I only have enough personal funds
    to fuel it for a month or two at the most,\" she said.  \n  \nTo prevent making
    the burial caskets an easy target, they will be protected by stronger encryption
    and the cemetery will sport a defensive screen: \"I think it's probably a certainty
    that it will get attacked... once the standings are up, I'll deploy the defences,\"
    said Azia.  \n  \nThe burial space will resume activities after a year-long halt,
    having been destroyed on 28 September 110 by the 'JihadSwarm' faction of GoonSwarm,
    who contested the morality of burial in space caskets.  \n  \nCorpses can be donated
    either to Azia Burgi or to the corporation 'EVE Cemetery'. Each casket will contain
    one or more corpses of the same pod pilot, as well as a customized epitaph.\n\n###
