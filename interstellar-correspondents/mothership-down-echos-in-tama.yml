    eight mothership class vessels representing the four main races of New Eden entered
    the Tama system with the intention of destroying as many Caldari Milita forces
    as possible.    \n  \nEarly reports are telling us that of the eight motherships
    only two made it out, as the Channel 4 News Team forces were engaged not by Caldari
    militia pilots but by pilots from the Cry Havoc. alliance.  \n  \nFull loses are
    still to be confirmed and a full report will be published once they have been
    established. \n\n# Galnet Links:\n\n<http://www.pawsofevil.com/kb/?a=home>  \n
