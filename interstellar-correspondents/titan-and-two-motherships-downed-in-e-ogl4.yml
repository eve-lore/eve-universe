- body: 'Northern Coalition and Greater BoB Community forces met in battle on the
    26th and 27th of this month in the E-OGL4 star system. Over 1,000 pilots were
    present during the exchanges and hundreds of ships were lost, including two GBC
    motherships and a GBC titan.


    Despite some [earlier setbacks](http://myeve.eve-online.com/mb/news.asp?nid=2259),
    it appears that The GBC ["Max Damage"](http://myeve.eve-online.com/mb/news.asp?nid=2256)
    offensive has been steadily advancing into the Tribute region via the Taisy/M-OEE8/E-OGL4
    corridor. The NC has been successfully holding a defensive position in the next
    system of that corridor, 15W-GC.


    On the night of the 26th, Shrike''s Avatar class titan was discovered and destroyed
    in E-OGL4 by a large Northern Coalition force. The ensuing rally by GBC forces
    and further reinforcement of NC forces combined into a large scale battle that
    claimed over 100 dreadnoughts, 20+ carriers, two motherships, and hundreds of
    battleships and support ships.


    The GBC withdrew from the battlefield during both of the large scale fights on
    the 26th and 27th. Although the GBC surrendered the battlefields to NC salvagers,
    they still maintain a tight grip on the system.'
