- body: "Despite even odds, a State Protectorate fleet of almost 80 pilots was crushed
    this evening by a Federal Defence fleet in Tama. \n\nElijah Ghost's fleet arrived
    in Tama with only minutes to spare before the State Protectorate fleet warped
    in on them. Targets were called with confidence and dispatched with ease. \n\nFinal
    assessments indicate the State Protectorate lost 75% - 80% of their fleet in this
    engagement. With losses barely above 25%, the Federal Defence fleet easily won
    the day. \n\nIn a disturbing show of cowardice, several State Protectorate pilots
    were seen outside of the station shooting at the capsules of Federal Defence pilots
    trying to return to their bases."
