    The Forge** \\- HYDRA  RELOADED has reportedly been selling several valuable Utu-class
    assault frigates.  \n  \nThe Utu blueprints were awarded to HYDRA as second place
    prizes in Alliance Tournament VIII. Only fifty Utu hulls can ever be built and
    their value is estimated at about 30 billion ISK per unit.  \n  \n[![](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4037/ututhumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4037/utu.png)The
    Utu is a specialized drone platform based on the Ishkur design. The vessel is
    also able to field considerable scrambling capabilities and is considered a strong
    combat platform.  \n  \nRecords indicate that at least one [Utu vessel has already
    been destroyed](http://genos.killmail.org/?a=kill_detail&kll_id=7168704). The
    vessel belonging to Morel Nova met its fate at the hand of CTPAHHUK UKC on 112.07.19.
    \ \n  \nSeveral of the forty-nine surviving ships have now been put on sale. Phunkadin
    explained that HYDRA RELOADED decided to sell part of its Utu vessel stock in
    a bid to raise enough capital to build a supercapital fleet.  \n  \nAccording
    to Phunkadin, not all of the Utus are going to be sold: \"we are going to use
    some of them... [to show] we are the best and should not be messed with.\"  \n
    \ \nIt is believed that the alliance has already sold about ten vessels and the
    same number [have been contracted to Chribba as collateral for an IPO](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1341805&page=3#84)
    on the alliance's behalf. Chribba also bought one Utu for private use.  \n  \nAdditionally,
    one Utu frigate [was awarded last month during the privately owned lottery \"ShipsofEve:AT8\"](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1341709&page=1#4).\n\n*
