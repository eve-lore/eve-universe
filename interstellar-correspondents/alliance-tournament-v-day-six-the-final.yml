    of the **Fifth Alliance Tournament**. Here is the result and review of the final
    match of the day. \n\n* * *\n\n**The Final**\n\n* * *\n\n**Match 95: Ev0ke Vs
    Triumvirate.**\n\nIt was an absolutely epic clash in the final, with both teams
    coming out hard and going blow for blow, right down to the last ship.\n\n**Ev0ke:**
    Harbinger | Curse | 6 Ruptures | Vigil  \n**Triumvirate.:** 3 Megathrons | Caldari
    Navy Hookbill | 2 Maulus | 4 Griffins\n\nEarly on in the fight Ev0ke sent a swarm
    of ECM over towards Triumvirate., looking as if they would trouble them from the
    beginning as they started to drop TRI support rapidly. As with their match previously
    however, TRI hung on with what support remained and stabilized themselves, keeping
    four frigates alive for as long as possible. The Harbinger and one Rupture of
    Ev0ke\u2019s were the next to drop as TRI wrestled the advantage back in their
    favor.\n\nTime took its toll on both teams with Ev0ke at one point down to 5 Ruptures,
    a Curse and Vigil as they removed the last of the TRI support. It was a battle
    of capacitor warfare and cruiser damage against the might of three Megathrons,
    and it was never clear which way it would go as both teams exchanged ship losses
    for ship kills in a dogged slugfest. By the time Ev0ke had taken another Megathron
    down, they had lost 3 Ruptures of their own.\n\nIt was a hair-rising last minute
    performance from the Ev0ke Curse and Rupture pilots, flanked by their Vigil. Together
    they worked down the 2nd Megathron, removing it from the field as only one final
    Rupture remained. The Curse had by now strangled the remaining TRI Megathron,
    and it struggled to fight any further as the singular remaining Rupture continued
    to slug away, all with slight hull damage, no armor and no shield.\n\nIt was a
    heroic fight down to the last of the ships, with individual pilots dictating the
    fate of their whole teams as more and more of their comrades fell beside them.
    Ev0ke ultimately held however, showing they have the skill to take on the very
    best and win. \n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nThe Fifth Alliance Tournament Champion is
