- body: "CATCH \u2013 Over the past weeks the G-7WUF system, and its surrounding systems,
    has been the scene of large scale fighting between the Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate
    [IAC] and the Mercenary Coalition [MC]. \n\nThe attack on Conglomerate owned space
    stations in G-7WUF by over 20 Coalition Dreadnaught class vessels started a conflict
    that not only tested the resolve of the IAC, but also triggered several other
    alliances to come to IAC's aid. Despite admitting to heavy losses, the Conglomerate\u2019s
    morale appeared high and through dogged determination and help from allies they
    have managed to retain sovereignty of all their claimed systems. \n\nThe only
    warning that Mercenary Coalition had a contract to oust Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate
    from its home system of G-7WUF was the nearly two dozen cynosural fields heralding
    the appearance of MC Dreadnaughts with the singular purpose of forcing all IAC
    stations into reinforced mode. Over the next week the IAC battled the Mercenaries,
    and their allies in Firmus Ixion [FIX], to hold their claim to G-7WUF. The tide
    of the battle changed though when Curatores Veritatis Alliance [CVA], Axiom Empire
    [AXE], and other friendly alliances came to the aid of the beleaguered IAC. When
    asked if MC was surprised by this development, CEO Seleene of Body Count Inc.,
    the executor corporation of Mercenary Coalition commented, \u201CA bit, but they
    were dealt with \u2026CVA had their fleet destroyed and sent home.\u201D \n\nWhen
    it appeared that the IAC defenders were holding the line, the original unnamed
    contractor apparently hired KIA Corp to help in reinforcing MC. This led to a
    final push by the attackers to take control of G-7WUF. During this pivotal battle
    Tyrrax Thorrk, Spokesperson for IAC, stated \u201CIAC is here to stay and there's
    nothing the MC can do about it, with or without their lackeys in KIA or their
    employers in FIX.\u201D Although there were logistical problems with such a huge
    number of fleet engagements, in the end IAC survived the onslaught and MC withdrew
    from IAC space. KIA Corp soon followed with IAC remaining in control of their
    stations and sovereignty over G-7WUF. \n\nA [ statement](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=413948)
    issued on GalNet by Seleene, revealed that the contract was voided because no
    payment had been made to continue the war and they were unable to contact the
    original client. \n\nThe GalNet is buzzing with conspiracy theories that the attack
    on IAC was a diversion to keep them from helping ASCN in the war with BOB, and
    some say that there never was an anonymous client and MC was helping BOB in their
    efforts. When asked if there was any correlation between the two wars Seleene
    responded, \u201CThus far, no one has paid us to take part in it. Until they do,
    what BOB and ASCN do to each other is not our concern.\u201D"
