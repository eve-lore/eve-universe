- body: "**PR-8CA, Delve** \\- The last two weeks have seen the region of Delve plunged
    into all-out warfare. Sovereignty-holders KenZoku are currently losing sovereignty
    in several systems, while those systems where their claim has held have now secured
    Protectorate sovereignty.\n\n### The War so Far  \n\n\nThe war began when the
    CONCORD-registered Band of Brothers alliance was [disbanded by a director, Arkannen](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?article=2749),
    who defected to the alliance's enemy, GoonSwarm.\n\nThe member corporations of
    Band of Brothers [reformed in KenZoku](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.eveonline.com%2Fwiki%2FKenZoku_\\(Player_alliance\\)),
    previously an industrial alliance for Reikoku-affilliated corporations. Their
    previous Province and Capital sovereignties in the region were lost, but KenZoku
    was able to make a [territorial sovereignty claim](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fevemaps.dotlan.net%2Falliance%2FKenZoku%2Fchanges)
    to systems formerly claimed under the Band of Brothers identity.\n\nKenZoku's
    old enemies - GoonSwarm, Pandemic Legion and the Northern Coalition's RAZOR Alliance
    and Morsus Mihi - launched a full-scale invasion of the region, intending to conquer
    it before full sovereignty over the area could be restored.\n\nThe forces allied
    against KenZoku have attempted to [confine most of the defender's forces](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dr3B12GCT4JY%26e)
    into a Blood Raider Covenant station in PR-8CA and maintain a continual heavy
    guard in the system, while the rest of the attacking forces focus on [removing
    the defending alliance's control towers](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdl.eve-files.com%2Fmedia%2Fcorp%2Fverite%2F20090221.png).\n\nMeanwhile,
    KenZoku's allies Against ALL Authorities are [attacking the former home territories](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fevemaps.dotlan.net%2Falliance%2FGoonSwarm%2Fchanges)
    of GoonSwarm alongside C0ven and Stain Empire. GoonSwarm state that they have
    [abandoned these systems](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fevemaps.dotlan.net%2Falliance%2FGoonSwarm%2Fchanges)
    for the time being and, it is claimed, will [reconquer them](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eveonline.com%2Fingameboard.asp%3Fa%3Dtopic%26threadID%3D1001331%26page%3D2%2342)
    once Delve has fallen.\n\nTo date, KenZoku has lost its [sovereignty claims](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fevemaps.dotlan.net%2Falliance%2FKenZoku%2Fchanges)
    in 44 systems, though it then reclaimed two, while sufficient towers have survived
    to [claim Protectorate sovereignty](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fevemaps.dotlan.net%2Falliance%2FKenZoku%2Fchanges)
    in some 70 systems in Catch, Delve, Querious, Detorid and Period Basis.\n\n###
    Dining in NOL  \n\n\nIn particular, the outpost in NOL-M9 has assumed a symbolic
    importance in the conflict. It is widely rumoured that Goonswarm once vowed to
    dine in NOL-M9, the site of Band of Brother's outpost, The Alamo. (Ownership of
    the outpost passed to KenZoku and is currently with Pandemic Legion, who renamed
    it \"[The Lmao](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fevemaps.dotlan.net%2Fsystem%2FNOL-M9).\")\n\nXxAngelxX
    is CEO of The Illuminati, a Pandemic Legion corporation spoke about the conquest:\n\n\"We
    took it the first day that [sovereignty] dropped, then [KenZoku] retook it but
    we expect to have it back in about a week. We've had more important things to
    do than NOL-M9 recently.\n\n\"Pandemic Legion itself has / is in the process of
    taking FinFleet's sovereignty 4 constellation. We took the first station today
    in 5-6QW7. As for other sovereignty 4 constellations, I believe [GoonSwarm] and
    [the Northern Coalition] are well on their way with those too.\"\n\nSince this
    interview, Pandemic Legion has [completed both these objectives](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fevemaps.dotlan.net%2Fregion%2FDelve),
    holding both NOL-M9 and the 1-A81R constellation. XxAngelxX continued:\n\n\"There
    really has been little resistance. One of the major parts of this has been the
    23/7 perma camp in PR-8CA which was well known to be [KenZoku's]... staging [area]
    and where they told GBC to regroup to, too.\n\n\"With their assets and ships locked
    in station, titans [caged] in their POS and massive issues with security, we haven't
    really seen much fight from them in the last couple of days. We've destroyed [approximately]
    50 large POS in station systems in the last 2 days without resistance.\n\n\"At
    the moment, it's hardly a war. We'll see if [KenZoku] actually have a strategic
    plan after [Against ALL Authorities] finish with [the] old [GoonSwarm] space,
    but right now we are taking this space like no-one ever lived in it....the only
    battles we have had are ganking Shrike, ganking Waagaa's aeon and ganking an [Axiom
    Empire] aeon last night.\"\n\n### \"At Our Own Will\"\n\nLadyScarlet is an officer
    in Destructive Influence, a KenZoku corporation. She gave her perspective on the
    efforts to blockade KenZoku forces inside PR-8CA:\n\n\"If you mean are we locked
    [in], no. We still move at our own will. Of course, it all depends on whom you
    ask - everyone has an opinion on the matter. I like to think we are playing [this]
    our way, not by GoonSwarm's dictations.\n\n\"Sure, there will be [sovereignty]
    flips, but as history has shown, the last time they came here, we took it all
    back. [It's just] a matter of time.\n\n\"They don't have enough people to accomplish
    their goal.\"\n\n### GalNet References\n\n**Interstellar Correspondents News:**
