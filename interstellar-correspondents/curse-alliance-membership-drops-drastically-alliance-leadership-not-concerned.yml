- body: "In the days since the last article on the Curse Alliance, its member count
    went from roughly 2300 to around 700. Although it is impossible for us to confirm
    which corporations have definitively left the Curse Alliance, we received a list
    of those that have taken up Stain Empire\u2019s offer from thebold. These corporations
    have presumably left the Curse Alliance, for various reasons. The list numbers
    around 30.   \n  \nJudging from the number of corporations that are still left,
    these corporations are Kill on Sight to Stain and Xetic forces, it would seem
    that the rumours surrounding the demise of the Curse Alliance are true.   \n  \nI
    had the chance to speak to Foyle, Curse Alliance leader, who denied Curse\u2019s
    death. She explained the departure of Shinra and Supremacy as something those
    corporations had to do, for their own member base\u2019s morale. They are still
    on friendly terms with the Curse Alliance and will be missed by most.   \n  \nWhen
    confronted with the steep decline in members due to the offer of the Stain Empire,
    Foyle had this to say:   \n  \n\"Those corporations are regarded as having superb
    standings, as if they were still part of the curse alliance, regardless of any
    NAP with SE.\"   \n  \nThe corporations that have taken up Stains offer might
    decide to create an alliance in the Great Wildlands region, Foyle will regard
    any ex-CA member of such an alliance as friendly, whilst other members that were
    not a part of the Curse Alliance will be set to Kill on Sight status.   \n  \nOf
    course, I asked her about the Stain ceasefire offer, of which one of the terms
    is disbanding the Curse Alliance, to which she responded that the Curse Alliance
    will not dissolve, for anything.   \n  \nWhen confronted with the rumours that
    some corporations were kicked from the alliance, she made the following statement:
    \  \n  \n\"We felt that some corporations might take the opportunity to remove
    the alliance leadership, in order to comply with SE's demands. Since CA will never
    succumb to politics, I felt that it was necessary to remove some corporations
    from the Alliance. It was a hard decision to make, but unfortunately a needed
    one\"   \n  \nFoyle is sure that many of the corporations understand her decision
    to temporarily remove them from the alliance and is confident that they will take
    up the offer to rejoin at a later date. She explained to me that in the time the
    Curse Alliance has existed, good friendships were forged between people and that
    these corporations are free to re-join the Curse Alliance after the troubles die
    down.   \n  \nFrom my conversation with Foyle, I got the impression that she is
    very confident that the Curse Alliance will be reborn in the near future. Whether
    or not this confidence is misplaced is not sure at this point. Naturally, the
    surviving Curse Alliance will not be as strong as before, with most of its major
    fighting corporations leaving. Still, it is this reporters\u2019 opinion that
    the friendships and bonds forged during Curse\u2019s long existence will make
    sure that this Alliance survives, and will continue to survive, well into the
    future."
