    Heimatar** \\- Following on from a [recent article by The Interstellar Correspondents](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=3452&tid=7),
    G.A.N.J.A. corporation held a non-violent protest in Rens where they and 3 other
    corporations (the identity of which has not been revealed by the G.A.N.J.A. spokesperson)
    self-destructed some 79 ships.   \n  \nThe protesters gathered at the Brutor tribe
    Treasury located at planet VI, moon 8 in Rens; the station is a popular local
    trade hub. G.A.N.J.A's demonstration took the same form as their previous protest
    in Orvolle - they docked in the station, undocked and self-destructed their ships,
    then redocked in their capsules before repeating the process.  \n  \nG.A.N.J.A.
    have warned that this will be their last _non-violent_ protest; the Minmatar Republic
    have made no official response to the protestors' call for compensation for Ammatar
    farmers who suffered damage to their plantations at the hands of a [Minmatar-Thukker
    slave recovery force](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=3367&tid=2).
    \ \n  \nKimberly Hughes, the spokesperson for G.A.N.J.A, expressed outrage at
    the continued silence of the Minmatar Parliament and revealed plans to escalate
    their protests. \"We shall strike at various convoys in the Minmatar State [sic].
    We shall hit the Minmatar where they hit the Ammatar, through their trade; we
    shall try to collapse the economy!\"  \n  \nDespite the peaceful nature of the
    Rens protest, G.A.N.J.A. had difficulties with one capsuleer, who caused some
    disturbance by salvaging wrecks of their destroyed ships. Though G.A.N.J.A. had
    battleships standing by, the protest remained non-violent despite the actions
    of this pilot - a well-known local anti-hero by the name of Menod Penter. Penter,
    known as \"The Mayor of Rens\" has operated in Rens for many years with his small
    crime syndicate, but he also runs a very successful operation selling anchorable
    secure containers.  \n  \nKimberly revealed how G.A.N.J.A. have responded to their
    encounter with the racketeer. \"We have received intelligence about an individual
    who calls himself the 'Mayor of Rens' and we in G.A.N.J.A feel it would be nice
    to have his corpse hanging on meat hooks in our hangers.\"  \n  \nMembers within
    G.A.N.J.A. have recieved orders to kill Mr Penter on sight, as they see him as
    a high-profile target that would help them gain publicity and support for their
    cause. Whether such attempts will result in \"suicide by CONCORD\" or a declaration
    of war will be issued remains to be seen.  \n  \nWith attacks threatened across
    the Minmatar Republic from G.A.N.J.A, Kimberly claimed the silence from the Minmatar
    government only encourages them. \"For every moment that passes, we simply get
    angrier and angrier and plan even yet more cataclysmic consequences.\"\n\n* *
