- body: "PROVIDENCE. A military stand-off following a border dispute between the Curatores
    Veritatis Alliance and the Interstellar Starbase Syndicate earlier this month
    has been resolved peacefully after diplomatic talks. The incident saw the two
    alliances contesting the placement of ISS starbases in relation to CVA territory,
    apparently due to miscommunication that can be blamed on a directors' illness.
    The brief war threatened to disrupt the construction of ISS\u2019s seventy billion
    ISK twin outpost project in the region. \n\nSpeaking in a press release on the
    GalNet Communications Network, Count TaSessine of the ISS reported that the issue
    had been resolved following an agreement with the Amarrian loyalist faction. No
    details were given in the statement, although the ISS chairman explained that
    \u201Cdeployment of the outposts outlined in the ISS Providence project will proceed
    accommodating the agreement reached between ISS and CVA.\u201D \n\nIn an interview
    with the Interstellar Correspondents, Count TaSessine explained that the crisis
    was \u201Cprompted by a misunderstanding between CVA and ISS regarding the extent
    of CVA's claimed space.\u201D The ISS had deployed starbases in the 3KB-J0 solar
    system - an area of providence that they believed to be neutral territory - in
    preparation for deployment of one of their outposts. However, they intended to
    claim the constellation in which 3KB-J0 resides. Construction materials had already
    been shipped to the starbases making it difficult for the ISS to simply abandon
    the site in light of information that was new to them. \n\nWhen asked if there
    was any party directly responsible for the misunderstanding, Count TaSessine was
    keen to avoid blaming anyone for the incident, citing that \u201Cpointing fingers
    is no use at this stage.\u201D Commenting on the CVA\u2019s war declaration at
    the height of the crisis, Count TaSessine remarked that \u201CIt was an overly
    violent reaction to a problem which we could, and would, negotiate a solution
    for.\u201D He went on to add that he thought the reaction was largely due to Amarrian
    pride, explaining that \u201Cwe Caldari are much more pragmatic.\u201D Count TaSessine
    refused to give any details regarding the deal brokered between ISS and CVA, stating
    that a public announcement would be given at an \u201Cappropriate time\u201D in
    the near future. \n\nInterviewed on behalf of the CVA, Aralis of Imperial Dreams
    explained that at the time \u201Cit appeared to be no accident; [ISS] had been
    informed of our claim and after they planted the starbase, a mail to the Count
    produced unhelpful.\u201D He added that he had not been aware of Count TaSessine\u2019s
    illness at the time of the incident and had no way of knowing, \u201CI had expected
    no difficulties at first as a previous incident had been resolved speedily.\u201D
    When talking about the CVA\u2019s decision to go to war with the ISS over the
    incident, Aralis said that after private diplomacy and public demands to remove
    the starbases had proven inadequate, the war was warranted. \u201CThere is no
    way the issue would have been resolved without war I would say.\u201D \n\nAn announcement
    has yet to be made regarding the exact specifics of the deal between ISS and CVA.
    The first ISS Providence outpost was deployed in the IS-R7P solar system in the
    Catch region, on the border with Providence and the 3KB-J0 system."
