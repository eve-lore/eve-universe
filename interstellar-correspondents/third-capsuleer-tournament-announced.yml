- body: "At an open press meeting earlier this morning, representatives from the Caldari
    Gaming Commission announced the exact dates and rules for the next capsuleer alliance
    tournament. This will be the third time the tournament is held, and the Commission
    has promised to make this one bigger and better than before.   \n  \n\u201CThis
    will be our third tournament, and hopefully the most exciting one yet. We have
    many strong contenders out there, and I personally cannot wait to see all the
    new tactics and setups that our new rule system allows for,\u201D said CGC head
    Airas Sukela. \u201CWe have decided that a tournament will be held every six months,
    and to ensure this becomes a reality we have signed a five-year contract with
    Boundless Creation public relations coordinator, Sirfortur Ofarter.\u201D   \n
    \ \nWhen contacted about the contract, Ofarter told reporters that her corporation
    would be making changes to the way prizes are handled and pumping fresh blood
    into the tournament\u2019s promotional and public relations effort. \u201COur
    engineers have been working day and night for months to create these monstrosities.
    The winners of the next tournament will not be going home empty-handed.\u201D
    She was unwilling to divulge further details about the exact nature of the prizes,
    but assured reporters that a detailed press release would be forthcoming.   \n
    \ \nPublic opinion of the contract between CGC and Boundless Creation seems to
    be mixed, especially considering recent political tensions and fluctuations between
    the empires. Extremist voices have challenged the contract\u2019s legality while
    others embrace this as a friendly act.   \n  \nThe capsuleer tournament is scheduled
    to go ahead in two weeks\u2019 time."
