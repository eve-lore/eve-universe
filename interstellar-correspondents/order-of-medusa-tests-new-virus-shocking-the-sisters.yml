- body: "Hedoubel \u2013 Last week, after hearing that The Order of Medusa tried to
    secure a system, The Sisters of EVE sent an armed fleet to investigate and offer
    aid if needed. They found the Order of Medusa were using the station in the system
    and its inhabitants as labrats for a new virus. \n\nWith the help of several capsuleer
    corporations, including The Blessed Sisters of Amarr, Pod Radio, House of Flying
    Daggers, The Crescent Order, Ixion Defense Systems, Phoenix Wing, The Durandal
    Organization and Equilibrium Society, the Sisters were able to reach the station,
    fend of the defending fleet of Medusa pilots and offer aid to the population.
    \n\nSadly, it was too late to save the people. Early results into the nature of
    the virus indicate that it\u2019s a fast working and lethal agent. Logs from the
    stations docking and medical bay indicate that in a matter of hours after the
    first Medusa ship docked the first casualties were reported. \n\nScientists have
    found a flaw in the virus that offers some hope, the virus allows a host to infect
    a very limited amount of others because symptoms show after moments of coming
    into contact with the virus. This is supported by the logs of the station that
    show people immediately went to their quarters complaining of headaches and nausea.
    Research is still ongoing at this moment. \n\nSister Rhayne was equally appalled
    by the actions of The Order of Medusa and Star Fraction, the latter who attacked
    the fleet of the Sisters and others who wanted help. \u2018It\u2019s hard to believe
    that there are organizations who would use the homes of people to test a virus
    that kills so quickly, it\u2019s even harder to imagine capsuleers preventing
    help from arriving. Yet it happens and it proves that our work is not done,\u2019
    Sister Rhayne stated, \xB4I\u2019m afraid we are more needed then ever.\xB4"
