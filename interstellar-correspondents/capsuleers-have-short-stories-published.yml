    Sinq Laison** \u2013 Forty capsuleers that entered a fiction writing competition
    hosted by Max Torps have since had their stories published for all of New Eden
    to read.   \n  \nThe competition asked capsuleers to look at a provided image
    from New Eden and write a short story on how they interpreted the picture.   \n
    \ \nMax Torps explained why he organised the competition: \u201CI'd seen some
    competitions before but felt that they focused more on capsuleer thoughts, opinions
    and feelings. I wanted to see another aspect to their creativity, their fiction
    writing.\u201D   \n  \nMax also revealed his delight at the number of entries
    he received: \u201CWhat really made it take off was when it was announced on the
    New Eden News Network... 117 capsuleers took the time to sit down and write a
    story based on one image. I felt rather humbled but also very excited. It also
    made me determined to see the project through. I spent days reading each entry,
    many of them I read more than once!\u201D   \n  \nWith permission granted from
    40 authors to use their story, he is seeking permission from the remainding 77
    as he believes that \"it's only fair to allow those that have been out of touch
    a chance to be published too\u201D.   \n  \nArcana Mortis, author of \"Inspiration
    Strikes\", one of the 40 so far published, expressed her delight at having the
    piece published: \u201CIt's pretty awesome, if I'd known that was going to happen
    I probably would have written something better though!\u201D   \n  \nKail Toronus,
    author of \"Inner Thoughts of a Vanquished Soul\", another of the 40, revealed
    the need to submit his story: \u201CI just love to write, I've been writing fiction
    stories for a long time now. So, when I saw the competition I knew I wanted to
    submit something.\u201D   \n  \nThe winners of the competition were:   \n  \n1st
    prize of 100 million ISK and 2 PLEX - Ichikhan for his story \"On Rails of Golden
    Fire\".   \n2nd prize of 75 million ISK and 1 PLEX - Lady Ariona for her story
    \"Freedom and Slavery\".   \n3rd prize of 50 million ISK and 1 PLEX - Neologia
    for her story \"Concientious Objector\".   \n  \nOn the back of the success, Max
    Torps also wished to announce that a similar competition will be revealed in the
    coming weeks, with the winner receiving two Pilot Licence Extensions, and one
    for each capsuleer who wins 2nd 3rd and 4th places.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Original
