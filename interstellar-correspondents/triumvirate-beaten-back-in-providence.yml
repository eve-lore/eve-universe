    by Curatores Veritatis Alliance (CVA) and its allies. The attack began just over
    a month ago and was aimed at the X-R3NM system where CVA had placed a cynojammer.
    The final battle was fought between CVA\u2019s (and its allies) fleet of 190 ships
    and Triumvirate\u2019s fleet of 160 ships. \n\nCVA has been involved in what it
    calls Operation Deliverance for a long time in Providence. The goal of the operation
    is to develop the region as an extension of the Amarrian Empire. \n\nTriumvirate\u2019s
    first operation against CVA was to take over the Misaba System. This system is
    a choke point through which traffic in Domain travels to Providence. This action
    crippled CVA\u2019s transportation and logistics networks, and began a period
    of guerilla warfare on the part of the Amarrian defenders to counter Triumvirate\u2019s
    efforts. \n\nTriumvirate countered by trying to force a fleet engagement by attacking
    X-R3NM where CVA has considerable assets including an outpost. This battle ended
    with heavy losses on both sides. \n\nLater, Triumvirate attacked the system again
    and was able to damage the system\u2019s cynojammer and three of CVA\u2019s POSs.
    CVA, along with several allies, countered with a large fleet and drove Triumvirate
    out of the system. \n\nFinally, Triumvirate mounted a third operation against
    X-R3NM. Hardin, of CVA, characterized the outcome of this battle by saying it,
    \u201Cclearly demonstrated to the heretics and heathens CVA\u2019s (and its allies)
    undiminished resolve to build a safe, prosperous and civilized Providence.\u201D
    After this battle Triumvirate returned to its home in the North. \n\n\u201CWe
    fought them tooth and nail and we gave them hell,\u201D said Garreck, CEO of Amarr
    Border Defence Consotrium (a CVA corporation). \u201CBut,\u201D he added, \u201CHaving
    an alliance of that power and skill leave the area, well, we were happy enough
    to just let them go. We had a few skirmishes as they withdrew and left it at that.\u201D
    \n\nWarGod, representing Triumvirate, stated that CVA met them with three or four
    other alliances, including Goonswarm. \u201CWe were forced to pull back our 150
    \u2013 200 man fleet from a total of around 400 hostiles,\u201D he said. \u201CLots
    of space distortions made even fighting out numbered, something we love doing,
    not even nearly possible,\u201D he added. When asked he said Triumvirate has no
    plans for further operations against CVA, at least \u201Cnot anytime soon.\u201D
    WarGod closed his remarks by saying \u201Cwe all learned a lot from it.\u201D
    \n\nIt appears that Providence is safely in CVA\u2019s hand for the moment, and
    that they can continue with Operation Deliverance. Triumvirate will have to look
    elsewhere for a door way into the south."
