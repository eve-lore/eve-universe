    on the above date, one of New Edens most famous citizens, **Chribba** , started
    his second annual LoveQuest.\n\nThe LoveQuest consisted of five events spread
    out over the evening. The five events were:\n\n**Event 1** : Speed Race 1, a race
    from A-Z going via waypoints to see who can get to the end first.\n\n**Event 2**
    : Speed Race 2, more of the same if there are any competitors left from the first
    race.\n\n**Event 3** : Carebears Love, who can deliver the most ore to Chribba
    within a set time period.\n\n**Event 4** : POS Siege, destruction of a tower required.
    Due to the nature of this event it was held in a low security system.\n\n**Event
    5** : Free the loot, grab and escape with what you can.\n\n \n\nThe event was
    very well attended, with over 200 capsuleers taking part in total across the five
    \ contests. All the contestants and spectators agreed that this was one of the
    events of 110 and they are looking forward to the next LoveQuest event held by
    Chribba.\n\nBillions of ISK of prizes were won during  the events including a
    Low-Grade Slave Set with Omega implant, an Orca, Hulk, Ares, Nightmare, Nemesis,
    Manticore, various faction modified ships modules and hundreds of regular modules.\n\nAfter
    the event Chribba said \"I wish to thank you all for participating in this years
    LoveQuest, unfortunately it did not turn out exactly as planned. However, personally
    I think it turned out quite well.\"\n\n \n\n \n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by
