- body: "CATCH. The first publicly owned Outpost, ISS Marginis, has opened for business
    last October 26th.   \n  \nFinished more than one month ahead of schedule, the
    Gallente Administrative-type Outpost located at the KDF-GY system is expected
    to inititate operations with unrestricted access to all pilots regardless their
    affiliation. Docking rights may be reevaluated in case of acts of piracy in the
    Outpost\u2019s and neighboring systems, or due to committing acts of aggression
    towards the ISS Alliance.   \n  \n\u201CWe have deliberately built it in unclaimed
    space, near the highways leading to and from empire space and close to the great
    southern alliances,\u201D announced ISS Chairman Mr. Count TaSessine in their
    press release, \u201Cdesigned to be a trade hub, and we hope that in time, it
    will become the new Yulai of the southern 0.0 regions. We have chosen a Gallente
    Administrative Outpost which, to our knowledge, is the first outpost of this type
    in Eve, for its market and office facilities to promote commerce.\u201D   \n  \nAccording
    to Mr. TaSessine, \u201CThe ISS Navy will enforce the neutrality of the system\u201D,
    although whether or not such objective will be indeed possible is subject to ample
    debate. \u201CISS takes a pretty big gamble\u201D said pod-pilot political analyst
    Rod Blaine, \u201Con being able to walk the standing tightrope well enough to
    avoid anyone in the area stepping in and removing them.\u201D   \n  \nTechnically
    owned by the ISS Marginis Outpost Corporation [ISSMO], the project was financed
    through a 3-phase Initial Public Offering held at the beginning of October, in
    which 3600 shares at 10m Isk per unit were acquired in less than 10 days, the
    first operation of its kind and volume among the pod-pilot community.   \n  \nAs
    yet another original marketing move, insta-jump bookmarks to the station will
    be available on the market through escrow for a nominal fee, both in the Marginis
    system and in 0.0 entry systems. The bookmarks are offered to be freely traded
    between pod-pilots, corporations and alliances.   \n  \nThe Outpost will offer
    Market and Docking facilities to the general public, and four Offices are currently
    being auctioned; factories and labs are at present only available to ISS member
    corporations"
