- body: "Azia Burgi's cemetery was destroyed earlier this week by the JihadSwarm faction
    of GoonSwarm. Dozens of corpses have been stolen and several surviving caskets
    have been defaced.\n\nForgotten by many, the cemetery was the solo project of
    Azia Burgi. As reported in an article early this year, Azia \"\u2026thought it
    was a little sad that people just left their victims corpses alone in space after
    such a violent death. \" Azia began collecting these corpses and placing them
    in secure \"caskets\" to be anchored in her cemetery.\n\nThe report of her cemetery
    project sparked some interest from the pod pilot community, and the number of
    donations has produced a staggering backlog of 5,000 corpses. Jay Marshall remarked:
    \"The EVE Cemetery is a monument to those fallen in battle. A place where one
    can go and say those final words they would like to the fallen, and even though
    we are in a clone-age, where one really doesn't die, the bodies entombed around
    the cemetery are both a reminder and warning about our own mortality.\"[![Casket

    the cemetery also attracted the attention of Karttoon, leader of JihadSwarm; \"I
    ordered JihadSwarm to destroy the Cemetery in order to set free the desecrated
    and defiled bodies, stolen and trapped in mass graves to be put on display and
    gawked at as personal possessions of a vile woman. The deceased must be buried
    on planets, wrapped in our ritual shroud, and positioned to face in the direction
    of the temple of Qu'Lah.\" [Sesfan Qu'Lah was a revered GoonSwarm CEO -ed.].\n\n\"GoonSwarm
    believes in freedom of religion, as long it is righteous. I doubt any of the \"tenants\"
    had the opportunity to state their beliefs before they were dragged into this
    prison. It is my duty as leader of JihadSwarm to enforce the moral standards of
    the one true god.\"\n\nThe GoonSwarm/JihadSwarm position was verified by Zapawork,
    the official diplomatic representative of GoonSwarm.\n\nThe attack on the cemetery's
    control tower commenced at a time when Azia Burgi was dealing with personal business
    planetside. In addition to the destruction of the control tower, weak encryption
    protocols allowed JihadSwarm pilots to steal dozens of corpses and desecrate several
    of the empty caskets with such phrases as \"xiut was here\" and \"can't stop the
    fofo\". Of the 700 caskets originally anchored, only a hundred or so still remain.\n\nDespite
    the destruction of her work, Azia remains committed to her project and has said,
    \"As always the cemetery project is neutral and any corpse I receive from GoonSwarm
    will be treated with dignity and respect as are all the deceased. To the community
    in general: Thank you for your continued support please keep the corpse donations
    coming. Normal service will be resumed as is humanly possible.\"\n\nKarttoon has
    already vowed to launch another attack; \"unless she is willing to change her
    burial methods so that they are in line with our beliefs. She is always free to
    contact me if she is interested in coming to a peaceful solution.\""
