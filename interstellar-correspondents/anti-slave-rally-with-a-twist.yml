- body: "Yulai, the centre for trade, diplomacy and travel, last Sunday played host
    to yet another chapter in the ensuing conflict of interests between the Amarrian
    slavers and the anti-slaver factions.   \n  \nAlthough the various systems have
    seen many rallies with the aim of freeing the slaves in mind, this one was slightly
    different. Instead of being organised and run by a Minmatar freedom fighter corporation
    or alliance, this one was initiated by an Amarrian citizen.   \n  \nShira d'Radonis,
    a member of the Abolition Party of Amarr lead the gathering, calling for an end
    to slavery, which she believes is hurting the Empire by suppressing the free market,
    undercutting the wages of Amarrian citizens.   \n  \nWhile other plots and groups
    were in attendance campaigning for an end to slavery for humanitarian reasons,
    the focus was more on the economic, with Shira delivering her message to the pilots
    in the system, and fiercely defending her viewpoint from all who disagreed with
    her.   \n  \nShira had to defend herself from numerous people calling her a \u201Ctraitor\u201D
    to her race, to which she replied, \u201CI am a devout Amarrian, I keep the Pax
    Amarria by my bed always. But I don't agree with some of the practices of our
    society. I don't want to overthrow the Emperor or our Faith, merely to bring freedom
    to everyone. All men have the right to be free.\u201D   \n  \nCVA representative
    Siobhan was less than impressed with the Amarr anti-slavery movement, pointing
    out its lack of support. She cited an earlier, less well publicised rally which
    it is claimed was used as a front to attack the CVA, and even in that instance
    the numbers who showed up were minimal.   \n  \nRepresentatives and pilots from
    the Ushra\u2019kahn alliance, a group of Minmatar who are fighting for their enchained
    people\u2019s freedom, were few and far between at this rally, and those that
    were there had to defend themselves against the CVA, who took it upon themselves
    to combat \u201Cknown terrorists who interfere in our affairs, who slander our
    traditions and culture\u201D.   \n  \nEven so, Hamish, a top board member from
    Ushra\u2019kahn, applauded the rally, saying that the fact some Amarrian people
    were willing to see the issue from their viewpoint was vindicating. \u201CTheir
    reasons for supporting the abolition of slavery are irrelevant. The end result
    will be the same, no matter why people work towards it \u201C.   \n  \nShira d\u2019Radonis
    said at the end that she had made many new friends and supporters at the rally,
    and planned to hold more events of this nature in the future. Whatever happens
    though, this is the first major incidence of Amarrian citizens openly speaking
    out about one of the foundations of their culture."
