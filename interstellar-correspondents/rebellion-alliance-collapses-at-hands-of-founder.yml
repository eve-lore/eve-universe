    2X** \\- It has emerged that Rebellion Alliance [-R-] [was dissolved last week](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=4397&tid=7)
    by the hands of its leader due to suspected embezzlement by many of its high ranking
    members.[![Daroh - Founder of RA](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4406/imagethumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4406/image.png)\u200B
    \ \n  \nThe founder of -R-, Daroh, alleges that those within the leadership of
    -R- used the alliance to capture space, simply so that resources could be mined
    from the alliance\u2019s moons. Instead of reinvesting the profits from those
    moons, he claims that those involved then tampered with the funds from the sale
    of the materials that were mined, effectively using -R- as a tool to earn ISK
    for themselves.  \n  \nDaroh promptly responded by dissolving the alliance. A
    leaked open letter, attributed to Daroh, states: \"Hope you will understand what
    I did. I know that simple analysis of events loudly shouts to your mind that I'm
    a traitor, but try to get my point of view.\"  \n  \nDaroh could neither be reached
    for comment nor for verification of his statement.  \n  \nMassive fleet fights
    are still occurring over many of the resource-rich moons that were left behind
    by the disbanding of Rebellion Alliance. However, many of the member corporations
    have stayed intact and have moved to neighboring alliances.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you
