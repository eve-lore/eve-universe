    Cartel Corporation and Scrapper Secura of Knockout Inc.The duel, organised by
    Ronaldo \u2018Green Eyes\u2019 Ling, concluded in a victory for Tank CEO.\n\nM.
    Ling, a dual organiser and promoter self titled \u2018Fight Promoter Extraordinaire\u2019,
    announced that his prize fighter Scrapper Secura was seeking a skilled pilot to
    fight against. Tank CEO accepted the challenge and engaged Scrapper\u2019s Deimos
    in his Cerberus. The two seemed evenly matched, though Scrapper\u2019s capacitor
    gave in near the end of the fight. His Deimos was destroyed, leaving little debris.
    M. Ling is left with a debt in excess of 30 Million ISK to the residents of Jita
    who placed a bet on the winner. \n\nTank CEO spared Scrappers capsule from destruction,
    voiding his prize. After the duel Tank commented simply \u2018He went boom\u2019
    on the destruction of the other vessel. Tank had 300million ISK riding on the
    fight, including the cost of his own vessel, a Cerberus fitted entirely with top
    notch modules. He stated \u201CI don't care; I just wanted to fight even though
    I wasn\u2019t going to get a reward, all good fun.\u201D When asked about his
    history he openly said \u201CI\u2019m a pirate that\u2019s always looking for
    people who loot worth billions in their cargo, to blow up and profit on. Your
    cargo equals my profit\u201D. He finished the interview by stating \u201CYea,
    just wanted to say good fight to Scrapper Sacura, was fun. Also, for all those
    of you out there doing the same thing I\u2019m doing, stay out of Jita! It\u2019s
    mine.\u201D \n\nScrapper Secura remarked \u2018Well, I was ready, but that Tank
    guy, he's a real pro. He just hit me and kept on hitting me no matter what I threw
    at him\u2019. \n\nScrapper Secura appeared upset after the duel, lamenting over
    his lost ship and fearing for his own future. He was concerned that he may be
    sold into slavery after losing the duel to Tank CEO, a concern not dispelled by
    his promoter and sponsor, Ronaldo Ling. During the interview, M. Ling said that
    he may be unable to pay back all of the bets and was going to have to take drastic
    measures to raise funds to do so and to replace the lost vessel. \u2018Well, I
    have some coats I don't wear no more, and I could sell my ship. Free up some shares
    of Knockout Inc...\u2019 he commented."
