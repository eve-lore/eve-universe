    enough. For some, you need to rub the face of your detractors in it too, to the
    tune of billions. Such is the nature of the latest frenzied betting that has exploded
    on GalNet since the Matari commentator Calmdown made derogatory remarks about
    the Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate. The current amount wagered between all
    parties sits at a whopping 14 billion ISK. \n\nSpurned by his comments made across
    live holo-vision to thousands of capsuleers, proud Amarrian and IAC leader Tyrrax
    Thorrk called the Matari commentator on his observations \u2013 demanding he \u201Cput
    his money where his mouth is\u201D. Offering to place a two billion ISK wager
    on winning the next match against Cosa Nostra., Thorrk invited Calmdown to match
    her offer. One he has so far refused to see her on. In spite of this, the current
    amount wagered by other parties now sits at a jaw dropping seven billion ISK,
    an amount equaled by Thorrk. \n\n\u201CI'm serious about the bet and I know Calmdown
    can afford it. If he doesn't have the cahones to stand by his \u2018expert\u2019
    opinion perhaps one of you other fine gentlemen will rise to the challenge?\u201D
    goaded Thorrk, when no response from the Matari has arrived after some time. It
    wasn\u2019t long until another wealthy pod pilot, in this instance, Triumvirate.\u2019s
    Jovius Marginus, stepped forward to bet against IAC\u2019s success. He first wagered
    five billion ISK and then later topped it off casually with another two. At the
    time of writing he is still opening his wallet to more contenders. \n\nMany capsuleers
    wasted little time in mocking Tyrrax, who has something of a mixed history regarding
    the payment of betting debts owed. A large number of them pointed to the unsettled
    debt she owed to Pilk of Axiom Empire from a bet made long ago, one which Thorrk
    once explained was unpaid due to Pilk\u2019s \u201Crather distasteful actions.\u201D\n\nThis
    has all changed in the last day however, and Thorrk has promised to not only use
    a third party (in this case, the ever-reliable Chribba \u2013 who has since confirmed
    he will act as the middle man) but also repay Pilk\u2019s debt in the process,
    regardless of the outcome of tomorrow\u2019s match. It wasn\u2019t until these
    promises were made that Marginus stopped mocking her himself and stepped up to
    the betting plate.\n\nThe Amarr Certified News, who is covering this year\u2019s
    tournament for the planetary masses, ran the story under the headline \u201CBigger
    than BIG\u201D. It was a reference to the betting run this year by TornSoul, which
    despite having seen multiple billions of ISK wagered has been utterly dwarfed
    by this latest round of gambling. It has indeed been a big day of betting so far,
    with some losing huge amounts on backed favorites that never made it, and others
    simply losing out for betting at all. It\u2019s not all bad news however. The
    recent scandals and now this latest wager amongst capsuleers has drawn record
    interest in the tournament. \n\n\u201CThis is what we like to see,\u201D said
    Reisha Aiokla, a Deteis bookkeeper currently working the crowds at a large spectators
    stadium on Urlen I. \u201CPride and prestige are obviously important, but it\u2019s
    the huge betting between the eggers that really draws the Caldari crowds here\u2026and
    lures them into making some hefty wagers themselves, of course.\u201D\n\nStay
    tuned tomorrow, as the Interstellar Correspondents and Eve TV bring you the latest
    live coverage across the GalNet and holo-vision mediums. No matter which way it
    goes, the seventh fight of the day between IAC and Cosa Nostra. is no doubt sure
    to entertain.\n\n_Related GalNet Communication_  \n[View](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=719024)_"
