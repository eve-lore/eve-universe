    The Forge** \\- Earlier today, the SOMER.blink lottery service was robbed of approximately
    110  billion ISK by one of its administrators.   \n  \n[![](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4228/daquarisportraitthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4228/daquarisportrait.png)\u200BDaquaris,
    a long-time aquaintance of SOMER Blink [BL.NK] corporation CEO Autumnries Mahm,
    withdrew ship hulls and what liquid ISK was accessible to him. He then sold the
    majority of the stolen assets back to SOMER Blink for an alleged 94 billion ISK;
    SOMER Blink were interested in reacquiring the stolen assets to save the time
    and considerable effort involved in sourcing them anew.   \n  \nIn an interview,
    Daquaris confirmed that \"a large amount of security\" hadn't been thought necessary
    \"with such a core group of people\" and explained that he \"felt someone was
    going to rip it off sooner or later\", and that it was \"an [awful] lot of assets.\"
    \  \n  \nAndrev Nox, a member of BL.NK leadership, published an official statement
    explaining that the damage caused by the theft was \"not Blink-destroying.\" The
    corporation had prepared for the possibility of theft by splitting up their capital
    and assets to ensure liquidity in case of a theft by any one employee.   \n  \nSomerset
    Mahm, who first brought public attention to the lottery through the official thread
    on GalNet, also commented, stating: \"It happens! Prizes going out as normal.\"
    \  \n  \nWhen asked about SOMER.blink's service in general, capsuleer TYKONDEROGA
    explained that his attitude towards the lottery did not change because of the
    scam and that he \"could see them making [up] for that loss in no time\". He also
    commended their \"very quick, [professional] service \" and said he would still
    recommend SOMER.blink to others (\"It gives you that 'gambling' feel like sitting
    at a blackjack table \").   \n  \nAttempts have been made to contact Daquaris,
    Andrev Nox, Somerset and Autumnries Mahm again as well as others, however, they
    were not available for further comment at time of writing. The Interstellar Correspondents
    will of course follow the situation closely and publish a follow-up article if
    need be.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[SOMER.blink thread on GalNet](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1384286&page=1)
