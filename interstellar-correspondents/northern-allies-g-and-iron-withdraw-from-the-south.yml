- body: "Last week saw the organised withdrawal of G & IRON forces from the ASCN territories
    of Impass and Feythabolis, following several weeks of fierce fighting in the southern
    fringe regions.   \n  \nThe conflict, which has in recent weeks seen much coverage
    and interest on the GalNet communications network, has sparked considerable speculation
    regarding the reasons for the unexpected move. A number of observers have suggested
    that the recent capture of an IRON outpost in their home region of Deklein by
    BOB forces may have proven to be sufficient impetus for their abandonment of the
    southern campaign.   \n  \nSpeaking in an interview on Monday, Buddrow, leader
    of IRON, was quick to dispel the rumours, stating that: \u201CWe deemed our objectives
    complete with ASCN and we accomplished far more than we set out to do, this war
    was merely to prove a point.\u201D He later went on to add that with the arrival
    of BOB forces in Deklein it was \u201Conly logical to not only fight the better
    of the opponents but to fight closer to home\u201D saying that he hoped for a
    larger and more intense war than the southern campaign.   \n  \nWhen asked about
    the recent loss of their refinery outpost in the JU-OWQ solar system, Buddrow
    explained that it was a loss which had been anticipated in their absence and was
    deemed a necessary sacrifice. Explaining that IRON had not become what it was
    because of its stations, he stated G is a brotherhood that \u201Clives for war\u201D
    and understands the risks associated with it. He later added that the outpost\u2019s
    retrieval would not necessarily be a primary objective in the coming conflict
    with BOB.   \n  \nThe IRON leader went on to explain that recent upgrades to capsule
    interface software, deployed last Thursday, were posing logistical problems for
    the IRON fleet's withdrawal. He remarked that whole convoys were constantly becoming
    \u2018stuck\u2019 as a result of the software changes and stargate malfunctions
    that have posed similar problems to capsuleer pilots across the EVE cluster over
    the weekend.   \n  \nCommenting on the withdrawal, Liquidism, a pilot for the
    G Alliance, stated that G\u2019s main reason for the departure was because \u201CIRON
    and G are brothers in arms, and defending our allies\u2019 space is of greater
    importance for us right now.\u201D When asked if she viewed the conflict as over,
    she stated that although she felt the southern campaign was very successful, \u201Csome
    of our squads will remain in ASCN space.\u201D   \n  \nGoberth Ludwig, ASCN pilot,
    refuted Liquidism\u2019s sentiments, saying: \u201CI don\u2019t think the war
    is ending, it\u2019s just moving away from our home,\u201D adding that he felt
    his leaders would pursue G and IRON north to continue the conflict. When asked
    to give his opinion on the conflict, Ludwig went on to say: \u201CI think it\u2019s
    the first huge war ASCN sustained considering the perseverance and ability of
    our enemies.\u201D He went on to explain that despite heavy losses the alliance
    had survived, and he was in no doubt that the \u201Cconflict strengthened the
    unity of ASCN as a whole.\u201D   \n  \nFor now, the war between G Alliance, IRON
    and ASCN seems to be at an end. With a new war in the northern fringes between
    BOB and IRON looming, it remains to be seen whether ASCN will pursue their enemies
    north."
