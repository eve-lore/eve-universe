    with a first prize consisting of an Erebus class titan.  \n  \nThe winning ticket
    holder will receive the Erebus including modules and rigs. At current market rates,
    similar vessels can sell for as much as 85 to 100 billion ISK depending on fittings.
    \  \n  \n[![The First Place Prize: An Erebus Titan](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3228/erebusthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F3228%2Ferebus.png)In
    addition to the first place jackpot, a second place prize will be a Moros class
    dreadnought, and third place will be awarded a Thanatos class carrier.  \n  \nChribba
    acknowledges that flying a titan is not a skillset common among most of New Eden's
    capsuleers. In the event of the winner not being able to pilot the Erebus, an
    auction will be held on their behalf: \"the winner will get something out of it
    for sure, be it the ship or a large addition to [his] wallet,\" he explained.
    \ \n  \nTicket price will be 10 million ISK and 10,000 tickets will be put on
    sale. Chribba expects to draw the winner \"as soon as all the 10,000 tickets has
    been sold\" or if the lottery deadline is met.  \n  \nInterstellar Correspondents
    will report further details as soon as they are made available.\n\n \n\n**GALNET
