    **Jita, The Forge** \\- A fourth Hulkageddon event, scheduled for 02.113, was
    announced on Galnet yesterday. Organised by infamous pilot Helicity Boson of The
    Jerk Cartel, Hulkageddon is a contest where pilots compete to destroy the most
    Exhumer-class mining vessels, particularly highly-profitable Hulks.   \n  \nHulkageddon
    will take place in February of next year and Helicity Boson has started gathering
    prizes for next year's competition, with many pilots and alliances already stepping
    up to contribute and suggest categories for awards. In a novel move, pilot ElJo123
    of Chains of Chaos has offered [a prize of an unfitted Hulk](http://www.eve-search.com/thread/1422472/page/2#43)
    to the first Retriever pilot to lose their ship in the event, though hopefuls
    should note he claims he was drunk at the time.   \n  \nPrevious events have shown
    the response from miners to be surprisingly mixed. While many ardently oppose
    Hulkageddon and demand CONCORD action, others have abandoned their mining vessels
    for the event and joined the hunt in an effort to thin out competition - particularly
    from unmanned, robotic mining vessels - and drive ore and mineral prices up. Last
    year, however, Helicity was quite clear that the event is not altruistic in any
    way, describing it as \"mean-spirited\" and focused on harvesting \"delicious
    tears\" from miners.   \n  \nThe last Hulkageddon event saw over two thousands
    mining ships destroyed, a figure that next year's event is hoping to beat. XenosisReaper
    of Intrepid Crossing said \"Last time over 2000 Hulks met their glorious end,
    this time let's aim higher.\" He went on to say that pilots should send prizes
    to Orichalcum in Jita, but Helicity Boson has stated that he is not part of Hulkageddon's
    organization and [pilots should not send prizes to him](http://www.eve-search.com/thread/1422472/page/1#1).
    \  \n  \nA [\"HULKAGEDDON 4: Counter-action Guide for Miners\"](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1422548&page=1#1)
    has already been published, offering a guide on protecting mining ships during
    the competition. While CONCORD will act to punish those who attack unflagged vessels
    in high-security space, most Hulkageddon hunters prepare high quantities of ships
    that can kill a mining ship before CONCORD can destroy them, with Ruptures, Thrashers
    and Catalysts being popular in past events. Insurance payouts then cover the cost
    of ships lost to CONCORD.   \n  \nPundits anticipate a rise in ore prices near
    the end of January as many miners dock up for February's Hulkageddon and the illegal
    \"Open Season\" on Hulks, also referred to as the \"Miner's Holiday,\" and many
    systems are expected to experience short supply of destroyers and high impact
    weaponry such as projectile artillery and neutron blasters.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you
