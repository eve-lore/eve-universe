    to \"bring reform to the Amarr Empire by any means necessary and provide aid to
    those free-thinking Amarrian citizens oppressed by their own tyrannical government\".
    \  \n  \nThe competition has so far received interest from both Amarr and Sansha
    loyalists.   \n  \nThe latter refuse to talk exclusively of hate, with ValentinaDLM
    of Zaratha Zarati stating: \"I do hope that when Master Kuvakei decides to show
    the Empire and Republic what unity feels like, that they will finally understand
    there was never a need for conflict.\"   \n  \nOn the other hand, Amarr loyalists
    such as Rodj Blake of PIE Inc., dismiss the award as a meaningless show of hatred:
    \"The enemies of Amarr are not motivated by a desire to create a better world,
    but by hatred of the existing order. Because they primarily seek destruction rather
    than construction, they collectively have little idea what it is that they want
    to replace the Empire with.\"   \n  \nAs a reward to the best participant, to
    be chosen by Kazzzi himself, Heathen Legion plans to award a Revelation-class
    dreadnought that was manufactured from blueprints they salvaged from a destroyed
    Amarr loyalist starbase.   \n  \nThe Interstellar Correspondents will monitor
    this contest and publish a follow-up once a winner has been chosen.\n\n### GalNet
