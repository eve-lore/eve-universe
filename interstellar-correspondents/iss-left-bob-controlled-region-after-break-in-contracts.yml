- body: "The Interstellar Starbase Syndicate has recently come across a bump in the
    road in the form of the once hospitable Band of Brothers Alliance. With a swift
    turn around in policy BoB gave ISS just three days to vacate their space, after
    recently renegotiating its contracts with the ISS. \n\nFor many months the ISS
    has had access to the Period Basis region, a BoB controlled territory, to set-up
    and maintain their Starbases deep in lawless space. While the terms of the contracts
    binding both parties remain undisclosed, BoB believed to be of benefit to the
    ISS. \n\nThe ISS being a civilian organization rely on their Charter to control
    the corporations within its alliance. After a number of suspected breaches in
    BoB security, that were traced back to secure shared communication channels between
    BoB and the ISS, BoB requested that the ISS re-evaluate its security procedures.
    \n\nSerenity Steele, Co-Founder and Executor of the ISS commented regarding recent
    events. She said \u201CThe ISS will require that member corps complete a certain
    level of security before being allowed to join\u201D but she pointed out that
    \u201CSecurity tools only reduce the risk, they don't eliminate it\u201D. When
    discussing the recent events she made clear that they attempted to resolve breeches
    in security as they arose, however BoB failed to take action on suggested resolutions.
    \n\nSerenity Steele was said that BoB refused to set the recommended standings
    in the past, to ensure only those that needed access was permitted it. \u201CThe
    ISS corps in period basis would be friendly, the ISS corps not in period basis
    would be shown as neutral. This was to eliminate the possible routes for information
    leaks.\u201D \n\nAfter an incident where an ISS pilot was seen flying and attacking
    BoB pilots the ISS were informed that their contracts were terminated. They had
    been given three days to remove their belongings from deep lawless space, approximately
    ten freighter loads or equipment and numerous personnel. The ISS immediately attempted
    to open political discussions with BoB but were faced with a wall of silence.
    BoB had made its mind up. \n\nShrike, Evolution commented on the actions taken
    by BoB. He was said that BoB had a simplistic view \u201CWe live by the gun. We
    are creating an empire with whatever means it takes.\u201D When I asked Shrike
    about negotiations she replied that: \u201CThe gun is the biggest negotiator,
    the biggest guns set the rules.\u201D This philosophy is rife throughout the history
    of BoB. From its humble roots as a mobile combat force, BoB has grown to become
    one of the largest territorial Alliances in the EvE Universe. \n\nBoB space is
    a no go zone for all but the chosen few, as anyone who has strayed to close will
    testify. The ISS was granted access but when questioned if BoB offers access to
    others, the response was clear. \u201CNo.\u201D Shrike went on to add that it
    is a question that will not be discussed or answered. While unwilling to comment
    on any \u2018teething\u2019 issues that BoB had with the ISS settlers, Shrike
    made it clear that BoB viewed the recruitment policy of ISS in a less than favourable
    way. \n\nShrike carried on stating that after various security leaks, scouting
    for enemies and supplying enemies of BoB, that they were on a knife-edge with
    the ISS. Her description of ISS\u2019 recruitment policy was \u201Coh wow, another
    pilot/corp that wants in, we'll take anything\u201D. She went on to conclude that
    after informing the ISS of these allegations that the ISS failed to address the
    situation. The final nail in the ISS coffin was when an ISS pilot opened fire
    on a BoB member whilst flying with enemies of BoB. BoB\u2019s thoughts on the
    matter were clear; \u201CIf they can\u2019t control a pilot, they can\u2019t control
    a corporation, and if they can\u2019t control their corporations, they can\u2019t
    control the alliance.\u201D \n\nThe contract between BoB and the ISS was then
    rescinded with immediate effect allowing a grace period of three days to withdraw
    from the regions. BoB are notorious in its \u2018shoot first and ask questions
    later\u2019 attitude, which makes the following comment from Shrike surprising
    \u201Cif it would have been any other entity we would have destroyed them instead
    of giving them three days to vacate space\u201D. \n\nThe withdrawal from BoB space
    went without disturbance and even pulled the ISS closer together according to
    Serenity Steele. Both alliances have stated that there is no animosity or bad
    feelings over this incident towards each other. It was only business. The ISS
    have said that they are willing to work with BoB in the future and BoB reciprocated
    adding \u201CIf they have anything we want, maybe.\u201D \n\nIn an intriguing
    move BoB has started negotiations with several of the ISS corporations that once
    inhabited the Period Basis region to allowed them access once again if BoB deems
    fit. The ISS has passed on its best wishes to these corporations, Serenity Steele
    sees this as a good opportunity for such corporations as clearly stated in the
    ISS charter. BoB declined to comment as to whether any corporations had been successful
    in regaining access. \n\nThis is a far cry from the BoB that most of us have come
    to known. In the past months BoB has allowed industrials into their space and
    they granted mercy to the ISS when you consider they were given a grace period.
    Is this a move by BoB away from its traditional ways of the gun or is it a sign
    of bigger things to come? Only time will tell."
