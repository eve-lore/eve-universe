    sparking a modicum of controversy and speculation on the GalNet Communications
    Network as to the future of the two Pro-Amarr factions and the fate of Providence
    \u2013 a lawless region which shares its borders with the south eastern edge of
    the Amarr Empire.   \n  \nSpeaking in a statement on Wednesday, Gaven Lok'ri \u2013
    CEO of PIE Inc, said that his organisation would be returning to \u201Cthe heartland
    of the Empire\u201D where in the absence of an Emperor \u201Cdefenders are needed
    to guard the home against all threats that might come against it\u201D. PIE Inc
    had previously been working as members of the CVA whose goals, as Alexander Rahl
    of Imperial Dreams stated, were to \u201Cmake the Providence region an extension
    of our great Ammar nation\u201D.   \n  \nWhen asked to comment on the suggestions
    that the CVA had been weakened by the recent events, Rahl stated that \u201CPIE
    will ever remain our most trusted allies in defending the Empire\u201D going on
    to add that the CVA\u2019s \u201Cresolve has strengthened and the Empire is in
    safer hands now than ever before\u201D. This opinion was shared by Scius \u2013
    a Captain within PIE Inc who remarked that \u201CThough PIE left the CVA Amarrians
    need not to worry, our two forces, together with all the loyalist Amarrian corporations,
    will keep the Empire safe! Amarr Victor!\u201D   \n  \nReacting to the split,
    Maggot of the Minmatar faction - Ushra\u2019Khan stated that the \u201Cbreaking
    up of the CVA\u201D was no surprise to his organisation, suggesting the act was
    \u201Cclearly mirroring the decay of the Amarr Empire\u201D. When sharing his
    opinion on last week\u2019s events, BornToKill of \u2018The Sudden Death Squad\u2019
    Alliance said that he felt \u201Cas with any long conflict, the CVA have had inner
    disagreements that has resulted in different interest for PIE and the rest of
    CVA\u201D which consequently caused the split.   \n  \nThe Providence region has
    seen fierce fighting in recent months between the CVA and its enemies The Sudden
    Death Squad Alliance, who claim ownership over the region and the lower Domain
    area to the north in Amarr space. When asked why they were fighting for these
    areas, BornToKill stated that they were of \u201Csentimental\u201D value, later
    going on to say that the TSDS planned to \u201Coccupy lower Domain and Providence
    constructing their own stations in Providence\u201D and ultimately securing the
    area for themselves.   \n  \nWhen commenting on the conflict so far, BornToKill
    said that he thought the fighting was \u201Ceven handed. We win some of the battles
    and in turn so do they\u201D. Remarking that his enemies were \u201Ca very honourable
    group to fight\u201D and that while \u201Ca peaceful solution would be nice for
    all involved, I feel it will end in a full Military victory for TSDS\u201D. Later
    stating that the Sudden Death Squad were \u201Chere to stay\u201D.   \n  \nUpon
    asking Alexander Rahl for his opinions on the conflict, he stated that the TSDS
    \u201Cstill persist there but our resolve will not falter as we have our Faith
    to sustain us\u201D, going on to suggest that the CVA had the upper hand in the
    conflict, remarking that \u201Cif you were to believe TSDS spin doctors on GalNet
    they would have you believe they were winning this war but our Kill Ratio defies
    their optimism\u201D.   \n  \nThe Providence conflict is not limited to the CVA
    and TSDS Alliances however, with CVA allies the Huzzah Federation fighting against
    the TSDS, The Priory, and elements of the Ushra\u2019Khan. When asked about the
    Ushra\u2019Khan\u2019s involvement in the Providence conflict, Maggot stated that
    the \u201CUshra'khan will not shy away from fighting against those that support
    the institutions of slavery\u201D, going on to explain that the U\u2019K had begun
    a campaign against those corporations and institutions that worked alongside the
    CVA or had been proven to be involved in slavery. Stating that as a result of
    their military support for the CVA in Providence, the Huzzah Federation had become
    a major target for Ushra'khan forces.   \n  \nWhen commenting on the rumours that
    the U\u2019K had signed a Non aggression treaty with the TSDS and local pirate
    elements, Maggot remarked \u201CI will be honest with you. Many of the Ushra'khan
    would do business with anyone to see the end of slavery, however the majority
    to do not feel this way and are aggressively anti-pirate\u201D."
