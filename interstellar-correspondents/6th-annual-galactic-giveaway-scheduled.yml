    **Jita, The Forge** \\- On 23.12.112, capsuleer Holiday Spirit will be holding
    his 6th Annual Galactic Giveaway, inviting pilots from across New Eden to gather
    and celebrate a traditional seasonal festival.   \n  \nAs in previous years, the
    event will take place in high security space to prevent violent incidents and
    Holiday Spirit has said that everyone is welcome to join the celebration and spread
    the festive mood.   \n  \nTraditionally, every attendant will receive a present,
    which Spirit says come in \"all shapes and sizes, but I try to keep them within
    your race.\" There are further drawings throughout the night for additional prizes.
    \  \n  \nNiquita Serov and Tuttomenui II are two of the pilots planning to attend.
    Both said that the celebration was a great idea. Serov especially fancied capsuleers
    being \"in the giving mood, especially around this festive time of year.\" Tuttomenui
    had attended the previous two events and stated \"I enjoy having conversations
    with these people. The conga lines are also quite fun as well.\"   \n  \nThe location
    of Holiday Spirit's Annual Galactic Giveaway will be announced on 23.12.112 in
    both the capsuleer Help channel and the [announcement thread on GalNet](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1432012)
    when Mr. Spirit is ready to begin, whereupon capsuleers can migrate to the system
    to join the celebration and receive prizes. He further stated \"The special 'grand'
    prize this year is a fully T2 fit Command ship, with ALL the trimmings.\"\n\n###
