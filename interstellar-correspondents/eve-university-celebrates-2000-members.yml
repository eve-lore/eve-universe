    Media Manager for EVE University, was very pleased that such a high number of
    members had been recruited, but emphasised that it was business as usual: \"Realistically
    it's quite a big thing, but no more daunting than say, last week when we had 1900
    members.\"   \n  \nZeroniss believes EVE University to be \"one of the few corporations
    in New Eden that while exploring a wide variety of content, is still very friendly
    and welcoming for new capsuleers\". She added that the membership landmark also
    emphasises the \"need for an expanding infrastructure\" as more pilots require
    \"more resources, more teachers and more staff\".   \n  \nChrysler Cruiser, a
    new member, told how for him the University is \"a good experience\".   \n  \nTo
    celebrate the 2000th member joining the corporation, EVE University will be allowing
    students to open up a question and answer session with University staff, concluding
    with a \"student Vs staff\" combat session.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[EVE University
