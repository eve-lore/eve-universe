    Venal** \\- A large battle between Pandemic Legion and the Northern Coalition
    on 30.12.112 resulted in the destruction of an estimated 9 super-capital vessels.
    \  \n  \nSources attributed the recent increase in tension between Pandemic Legion
    and their former allies in the Northern Coalition to the expansion of Pandemic
    Legion's moon-mining operations in Venal, where they hold a number of highly valuable
    Technetium moons.   \n  \nAt least 126 super-capitals (titans and super-carriers)
    are recorded as having been fielded (57 from Pandemic Legion and 69 belonging
    to Northern Coalition alliances and allies) with estimates putting roughly a thousand
    pilots on the field of battle during the four-hour engagement.   \n  \nThe Northern
    Coalition fleet was over twice the size of that fielded by Pandemic Legion and
    received reinforcements as the fight went on, enabling them to inflict rapid and
    heavy damage on the Pandemic Legion super-capital forces, downing six titans and
    one super-carrier while losing only two of their own titans.   \n  \nNorthern
    Coalition forces held the field following the clash with Pandemic Legion, which
    saw over 100 super-capital vessels fielded and 8 titan deaths in Venal.\n\n###
