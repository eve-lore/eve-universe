    live holoreels to the capsuleer community, whilst on the battlefield an impressive
    display by some of the pre-tournament favorites coupled with some strong individual
    performances gave the discerning fight-fan everything they wanted.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t
    a good day to be a destroyer or interdictor pilot, especially flycatchers as they
    suffered heavy losses in a trend that started in the very first match as The Five
    took out Dusk and Dawn. In a contest between two sides that know one another all
    too well, it was The Five that won through .\n\nBand of Brothers, with billions
    of isk riding on their favorites tag, proved themselves capable of mounting a
    defense of their title by whitewashing V 5-0 in a stunning display of firepower.
    \n\nVeritas Immortalis\xB4s destroyer proved to be rather more mortal than the
    name implied and died in eight seconds and his compatriots soon followed. \n\nUshra'Khan
    could only field four players making Mercenary Coalition\xB4s job somewhat easier
    but they still managed to lose a destroyer in their victory. \n\nIndeed with many
    alliances viewing the frigate and destroyer class somewhat expendable and cruisers
    finding themselves primary targets rather quickly, the competition saw a number
    of contests with quick deaths followed by a more tactical approach to bring down
    the bigger guns. \n\nThe first hint of an upset came as Goonswarm started the
    better against Lotka Volterra. However, the stunning tanking ability of LV helped
    them even up the odds and take the victory in a fight that was one for the purists.
    \n\nPrime Orbital Systems bit off more than they could chew against Morsus Mihi
    as a lack of focused fire cost them dear. The correct usage of maintenance drones
    coupled with focus fire decided a large proportion of the day\u2019s action. \n\nSpecifically
    created for the tournament, Red Skull beat the resurrected Fountain Alliance after
    a rule clarification. Despite an early lead for FA, the alliance managed to hold
    onto their Zealot despite taking a pounding and in the end the judges\xB4 ruling
    was in favour of Red Skull with three of their ships standing against FA\xB4s
    lone Fleet Tempest. \n\nFriday\xB4s surprise has to be Truk of The Rock following
    his incredible tanking display in a Tech 1 raven, despite his team losing to Smash
    Alliance. In a time-extended match, Smash\xB4s Caldari Navy Raven and Truk traded
    torpedoes and after ten minutes only a flycatcher had been downed. With a draw
    on the horizon, Smash upped their game and dispatched three ships in quick succession.
    This persuaded the judges to allow the fight to continue but despite a five-on-one
    advantage, including at least six Nosferati, Truk\xB4s raven lasted over ten minutes
    alone, proving the merits of pirate implants! \n\nTo the delight of the Eve TV
    crew, The Coalition of Carebear Killers beat Elecktus Matari and the alliance
    with a naughty acronym proved the vampire Dominix is still a viable tactic. \n\nA
    major corp theft had hindered D-L\xB4s participation in the tournament but they
    maintained their honour by fielding a team against Axiom Empire. \n\nExuro Mortis
    won the day\xB4s cheeky award by inflicting a coup de grace on an FSA Cerberus
    with a snowball and their usage of different types of damage proved too much for
    Free Space Alliance\xB4s tanking capability. \n\nThe tournament\u2019s second
    favorites, Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate, eased to a win over Black Reign
    Syndicate with their focused fire proving too hot to handle and giving them the
    luxury of saving ships for later battles and proving that sentry drones may have
    a difficult time establishing themselves. \n\nThe final match was the third forfeit
    of the day which whilst disappointing, allowed the tournament to finish on time.
    \n\nOverall Caldari ships were highly evident, which mirrors the breakdown of
    the New Eden capsuleer population closely. Given the inability to warp off, torpedo/cruise
    missile spammers do have something of an edge. However, there was enough variety
    of ships on display to dispel the myth that the Navy Raven is unbeatable. Especially
    when we think of Truk\xB4s standard Raven that fought of its enemies for so long,
    which included a Caldary Navy Raven. \n\nFaction battleships, Nosferatu, ECM,
    drones but especially good Fleet Commanders were the main ingredients for Friday\xB4s
    winners and whetted the appetite for more over the forthcoming battles. \n\nWe\u2019ll
    be back Saturday for another comprehensive round-up of the day\xB4s fighting."
