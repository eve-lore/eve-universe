    Providence** \\- Recently, Paxton Federation's sovereign space in Providence has
    come under attack by the region's new inhabitants. According to diplomatic sources,
    fights have been raging since Monday in and around the MH9C-S and AY-29I solar
    systems.   \n  \nPaxton Federation was the only one of the former \"Providence
    Holders\" allied with Curatores Veritatis Alliance which retained sovereignty
    after Against ALL Authorities and its allies conquered the region. The alliance
    was not immediately attacked by the region's newcomers, but hostilities began
    after Paxton Federation ships were claimed to be working with CVA to contest sovereignty
    in AY-24I. Rules set by Against ALL Authorities prohibit contestation of sovereignty
    in the region (a protocol known as a \"Non Invasion Pact\" to which Paxton, as
    CVA allies and enemies of Against ALL Authorities, claim they never agreed).   \n
    \ \n\"[Paxton's capsuleers were] found to be supporting a CVA attack on AY-24I.
    That, along with CVA's clear use of Paxton stations was the spark for renewed
    conflict,\" claimed Ugleb of Ushra'Khan.   \n  \nRandall Alba of Paxton Federation,
    admitted that Curatores Veritatis' vessels are welcome in Paxton's space, however
    he dismissed Ushra'Khan accusations of assisting CVA as false. According to him,
    Curatores Veritatis' Campaign is based in Misaba and reaching Paxton's space would
    require CVA's pilots to fly through enemy lines and, especially, traverse the
    AY-24I system.   \n  \nRandall is convinced that Paxton never broke a pact and
    stated \"We have never signed [anything]... [Ushra'Khan's] claim is based on us
    shooting off-lined structures when our neighbours dropped their sovereignty by
    accident.\"   \n  \nInformation flowing from the region indicates that attacking
    forces comprise of capsuleers from Ushra'Khan, The Star Fraction, Chaos Theory,
    Daisho Syndicate, Solidas XX, Shock An Awe and several other alliances. Reportedly,
    no solar systems have changed hands yet and the damage to structures and vessels
    has yet to be estimated. It is certain, however, that Paxton Federation's forces
    are actually outnumbered and being forced to defend ground.   \n  \nPaxton's Leader,
    Gibguard, explains that his alliance has been fighting for the last four months
    and evaluates the present effort as sustainable. \"We will continue to make Providence
    an uncomfortable place for any unfriendly, wherever they choose to settle,\" he
    stated.   \n  \n\"The Ushra'Khan are committed to seeing the eradication of slaver
    influence in Providence and the removal of their supporters. We have entered a
    new phase of the war and aim to see it finished,\" Ugleb said.\n\n* * *\n\nAre
