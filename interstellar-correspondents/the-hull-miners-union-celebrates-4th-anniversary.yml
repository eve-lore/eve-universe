    Syndicate** \\- 19.2.113 marked the 4th anniversary for the combat-focused corporation,
    The Hull Miners Union [ONION].  \n  \nThe corporation was formed by a small group
    of like-minded pilots who wanted no more than to \"have fun\" and shoot other
    pilots. They started as a pirate corp of five members and were known to roam in
    the Maut system of the Placid region. From those meagre beginnings, ONION has
    become a part of Northern Coalition and is claimed to have more than [38,000 kills
    to their name](http://eve.battleclinic.com/killboard/combat_record.php?type=corp&name=The+Hull+Miners+Union).
    \ \n  \nAccording to former CEO and one of the founding members, Moridin Bashere,
    they joined Chaos Incarnate \"for a bit\" for their first alliance where they
    were focused on \"sov warfare in the drone regions\". They later moved to the
    Syndicate region so they could focus on \"small gang\" warfare. Bashere explained
    why: \"We didn't grow right away and mainly stayed around twenty pilots during
    that time.\"  \n  \nThey went on to create the alliance Gentlemen's Club [STRPR],
    however left after little more than a year, always preferring small gang action,
    something Bashere believes, as he claimed that \"nano fleets\" are their \"specialty\".
    \ \n  \nThey have been unable to find themselves a permanent home it seems, however
    through the years, they have always been able to maintain their core members and
    now average about eighty pilots. When asked how they manage to keep their pilots,
    Bashere explained: \"We are a fun corp. Most corps worry about the ISK coming
    in and what they need to buy with it. Our guys the first thing they ask when they
    log in is are there any gangs going... we concentrate mostly on the [combat].\"\n\n###
