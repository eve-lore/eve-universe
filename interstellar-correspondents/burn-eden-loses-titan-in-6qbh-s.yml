    Stain** \\- The Systematic-Chaos alliance and allies destroyed a BURN EDEN titan
    on Sunday night. Twenty-eight capitals were also lost in the engagement.  \n  \nAccording
    to several reports, [SYS-K] fleet commanders anticipated that two titans belonging
    to BURN EDEN would attempt to ambush their fleet as they jumped into the 6QBH-S
    solar system. Two doomsdays were fired on the inbound stargate but only caught
    eight vessels. [SYS-K] managed to tackle Syrian's titan once heavy interdictors
    arrived at the gate. The second titan piloted by Trinitrous managed to escape.
    \ \n  \nThe Systematic-Chaos fleet engaged the tackled titan while calling for
    reinforcements from the C0VEN alliance, THE KLINGONS [KLING] alliance and the
    Legiunea ROmana [ROMAN] alliance. These three alliances added approximately 140
    pilots to the 120 [SYS-K] had in system already, giving them a large numerical
    advantage over their opponents.  \n  \nBURN EDEN received reinforcements from
    a BricK sQuAD [BR1CK] capital fleet. BR1CK's carriers tried to repair the Erebus
    piloted by Syrian, but the thirteen carriers and thirteen dreadnoughts they brought
    with them could not prevent the destruction of the Erebus. The battle continued
    after the titan destruction as news about the ongoing capital fight spread around
    the Stain region.  \n  \nThe final numbers indicate that [SYS-K] and their allies
    destroyed a total of ten carriers, thirteen dreadnoughts and one titan. [BR1CK]
    and BURN EDEN managed to kill three dreadnoughts and two carriers.\n\n### Galnet
