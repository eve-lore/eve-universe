- body: "Yesterday saw the first round of the [ Alliance Championships](http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=1038&tid=4).
    Organized by the Caldari Gaming Commission, held in an undisclosed system. The
    matches proved to be exiting affairs with sometimes surprising results, stunning
    competitors, onlookers and gamblers alike.   \nThere were five teams who scored
    a flawless victory against their opponents. The first of those was claimed by
    the United Confederation of Corporations against the Distant Star Alliance. The
    second alliance who scored a flawless victory was Band of Brothers, owing much
    to Blacklight in his Navy Raven. Blacklight was the first of many others in this
    round to prove that the Raven is still a mighty ship that should never be underestimated
    when under the hands of an experienced pilot. Another flawless victory was claimed
    by the Five who fought against Freelance Blood Alliance, Five tactics appeared
    to be simply: hit them hard and fast. Prime Orbital Systems showed that drones
    do provide a tactical advantage when they won their fight against the EVE Federation
    Alliance using these tenacious little fighters; without losing any of their main
    ships. The last flawless victory was earned by the Stain Empire who also used
    an abundance of missiles against The Core Collective, in this case a Raven and
    his friends ended up destroying an Apocalypse within seconds. \n\nAside of the
    streams of missiles another tactic we saw often in the first round was tanking.
    Most notable among the tankers was Jade Constantine in a Raven who held her ground
    against Force of Evil's Zealot for a long time. After using up all her cap recharges,
    she was no longer able to continue the tanking and went down fighting. Kunming
    from Kaos Empire showed us that a Deimos can take a fair beating and still remain
    flying to see his team beat Imperium Alliance. This battle saw Kozak of KAOS Empire
    in a Navy issued Megathron fighting the Navy Raven of EternalDark of Imperium
    Alliance. Kunming's Deimos aided Kozak and together they defeated the Raven. Kozak
    was also the only one to use the new armor repairing drones in this Championship.
    \n\nPilots across New Eden were surprised to hear the result of some of the fights,
    Ascendant Frontier won their match against the Pirate Coalition. Ascendant which
    started as a peaceful alliance has seen more combat then they might have wished
    for when G and IRON took an interest in their region. They cannot be considered
    a novice when it comes to fighting any longer, as proven in their first fight
    and victory of the Championship. \n\nMercenary Coalition who was the second favorite
    with the [bookies]( http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=268921\n)
    lost their match against Aegis Militia in a long and intense battle. If you hear
    people talk of the Tempest that just wouldn\u2019t go down they refer to this
    match. Kristie from Aegis Militia piloted a Tempest and in the end of this match,
    when the cruiser and frigate were long gone, she had a long battle against the
    Mercenary Coalition\u2019s Megathron flown by EyeShadow. The Tempest was fitted
    with hardeners and several cap draining modules to steal the energy required to
    maintain her tank just that bit longer than the Megathron\u2019s. It was a very
    close fight and you can find the free holoreels of this match [here](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=267163&page=10#286\n).
    \n\nAnother match that was eagerly awaited by the public was between G Alliance
    and the Imperial Republic of the North. These two alliances are close friends
    of each other and fight along side against Ascendant Frontier and recently Band
    of Brothers. The match was a close call but Imperial Republic of the North won
    in the end and Buddrow of IRON confided in me that they even offered to return
    G\u2019s modules that survived the fight. G showed their good will and assured
    IRON they could safely keep their modules. \n\nChribba wins the admiration of
    all when he entered the arena alone in his Apocalypse. He knew he wouldn\u2019t
    last against three opponents, but he lasted longer than some of other teams which
    consisted of three pilots. Sadly a great number of teams had to forfeit their
    fight because they were engaged otherwise or could not assemble a team of fighters
    on such short notice. Ekliptika did not compete because of an unforeseen loss
    of their battleship earlier that day. Forsaken Empire was late and missed their
    fight. \n\nA detailed list of alliances that advanced to the second round can
    be found [here](http://www.eve-online.com/championship/03.jpg). \n\nWe wish them
    all good luck on the battlefield."
