    Fireworks in Umokka\n\nLast year's event was a hit, with around 250 capsuleers
    from all walks of life in New Eden strutting their stuff in ships equipped with
    fireworks, lasers, snowballs or missiles. Last year's raffle prizes included a
    Thanatos, two PLEX and a Navy Apocalypse, so be on the lookout for surprise prizes.\n\nAs
    usual the pre-show will start at 23:00 UTC on December 31st, and the party will
    continue until at least 01:00 on January 1st. All capsuleers are invited to attend.
    Those who would like to take part in the event are encouraged to come equipped
    with fireworks, lasers, snowballs or missiles to ring in the New Year in style.\n\n
    \n\n###  GalNet References\n\n[New Eden Radio](http://newedenradio.com/) will
    be providing music for the event as well as running the raffle.  \n[Forum Post](https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&m=5346203#post5346203)
