    over 7,000 items in his collection of ships and modules. His goal is to amass
    one of every item available throughout New Eden. His collection includes such
    rare items as a Trinary Data Stream, found on the wreckage of a Jove battleship
    floating in the Stain Region and Luther Veron's Modified Large EMP Smartbomb.
    Entity also collects ships some as rare as the Megathron Federate Issue battleship.\n\nWhat
    started out as a small project to collect items, has turned into an obsession
    that he is passionate about.\n\nEntity explained, \u201CI usually pay fair market
    value for the items I collect and residents of New Eden have been known to donate
    items to me on occasion. Sometimes, I put \"bounties\" on certain items I know
    are rare, which is quite a lot higher than their true value. The largest budget
    I've allocated for a bunch of basic items is 6.5 billion. I don't really remember
    the largest single item reward though, but it's probably in the order of 1 billion.\n\n\u201CI
    used to fund my collection project primarily through trade, both on commodities
    and through the contracts. However, I've since acquired a number of very profitable
    blueprints, and they have been responsible for most of the funding.\u201D\n\nHis
    ship collection includes an Armageddon Imperial Issue, a Raven State Issue, a
    Tempest Tribal Issue, and some Silver Magnates and Guardian Vexors. \u201CThe
    Imperial Armageddon I got off escrow. The Raven State Issue and Tempest Tribal
    Issue were bought from Band of Brothers, who won them in the 3rd Alliance Tournament,\u201D
    Entity told us. He also uses associates to help fill in gaps in his collection,
    by building some of the ships he needs.\n\nEntity stores his ships in freighters,
    separating them according to various races, for example a Caldari Freighter stores
    Caldari ships. This makes it easier for him to track down a certain ship if the
    need arises. Items are also separated in to different containers depending on
    where it came from and what it\u2019s function is. This allows his computers to
    keep up to date inventory.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t started collecting capital ships
    yet, for various reasons, he told us, \u201CI can\u2019t dock them in my headquarters,
    which is located in a high security system. I could buy one of each right now
    if I wanted, but I really prefer everything to be in one station. I may at some
    point have a secondary place to store those, in a low security system, but there's
    no need to hurry.\u201D\n\nEntity has traveled all over New Eden in search of
    items to collect, including the Outer Regions, mainly to collect rare dog tags.
    Sometimes, he finds it difficult to get docking rights to stations, but he always
    manages to get the item. He has been shot at various times throughout his travels,
    however, most find it hard to catch him in his Vagabond. \n\n\u201CI always managed
    to stay out of trouble on runs. However, other people have died while carrying
    items for me, which was rather unfortunate, though luckily the items were not
    irreplaceable,\u201D he remarked.\n\nAs far as competition in New Eden, Entity
    had this to say, \u201CThere used to be a few competitors, but they disappeared
    3 or 4 years ago, which is a shame. There isn't really any other collectors that
    take it to this level, to do business with, unfortunately.\u201D\n\nTwo items
    top his list of things he would like to have in his collection and they are both
    ships, the Apocalypse Imperial Issue and the Opux Luxury Yacht. Citizens owning
    these ships do not usually want to part with them. If they are willing to sell,
    the price is extremely high.\n\nEntity hopes to open a museum in the future, so
    residents of New Eden can view his collection.\n\n* * *\n\n_Internal GalNet References_
