    **Anyed, Genesis** \\- Late last week, over 600 capsuleers from across New Eden
    gathered in Anyed to repel a Sansha incursion but contrary to earlier reports
    of a total victory for capsuleer defenders of the system, Nation completed its
    own objectives, with Sansha commanders in the system uplinking unknown data to
    an unknown source.   \n  \n[![Capsuleers Battle with Sansha Forces in Anyed](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4262/filenamethumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4262/filename.png)DutchGunner,
    a member of Onorata Societa who was in the system during the attempted attack,
    said \"The forces have all been destroyed, including the capital assets that have
    been deployed by Sansha forces.\"   \n  \nThe Sansha have shown in previous attacks,
    however, that their own lives are little valued compared to campaign objectives,
    as illustrated by their common practice of leaving one leader behind in a capital
    ship to safeguard a withdrawal. It has also been shown that their cloning methods,
    or equivalent thereof, are rapid, mobile and highly accurate, enabling a True
    Slave or True Citizen to return fully oriented to the battlefield within minutes
    of their first demise if a vessel can be procured. Many Nation pilots and troopers
    have been quoted as saying, \"There is no death in Nation.\"   \n  \nNetwork captures
    released to the Federation Navy by CONCORD and made public on the twelfth of this
    month suggest that attacks on planets in Anyed, Antem and Imya were purely diversionary
    and further imply that information procured from Nation feeds was deliberately
    misleading, exploiting capsuleers' access to their network.  \n  \nOmune Balenne
    of the Federation Navy says:  \n  \n _\"This is, I believe, a piece of 'intel'
    that the Sansha purposefully crafted in certain ways to mislead us, while still
    relaying information to whatever 'entities' might be out there, at the other end
    of these transmissions. I watched as one of the Nation Commanders, Slave 32152,
    was destroyed. Yet just before the Chimera was torn apart, she transmitted in
    local comms: 'Uplink Established.'  \n  \nThis leads us to believe that Nation
    forces were only vulnerable for certain periods - a theory backed up by the information
    revealed in Node 07. That, outside of a specific window of time, their downfall
    would no longer affect this operation.   \n  \nThis means, then, that the destruction
    of the Nation capital came, so painfully, only seconds too late.\"_  \n  \nSyfa
    of Anshar Incorporated denounced the Nation attack as \"Despicable and deplorable.
    The Sansha rob people of their free will.\"   \n  \nSansha's Nation forces were
    slaughtered at Anyed, but not defeated. The Nation commanders present apparently
    completed their \"assembly\" and transmitted still unknown data through the uplinks
    they established.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Understanding the Sansha Threat](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1426767)
