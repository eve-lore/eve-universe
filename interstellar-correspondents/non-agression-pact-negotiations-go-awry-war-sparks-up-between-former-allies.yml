    at war after negotiations regarding SA\u2019s ceasefire with FIX had taken a turn
    for the worse.\n\nFollowing a non-agression deal made between FIX and SA, Orc
    A, Stain- Alliance diplomat, posted a thread on GalNet today that the terms offered
    to FIX were rejected. The reasons for the hostilities seem complicated. Apparently,
    SA added a clause after the deal between SirMolle and TRIGGER was agreed to by
    all parties. The added clause meant that FIX was to export their belongings with
    regular industrials. Their freighters were to be denied access to the stations
    they intended to clear of assets. This proved to be unacceptable for FIX; according
    to them removing all their assets without the use of freighters would be impossible.
    \n\nDafuzz, BoB director, expressed his concerns in a short interview: \"I was
    informed of several border incursions wherein FIX pilots were sent to the clone
    bay by SA pilots, while it was understood that a deal between SirMolle and TRIGGER
    was in effect. I put out a call to speak to SA, and Orc A responded to my hail.\"
    \n\n\"I was then told that in no uncertain terms would Stain- Alliance cease hostilities
    with FIX Alliance, and that TRIGGER did not have permission or authority to enter
    into negotitations with anyone on SA's behalf. Orc A indicated that he was the
    Stain Alliance Leader, and that he left TRIGGER in charge in his absence, and
    that he was disappointed in TRIGGER's performance while he was away, ostensibly
    because SirMolle and TRIGGER had brokered a deal in the interest of the South
    that didn't include what he wanted. It is quite distressing to note that Evolution's
    long-time friend TRIGGER, CEO of MASS, was apparently overruled by Orc A, who
    was before this date unknown to me.\" \n\nAt this moment in time the reason why
    Stain- Alliance decided to declare war on Band of Brothers remains uncertain.
    Although it is widely assumed that the negotiations regarding FIX and BoBs interference
    will play a part in this. Sadly Orc A was not available for comment and other
    Stain members are not at liberty to talk to reporters. In reaction to these events
    both Ascendant Frontier and the Huzzah federation closed their space to the SA.
    \n\nTribal Souls followed with the following declaration :\"With the announcement
    that Stain- Alliance has war dec'd Band of Brothers. Tribal Souls hereby announces
    plans to immediately set Stain- Alliance to hostile standings. In the interests
    of a stabilized southern area we find this behaviour without notifying any of
    the other corps in the South to be unacceptable.\" \n\nMore news as it becomes
    available."
