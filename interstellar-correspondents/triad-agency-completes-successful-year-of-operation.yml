    a successful year.  \n  \nAccording to Det Resprox, T.R.I.A.D's CEO, the corporation
    has offered 1427 missions in the past twelve months, 124 of those in just the
    last 30 days. In addition, the number of capsuleers using TRIAD's agents has jumped
    by a little over 100.  \n  \nThe corporation has recently joined the Minmatar
    militia and expanded its mission portfolio accordingly. Det Resprox explains that
    T.R.I.A.D's combat agent is now able to offer assignments such as \"kill Amarrian
    pilots, shoot down pirates in Minmatar space or to assassinate someone who deserves
    it.\"[![Det Resprox Takes Off From TRIAD'S HQ](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3286/filenamethumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3286/filename.png)
    \ \n  \nUnfortunately, T.R.I.A.D's agents are not officially licensed and any
    capsuleer completing combat missions from them risks being criminally flagged
    by CONCORD. While Det Resprox is confident that the rewards are well worth the
    risk, not every capsuleer feels the same.  \n  \nKarn Mithralia, a pilot that
    used to fly missions for T.R.I.A.D, is convinced that profitability depends on
    the capsuleer's personal wealth and experience: \"if you were a relatively new
    pod pilot, they [would be] worth it... I found them not so profitable.\"  \n  \nKenny
    Camerman, another capsuleer using T.R.I.A.D's agents, offers his opinion: \"I
    have taken missions to kill pirates and free slaves... i had to go to amarr space
    and shoot [amarrian] haulers at the station, it felt quite thrilling.\"  \n  \nAlthough
    not every capsuleers will be eligible, those interested in this opportunity should
    contact T.R.I.A.D directly at their home system at Teonusude III - Moon 6 - Trust
    Partners Trading Post.\n\n### Interstellar Correspondents Reference:\n\n[T.R.I.A.D
