    in and around the Etherium Reach region between the Red Alliance [RED] (and allies)
    and the \"Ethereal Crossing\" coalition (Ethereal Dawn [ED] and Intrepid Crossing
    [IRC]), the Coalition has announced that they will no longer be defending their
    space. This announcement comes shortly after long time ally and neighbor, Legion
    of XXDeathXX [X.I.X.] reset standing and joined the forces attacking [ED] and
    [IRC].  \n  \nAccording to Ralian Gelain of Best Path Inc. [BPINC], leader of
    the Ethereal Dawn alliance, this \"most difficult decision\" came after \"we started
    seeing more and more numbers come out and turn on us\" adding that \"the combination
    of all the hostilities just started to seem futile, we could continue to hold
    on and be stubborn, but to what end?\"  \n  \nThe current hostilities were sparked
    over an alleged friendly fire incident between [IRC] and LUCKY LEAGUE pilots,
    which in turn, according to Ralian, caused [RED] to \"hot drop carriers on top
    of an ED/IRC gate camp\" and to \"drop five towers in a system where IRC had sovereignty
    in.\" The response to this attack on \"IRC space\", Ralian adds, was to \"take
    the fleet and go siege C-J6MT ([RED]'s home system)\"; a move which prompted a
    response not only from [RED], but all of its friends and allies, who began to
    descend on the so-called \"drone regions\". The injection of new forces (reported
    estimates range anywhere from nine to fifteen alliances) turned the offensive
    by [ED] and [IRC] into a defensive war of attrition.  \n  \nA temporary assist
    by SOLAR FLEET [SOLAR], the arrival of Atlas Alliance [ATLAS], and an abortive
    coup within Red Alliance itself that forced [RED] to return home to defend against
    sovereignty losses gave [ED] and [IRC] some breathing room, but not enough to
    stave off the inevitable evacuation of Etherium Reach.  \n  \nAs to whether or
    not the Ethereal Crossing Coalition will ever return to Etherium Reach, Ralian
    states, \"we made the drone regions our home, the region was named after us, we
    have a certain partiality towards it... we will definitely be around to visit.\"\n\n*
