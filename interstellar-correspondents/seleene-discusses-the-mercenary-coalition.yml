- body: "Almost a year ago a new alliance was started, one that stood out from the
    multitude that existed already. A few days ago I had the pleasure of talking to
    one of it's leading members; Seleene. \n\nThe Mercenary Coalition started with
    two corporations namely Sharks with Frickin' Laser Beams' and 'Body Count Inc'.
    Later more corporations were added such as the 'North Star Networks' and 'the
    Corporation' and even today the Coalition is still expanding. Seleene told me
    that Battle Angels Inc have been asked to join recently but that offer is still
    under discussion with the Angels. \n\nIt is safe to assume that when you see MC
    flying in a group that they are paid to be there. The only exception to that rule
    has been their involvement with the Mordu's Legion. Another exception was made
    for Smash Alliance who earned the attention of the MC because of sloppy communication.
    Now it may sound as if that is nothing to worry about, but the MC are one of the
    leading alliances known as hired guns, an alliance you want to be on good terms
    with obviously. I asked Seleene what makes the MC different from the other mercenary
    corporations and alliances. Seleene: \u201CWhen a client hires the MC, they do
    not get just our pilots and our ships. We try our best to integrate ourselves
    into our client's goals and plans so that we might suggest how to use our capabilities
    most effectively. We pride ourselves on our ability to adapt and overcome almost
    any situation.\u201D \n\nAs of late the MC seems to be more involved in a large
    number of operation judging on the number of appearance on news and on Galnet.
    If you think that mercenaries would prefer to lay low and work in the shadows
    you are clearly mistaken, as Seleene explains that even though they wish to stay
    neutral in alliance politics they can\u2019t afford to sit back and wait until
    they are contacted. It is clear however that when the MC decide to involve themselves
    in affairs, when they are not hired for directly, they do so to make a change
    or to send the message that they deserve to be treated with respect. When the
    Legion ignored the MC they crossed a line with the MC and are now considered to
    be competition instead of friends. Seleene: \u201CAgainst respectable and honorable
    mercenary outfits like KIA Corp, we keep the lines of communication open and do
    our best not to step on each other's feet, so to speak. Against those who fail
    to stay in contact and on friendly terms, we don't rule out anything. This goes
    for other organizations in EVE as well who have chosen to keep a hostile standing
    against the MC.\u201D \n\nAnother example of what the MC is capable of is made
    clear by the story regarding the destroyed outpost owned by the Lacuna Viators.
    Seleene: \u201CLacuna Viators hired the MC to essentially clean out and police
    the Geminate region of space. We did this methodically and successfully with the
    exception of 4S Corp who remained stubbornly entrenched in the stations in FDZ.
    We chose to contain them as best we could and that goal was met with regard to
    their ability to affect our operations in the region. However, our client did
    a less than stellar job of communicating their desires to us, despite repeated
    attempts from the MC for clarification. This led to us being essentially \"let
    go\" two weeks prior to when we expected. Strangely enough, this did not stop
    our client from going forward with plans to deploy an outpost. We were not surprised
    when it was destroyed without our protection\u201D. Seleene is confident that
    the outpost wouldn't have been destroyed if the MC were allowed to finish their
    contract. \n\nIf you are reading this with interest and perhaps even fear there
    is one assuring message that became clear by talking to Seleene, the MC are driven
    by cold hard cash. It seems unlikely they will declare war on a corporations or
    alliance if they are not paid to do so and you treated them with respect. After
    all being a mercenary is just another job and nothing personal."
