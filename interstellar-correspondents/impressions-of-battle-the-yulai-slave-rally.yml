- body: "My ship came out of warp near Yulai 3 with a shudder while explosions flared
    around me. A battle was raging during what was supposed to be a peaceful protest
    against slavery. As I tried to make sense of what I saw, I caught the telltale
    streaks of ships entering warp. I had arrived just as one side of the conflict
    retreated, leaving the field of battle to a PIE fleet, golden Apocalypse and Armageddon
    battleships, along with smaller ships, surrounded by the forlorn shapes of abandoned
    drones, most bearing the tags of well-known anti-slavery groups.   \n  \nAs I
    watched, many of the PIE ships aligned themselves to one of the systems star gates,
    then warped off. I followed, hoping to catch a glimpse of their foes. Once again
    my ship informed me of warp scrambler being used as my ship arrived at the gate.
    By the time my camera drones deployed, however, the gate was occupied again only
    by the forces of PIE. I positioned myself where I could observe to good effect
    and waited while a force of heavy combat craft took up position around the gate,
    streaming smoke rings of distortion indicating sensor boosters at work.   \n  \nIt
    has been said that fleet combat is hours of boredom punctuated by seconds of sheer
    terror. Regardless of the ratio, there is no arguing the fact that most of the
    time spent in a fleet is time spent waiting. This is the side of combat that you
    don't see in holovids. This is the side of combat that you can't really understand
    until you experience it yourself.   \n  \nThe PIE ships waited at the gate, waited
    for an enemy to warp in, waited for those seconds of terror. Every so often a
    ship would warp off to another gate to seek an enemy they could not see. After
    a time the golden ships approached the gate and jumped through, scattering on
    the other side to pursue their foe or return home, I do not know which.   \n  \nReturning
    to the third planet I found a lumbering industrial ship salvaging the remains
    of the battle. With quiet patience it moved among the wreckage taking on anything
    its captain found valuable. Within an hour of the battle even the drones were
    gone."
