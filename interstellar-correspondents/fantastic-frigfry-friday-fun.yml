    Heimatar** \\- A monthly event has been created that sees capsuleers fight each
    other for fun in frigates.   \n  \nThe event, which is also known as \"Frigfry
    Fridays\", will be held on the first friday of each month in the Amamake system.
    Jude Lloyd, event organiser, explains why he has picked frigates to be the chosen
    vessel:  \"I see an under-appreciation for frigates, I love frigate warfare and
    I knew it was simple enough that people might actually participate.\"   \n  \nJude
    confessed to being pleased after the first event that was held last week, saying
    it \"went well\". He also added that as well as \"solo pilots\" turning up there
    were \"even a few gangs\".   \n  \nMrWhitei God, a pilot who was present last
    week, appears to have enjoyed the break from his duties: \"As a Heretic Army member
    we take living in Amamake very seriously. So to take some time off... to battle
    in frigate class ships is a change.\"   \n  \nJude Lloyd concluded that the event
    would continue as long as capsuleer participation remained.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Frigfry
