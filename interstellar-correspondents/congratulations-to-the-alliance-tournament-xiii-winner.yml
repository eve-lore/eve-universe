    With the Alliance Tournament XIII Grand Final having played out and concluded
    last night we would like to congratulate the tournament champions, [Warlords of
    the Deep](https://gate.eveonline.com/Alliance/Warlords%20of%20the%20Deep). After
    being knocked into the elimination bracket by The Camel Empire, they carved their
    way through every team in their path to the finals for a rematch, where they ultimately
    triumphed over their rivals.


    Second place went to [The Camel Empire](https://gate.eveonline.com/Alliance/The%20Camel%20Empire),
    managing to make it all way to the Grand Finals without losing a series, and only
    losing a single match to [Pandemic Legion](https://gate.eveonline.com/Alliance/Pandemic%20Legion),
    who take third place. [Exodus.](https://gate.eveonline.com/Alliance/Exodus._)
    manage to claim fourth place for themselves having also reached the final day
    of the tournament.


    Congratulations to all the winning teams, and thank you to all the teams that
    participated. PLEX and prize ships will be distributed over the coming week (Alliance
    executors, please make sure to check your mail). Prize skins for winning matches
    will be distributed at a later date. [The final bracket results can be seen here
    on the Community website](http://community.eveonline.com/community/alliance-tournament/tournament-brackets/).


    We hope you all enjoyed participating and watching this Alliance Tournament, and
    we look forward to seeing you back to fight in the Amarr Championships later this
    year.'
