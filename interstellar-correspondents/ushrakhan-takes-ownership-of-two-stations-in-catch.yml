    Outpost\", to them. Since that time Ushra'Khan has resided in the Curse region
    marshalling its power for a return to Providence.  \n  \nThe station transfers
    mark a historic moment for the alliance as described by Ugleb, CEO of Sarz'na
    Khumatari [SARZ] in a speech to the alliance. He says in part, \"It has been over
    two years since the fall of Unity Station, the events of that battle took their
    toll upon us, and it took a long time, indeed, for us to recover from it\" adding
    further that \"for two years we have worked towards this day, and at last we arrive.
    We stand now stronger than ever before.\"  \n  \nIt should be noted that the stations,
    one of which is in V2-VC2, the other in 5-N2EY, lay within easy striking distance
    of [CVA] assets.\n\n#### GalNet References\n\n[History of Ushra'Khan](http://wiki.eveonline.com/wiki/Ushra'Khan_\\(Player_alliance\\))\n\n*
