    of possibly the most confusing of factions, The Sani Sabik. \n\nWhat makes a Blood
    Raider a Blood Raider. What\u2019s the difference between a Blood Raider and a
    Sani Sabik? So how do you know if you\u2019re a Sani Sabik in the making or if
    you\u2019re off on completely the wrong foot? This reporter strapped on her rubber
    apron and went looking for the answers from someone who knows: Mebrithiel Ju\u2019wien.\n\nMs
    Ju\u2019wien described herself as not exactly a teacher of the Sani Sabik, but
    as someone who is respected among many sects for her depth of research and strength
    of will. This latter appears to be a very important quality in a Sani Sabik. The
    young Sebiestor explained:\n\n\u201CSani Sabik has many core principles, to be
    honest. Firstly there's the divinity of will, or to break it down, the idea that
    the strong of will and person should lead the rest. What this comes down to is
    usually a hierarchical structure not unlike the Amarr Empire, but with the right
    people in the right places.\n\n\u201CSecondly, there's the search for eternal
    life. This is an old difference that, from my research in ancient texts is probably
    one of the sole principles that separated Sani Sabik from the original Amarr faith.\n\n\u201CFinally,
    Sani Sabik believes in the strength of blood - a biological indicator that ties
    in both the previous principles and is espoused in various formats throughout
    each cult. The Blood Raider Covenant, Omir's lot, take the more literal path,
    one Cyshade follows quite closely, as do I. Then there's the strength blood has
    on your destiny and ability, a route I believe Miss Neferis takes to heart.\u201D\n\nThese,
    then, are the points of commonality between the Sects\u2026 But what qualities
    do they look for in a member? Miss Ju\u2019wien had this to say:\n\n\u201CBeing
    a pod-pilot is almost deity. We have immortality in our reaches and the control
    of the stars, but every pilot does.\n\n\u201CIn Sani Sabik, your force of will
    is the big decider. You'll find the older Sani Sabik and Blood Raider loyalists
    tend to be prominent figures throughout the pilot community...they also tend to
    be the more vocal, although some of us prefer to not draw attention unless it's
    desired, like Cyshade.\u201D\n\n\u201CMy first experience in Sani Sabik was with
    Blood Inquisition. Before that, I was just another girl in space.\u201D\n\nMebrithiel
    herself started out flying in the Glamour Bunnies, an entertainment corporation,
    but something that is a commonplace experience for many pilots, was a life-shaping
    moment for her.\n\n\u201CI think it was getting shot down in lowsec by a few pirates
    that flicked a switch in me. Instead of ranting and raving, I recognized the dominance
    of these killers and decided it was a path I would take.\n\n\u201CI researched
    various factions and pirate groups and found that the Bleak Lands and the native
    Blood Raiders appealed to my tastes.\n\n\u201CI met Hira'razhir and Gogo Yubari
    and they kind of raised me to [be a] pirate. I guess that's when I began my faith
    in earnest.\u201D\n\nAnd here we get to the key of it \u2013 the way faith (or
    philosophy for some) shapes the daily life of a Sani Sabik. For there is more
    to it than dusty tomes and a lot of plastic sheeting, and it involves every pilot\u2019s
    second favourite thing: guns.\n\n\u201CThe best answer to that would be asking
    my corpmates and friends about my doll house, but put simply, I'm a killer and
    I preach my faith through my guns. I don't mind ransoming, as it's my corporation\u2019s
    operation style, but if they don't pay for the pod, their corpse is mine.\u201D\n\nMebrithiel
    goes to some pains to assure me that she is not, however, some sort of corpse-molesting
    deviant.\n\n\u201CI have almost complete dibs on the corpses we expose through
    our work, but my use is completely innocent:\n\n\u201CI drain the corpses of the
    blood for ritual purpose and then I keep them... as dolls. I guess I'm more hands
    on with my rituals. I do them myself for me and my followers. I use my ritual
    practices to enforce my position among my followers and to keep them fanatically
    devoted, as they should be.\u201D\n\nEven knowing about the hierarchical nature
    of the Sani Sabik, finding out that Mebrithiel has followers came as something
    of a surprise, as she flies for [Veto](http://www.eve-online.com/alliances/a_822746991.asp),
    a Guristas-affiliated corporation. I pressed her on this, and she said:\n\n\u201CThe
    Guristas are an unusual lot. While the Blood Raiders are friendly with them, I
    believe, although Omir would have to back me up on this, that it's a survival
    pact more than anything. \n\n\u201CWhile the Serpentis and Angels have business
    relations, the other three main pirate empires are alone in practice. The Nation
    is a wildcard, but seem to get along with the Guristas through what each like
    and dislike - they dislike everyone. But the Covenant have no desire to work with
    anyone and most of their prominent figures perhaps even dislike the Nation and
    Guristas because of their lack of faith or sheer weirdness.\n\n\u201CI'm a little
    more practical and find my friends to often be of such ideological alignment as
    the Nation and Guristas. Veto Corp support the Guristas and Izzychan's Naqam are
    our friends and a strong supporter of the Nation, if not an actual voice of Sansha,
    if you believe the rumours. \n\n\u201CI do however have fellow 'blooders' among
    Veto's ranks, with Leon026 being my favoured. That man kills like it's an art
    form and practices the more diplomatically astute form of Sani Sabik - you could
    speak with him, if he's not busy killing something, another time perhaps...\n\n\u201C...and
    he still owes me a date.\u201D\n\nSo there we have it. Being a Sani Sabik isn\u2019t
    about who you fight, and isn\u2019t about who you fly with.\n\nIt\u2019s about
    being who you are. And being that person just as hard as you can.\n\nWith guns.\n\nForever."
