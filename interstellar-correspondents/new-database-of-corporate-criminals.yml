    ISK in blueprints and cash to a corporate thief. The perpetrator was a trusted
    ally for five months before the crime took place. Unlike many corporations, which
    would rather not reveal that they have been robbed, VonHeise decided to do something
    about the problem; he created a [database](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=603530)
    on Galnet of those accused of stealing from their corporations. \n\nThe database
    contains a notice that not everyone in it is necessarily guilty. \u201CAll I do,\u201D
    VonHeise said, \u201Cis put the information out there with both parties saying
    from their perspective what happened and then I let those who read it make the
    determination as to who they are going to believe. If I get someone coming to
    me and complaining about the actual information I make a \u201Cdisputed\u201D
    entry and let people read that as well.\u201D \n\nThe database contains thefts
    ranging from 20 million ISK to 700 billion ISK (from the infamous EIB scam). When
    asked about his inclusion of some of the smaller thefts VonHeise said, \u201CIf
    someone takes a small amount they have shown they cannot be trusted\u2026If you
    can\u2019t be trusted with small amounts you can\u2019t be trusted with larger
    ones either.\u201D \n\nVonHeise is quick to point out that this is an individual
    effort and not one by either his corporation or his alliance. \u201CIf it came
    down to it I would leave my corporation if they wanted it that way and continue
    with the list. I want all other corporations to have this information so they
    can make informed decisions about who they are bringing into their corporations,\u201D
    he said. \n\nThe database will not only be of interest to corporations\u2014bounty
    hunters can collect ISK because several of the corporations in the database have
    placed bounties on their thieves. VonHeise thinks this has helped to slow down
    thefts. \u201CIt will help people think twice about stealing. If someone gets
    tempted\u2026they will know they will be hunted.\u201D \n\nEven pirate corporations
    are not immune from corporate thefts. Katie Door, CEO of The United, reported
    recently that two corporation members had stolen 2.5 billion in ships and equipment
    from their corporate hanger. \u201CThese two individuals,\u201D she said, \u201Cshould
    not be trusted under any circumstance and should be rejected by any corporation
    that values honesty and integrity in its pilots.\u201D The United has placed a
    100 million ISK bounty on the offenders. \n\nCorporation security stands on two
    legs. First, corporations limit access to their most valuable assets. In so doing
    they must walk a fine line between this limitation and making sure their assets
    are available to benefit their corporations. Second, corporations only allow members
    of long standing to access their assets. This, however, is not a guarantee. As
    the VonHeise case proves, even a relationship of five months may still hide a
    criminal from view. \n\nNow corporations have one more tool to combat thefts\u2014the
    VonHeise database. Through it corporations can check their new applicants against
    the database to see if they have been involved in shady dealings in the past."
