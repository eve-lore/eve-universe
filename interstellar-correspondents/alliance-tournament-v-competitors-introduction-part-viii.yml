- body: "The **Fifth Alliance Tournament** is almost upon us. This year\u2019s entrants
    include a number of new, smaller and mostly unknown alliances as well as the established
    tournament veterans. \n\nNext in our series of Alliance introductions, we present
    _**The Fourth District** and **Notoriety Alliance**_. \n\n**The Fourth District**\n\n*
    * *\n\nFounded late last year, The Fourth District is comprised of four corporations
    and 130 members. Svetlana Scarlet, a Chief Diplomat of the alliance tells us that
    \u201Cthe formation of The Fourth District was the culmination of six months of
    effort to build a Caldari loyalist alliance that has a stronger paramilitary focus
    than any of the previous attempts at doing so.\u201D The Fourth operates out of
    Mordu\u2019s Legion space in Pure Blind with the primary goal of keeping Triumvirate
    and Atrum Tempestas Foedus at bay in the region. \n\nThe Fourth District is one
    of a scant few alliances that have entered the tournament for the pride of State,
    rather than personal gain. Ladel Teravada, Deputy Chief of Fleet Operations explains:
    \u201CWe feel the need to make sure the State is represented in the tournament\u2026we
    do what we do because it needs to be done, not for fame or fortune\u201D. Svetlana
    adds: \u201CWe are always interested in bringing more light to the State\u2019s
    cause\u201D. \n\n**Notoriety Alliance**\n\n* * *\n\nFounded almost five months
    ago, Notoriety was formed out of nine corporations and approximately 238 members.
    Mes Rens, Executor of the alliance, tells us that Notoriety specializes in small
    gang combat and resides in the southern Syndicate region. With a firm grasp on
    the TA-A7V constellation, Mes and his alliance also help control the MK7-A0 and
    JQV5-9 constellations (although Notoriety holds no sovereignty in the region,
    they actively patrol the area and have claimed it for themselves). \n\nWith the
    ban on expensive officer modules and pirate implants, Mes feels that this year\u2019s
    tournament rules levels the playing field between larger alliances with deep pockets
    and smaller alliances with scant resources. In Mes\u2019 opinion, the fame of
    winning the tournament may help fuel expansion plans in the Syndicate region and
    beyond. Notoriety's daily regimen of small gang operations in Syndicate may give
    them an edge in the tournament this year. \n\n* * *\n\n_More coverage will be
    available live during the tournament. The Fourth District will be engaging Exa
    Nation on Day One of the tournament. Notoriety Alliance will face SMASH Alliance
    on Day 2._"
