    Derelik** \\- On 27.04.113, capsuleer Kazzzi of Heathen Legion announced the winner
    of the Heathen Achievement Award as Bahamut420.   \n  \nThe competition received
    attention from Minmatar loyalists, especially followers of winner Bahamut420,
    who has since been stressing his efforts and achievements against the Amarr. Hans
    Jagerblitzen of Autocannons Anonymous explained: \"No Minmatar warrior has spent
    more time covered in blood, sweat, and pod-goo than Bahamut420. He without a doubt
    deserves this award.\"   \n  \nIn an interview, Bahamut stated that although he
    didn't send in an entry himself, he was \"honoured\" to see so many of his friends
    and war targets voted for him and believes that the Heathen Achievement Award
    shows their enemies that they will \"work together to defeat them\".   \n  \nHe
    has received his prize, a Revelation class dreadnought and already jumped it into
    the warzone. He said: \"All of my ships are used for battle. The Revelation will
    destroy things with fire.\" Lastly, he also mentioned that he would like to thank
    Kazzzi and Ushra'Khan for the \"lovely\" gift.   \n  \nCapsuleer Vaari, an amarr
    loyalist who came in second, did not even know his name had been mentioned as
    a potential winner until he was contacted for an interview and made it clear that
    he had rejected the prize.   \n  \nHe also dismissed the initial purpose of the
    contest as heresy and explained that Kazzzi was merely attempting to divide the
    ranks of the \"loyal Amarr even more than they are today\". He went on to also
    say that Kazzzi had failed.   \n  \nIn closing, Vaari said: \"Altough our loyalist
    ranks are a little divided, our Empire is a whole, and her majesty will keep our
    people safe. Whatever these abominations will do, it will fail. Every amarr loyalist
    will gladly give their lives to counter those hexers' threat.\"   \n  \nKazzzi
    explained what the competition was about: \"This contest was no place for modesty.
    I wanted to hear bold statements backed up by heroic actions.\"   \n  \nKazzzi
    states that, in his opinion, Bahamut420 is one of the greatest enemies of the
    empire and that they made the right decision when choosing him as the winner.
    He also mentioned a new contest would \"absolutely\" be held again next year,
    if not sooner.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Heathen Achievement Award Winners
