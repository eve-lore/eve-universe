    Geminate** \\- On 20.2.113, Northern Coalition forces were successful in placing
    Solar Fleet station, 'O4 SOLAR CITADEL', into reinforced mode.  \n  \n[![](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4408/stationo4solarcitadellocatedwithinsystemo4-lqminreinforcedmodeimagethumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F4408%2Fstationo4solarcitadellocatedwithinsystemo4-lqminreinforcedmodeimage.png)Northern
    Coalition forces, who were returning to mount a 2nd attack on the station, experienced
    no intervention from hostile forces in O4-LQM. However a hostile fleet of 800
    capsuleers comprised primarily of Solar Fleet, Legion of xXDEATHXx, and White
    Noise (DRF) were present in the neighbouring solar system of Y8R-XZ. Once 'O4
    SOLAR CITADEL' was placed into reinforced mode, Northern Coalition forces began
    to travel home.  \n  \nCapsuleer, Chung Mu, from -MOSTLY HARMLESS- (NC), said
    of the operation: \"NC had several fleets up, armour fleet, shield alpha strike
    fleet, BC fleet, I was a logistics pilot in the shield fleet. We around 700-800
    [Pilots] and we heard that the [DRF] had around the same ready to hot drop.\"
    \ \n  \nThe Northern Coalition forces were then ambushed by Solar Fleet and their
    allies while travelling home through solar system VSJ-PP, as Chung Mu continues,
    \"[DRF] hot dropped an Abaddon fleet on my fleet which was moving last when it
    came to the fight. They cyno'd in around 20 -30 carriers to rep their Abaddons,
    after half an hour, to an hour, [they] started to jump out.\u201D  \n  \n[![](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4408/ncforcesinvsj-ppleavingsystemafterbattleimagethumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F4408%2Fncforcesinvsj-ppleavingsystemafterbattleimage.png)Ji'txi
    Mu'rah of Morsus Mihi (NC) was also present in the battle and described the events:
    \u201C[They] jumped in carriers which were nearly all obliterated, NC then picked
    off stragglers... got some free kills.\u201D  \n  \nJunior SvK, a Fleet Commander
    from R.A.G.E (NC) told his version of events: \u201CWe were ambushed by DRF forces
    that attacked on our fleet with carriers, we regrouped and counter engaged them.
    DRF, after our counter attack had to pull back and leave the field.\u201D  \n
    \ \nTensions are high between NC and DRF forces as violence in Geminate continues.
    A total of 370 Ships including several capsules were lost during the engagement.
    \ \n  \nDRF forces were unavailable for comment on their ambush of Northern Coalition
    forces in VSJ-PP.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Supercapitals clash in Uemon](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=4402&tid=7)
