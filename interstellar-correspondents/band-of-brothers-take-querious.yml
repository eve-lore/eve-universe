- body: "QUERIOUS. The Band of Brothers Alliance added a new region to its assets
    last week, storming Querious in full force and eventually capturing the region
    despite heavy resistance from a large coalition of alliances. They are now claiming
    the war for Querious as over, and the region as BoB sovereign territory.\n\nThe
    lead up to these events stems back many months. For several of the coalition alliances,
    the aim originally was to remove Firmus Ixion, who had long inhabited the region.
    \u201CWe have not gotten along well with FIX for a long while,\u201D explained
    Gloria Khan of the Stain Alliance, speaking of longstanding disputes over access
    routes to Empire space. \u201CThey were the original target, that simple,\u201D
    stated XirtamVotf, leader of the Imperium Alliance and the makeshift coalition.
    \u201CBoB came, then the coalition as it were, decided to fight and test their
    mettle.\u201D \n\nWhat ensued were three fiercely contested battles in the 9CG6-H
    system, where the FIX Alliance held its last station, having already lost control
    of three others in 3BK-07, H74-B0, and FAT-6P over previous months. \u201CBy the
    time the battle for 9CG started, it was apparent that we were unable to mass sufficient
    capital ships\u2026to fend off a deliberate assault,\u201D stated Valhallan, speaking
    on behalf of Firmus Ixion. \u201CFIX leadership has long surmised that the imminent
    fall of 9CG would be the trigger for BOB to get involved,\u201D he continued.
    \u201CSeeing a growing threat to their home systems, BoB moved quickly to stabilize
    the system\u2026and reclaimed 9CG in a series of decisive fleet engagements.\u201D\n\n\u201CAfter
    we saw them all assembled in one system, it was way too good to resist,\u201D
    commented Shrike, speaking on behalf of BoB about the gathering of the unofficial
    coalition, which included the Imperium Alliance, the Fountain Alliance, Vox Imperium,
    Vertigo Coalition, the Smash Alliance, the Stain Alliance and the Huzzah Federation.
    \u201CWe sent down approximately half of BoB to mess around\u2026but on Sunday
    we decided to send it all down. This is 3 days after, 9CG has fallen to us, and
    H74 has fallen to us\u2026it's over, totally.\u201D\n\nReflecting on the battles,
    coalition members conceded that the entry of the Band of Brothers was a defining
    moment in the war. \u201CWhen BoB showed up the tables turned against us and our
    brothers in arms,\u201D said Matrixx of Vox Imperium. However, common amongst
    all coalition alliances was a sense of pride that they had taken the battle to
    BoB and provided the beginnings of what may come to be a consistently fierce and
    organized anti-BoB force. \n\n\u201CI am proud of what we did, we gave them a
    nosebleed for the first few days,\u201D said Koth Fluf of Vertigo Coalition. \u201CI
    think the operation was a success in that respect.\u201D His sentiments were shared
    by all of the coalition alliances. Hans Roaming of the Huzzah Federation reiterated
    the upbeat feeling, \u201CIt was a trial by fire and our guys showed they had
    it.\u201D The Band of Brothers sees things differently however, with Shrike stating,
    \u201CThe only thing we mourn out of all this, is that seven alliances broke so
    fast.\u201D \n\nFor the time being, though, spirits remain defiant within the
    Coalition and whether the Coalition is truly broken remains to be seen. One thing
    is clear though, according to Valhallan, the alliance Firmus Ixion... \"unshackled
    from the chains of territorial defense requirements\", will be an entirely different
    animal."
