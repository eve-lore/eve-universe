    Tribute** \\- It appears that Morsus Mihi [RAWR] is currently undergoing drastic
    internal restructuring, with long-term alliance leader, Vuk Lau, facing calls
    for new leadership for the alliance's \"lack of direction.\"   \n  \nMorsus Mihi,
    once a cornerstone alliance of the Northern Coalition, saw its territory much
    reduced and the coalition effectively eradicated by a sustained assault from the
    so-named \"Drone Region Forces\" earlier this year. Previous statements from Morsus
    Mihi's leadership have confirmed that the alliance will be moving to the Blood
    Raider territories in Delve and turning to a pure combat focus in the future.
    A source within the alliance claimed that the industrial corporations within the
    alliance are \u201Creally not happy with the direction\" they are taking.   \n
    \ \nImperian, a leading FC in Morsus Mihi has said that FCs are now taking the
    lead role in the alliance leadership: \u201CVuk Lau stepped back and I am giving
    out the direction the alliance will go, together with a few other military personnel...
    I'd call it trimming the fat.\u201D[![Extract from internal communique](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4609/extractfrominternalcommuniquthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4609/extractfrominternalcommuniqu.png)
    \  \n  \nA communiqu\xE9, allegedly leaked from Morsus Mihi's internal communications
    network, includes questions from alliance members asking if they can \"vote for
    a new more active leadership?\u201D Vuk Lau responded: \u201CNo, but yeah RAWR
    will be lead in upcoming months by FCs with Imperian on the helm.\u201D The internal
    communiqu\xE9 appearS to confirm the claims from the source within RAWR.[![Extract
    from internal communique #2](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4609/extractfrominternalcommuniqu2thumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4609/extractfrominternalcommuniqu2.png)

    \  \n  \nVuk Lau denied any knowledge of the internal communiqu\xE9. He did, however,
    go on to confirm that RAWR will not be assisting Razor Alliance in any evacuation
    or defence operations and also that upon relocation to Delve, RAWR may consider
    engaging in hostile combat with Test Alliance Please Ignore.   \n  \nNeterti Axexut,
    diplomat for Drone Region Forces [DRF], recited their opinion of RAWR based on
    their own intelligence: \u201CFrom what we have heard, there are a number of problems
    within leadership now - from residual issues about the prosecution of the last
    war to plans for their future.   \n  \n\u201CThere was the Morsus Mihi leadership
    of old which were top notch and very focused. Then, due to a number of reasons,
    that leadership and natural aging, that leadership proved much less effective
    and their focus changed away from the things that made them effective earlier.\u201D
    \  \n  \nAs this article went to press, Imperian had left RAWR and joined Pandemic
    Legion, another indication that the alliance may be suffering with internal leadership
    problems.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Morsus Mihi - Evelopedia Entry](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Morsus_Mihi)
