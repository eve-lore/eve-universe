    fleets to defend several control towers that had been put into reinforced mode
    by NCDOT, with NCDOT fielding a heavily-plated Abbadon-focused fleet.   \n  \nNCDOT's
    commander, Vince Draken, relied on a system of warp disruptor bubbles and timing
    to slow Northern Coalition reinforcements and divide their fleets.   \n  \nWhile
    the NC fleet received reinforcements throughout the fight, NCDOT forces reshipped
    repeatedly, maintaining a solid presence on the field, and eventually managed
    to destroy a Technetium-mining tower that had exited reinforced mode in culmination
    of a battle that lasted more than two hours.   \n  \nAccording to one NC informant,
    their fleet became embroiled in two seperate, simultaneous engagements in the
    system. He described the situation as chaotic at that point and stated that, in
    his view, they had no clear orders. Official representatives of the Northern Coalition,
    however, were contacted but declined to comment.   \n  \nFighting has continued
    in R6XN-9 over the last two days, with NCDOT control towers coming under assault
    in Northern Coalition counter-attacks. \n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Merciless.
