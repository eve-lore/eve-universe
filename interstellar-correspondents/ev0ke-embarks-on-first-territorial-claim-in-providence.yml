    early hours of this morning, Ev0ke launched a final assault on the JEIV-E system
    with supercapitals and over a hundred battleships. The defence fleet formed by
    the Providence Block could not stop them from seizing the station and forcing

    took several tries before the reinforcement timers could be synchronized, optimizing
    Ev0ke's chances of a successful operation. \"Since both IHUB and station in JEIV
    had their final timer within an hour, we did concentrate on those\" said Pagefault,
    Ev0ke's diplomat.  \n  \nTo begin the assault, Ev0ke assembled an approximately
    160 man battleship fleet and started to harrass the Providence Block's defence
    fleet of about 180 battlecruisers. Most of the encounters occurred near Ev0ke's
    deployed Sovereignty Blockade Units.  \n  \nWhile the smaller ships were engaged,
    Ev0ke's 8 fielded supercapitals destroyed the system's IHUB, followed by the seizure
    of the station which came out of reinforcement shortly after. The operation was
    a success, leaving JEIV-E sovereignty open for Ev0ke.  \n  \nEv0ke's offensive
    is not over as they have stated plans to take over more systems.  \n  \nRequests
    for a statement from Sodalitas XX remain unanswered at this time.\n\n* * *\n\nAre
