    **Inoue, The Citadel** \\- Last Thursday, capsuleer Holiday Spirit held his 6th
    Holiday Spirit event, giving out presents and getting the attending capsuleers
    into a festive mood.  \n  \nHours before the location was officially announced,
    Spirit gave out a hint and it was soon believed that the event would be taking
    place in Inoue. Following that discovery, capsuleers started moving in from all
    over New Eden gathering in empire space to celebrate Christmas.  \n  \nWhen Holiday
    Spirit finally arrived, there was much cheering. Capsuleer numbers in Inoue climbed
    up to around 1100 and the local communication channel was overwhelmed with activity.
    \ \n  \nAmidst the joyful mood, organiser Holiday Spirit was very busy giving
    out his presents and noted that; \"last year [there were] around 450 at the peak..
    this is nuts\". Gifts ranged from frigates to command ships and capsuleer Forbes1,
    who received an Executioner as his gift was \"glad people offered to do these
    Special Events.\"  \n  \nMiss Holly, who was also attending, was very happy with
    the event, although slightly upset with the disruptive behaviour of some in the
    local channel.  \n  \nBoth are planning to attend next year's event as well. Miss
    Holly's personal message to the organiser: \"roll on next year and thanks for
    the gift.\"  \n  \nHoliday Spirit was unavailable at this time for comment.\n\n*
