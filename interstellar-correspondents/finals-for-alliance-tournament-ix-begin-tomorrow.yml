    Stages for the Ninth Alliance Tournament are complete and the first rounds of
    the Finals are set for tomorrow.  \n  \nNo flagships were fielded today, but several
    large ISK offers to throw matches kept things interesting.  \n  \nWith some group
    leaders already in such dominant positions, several matches had no effect on position
    in the finals. This also applied to lower ranking participants who saw no need
    to put in much effort as they were already out of the finals based on points;
    the last match of the day included a conga line of two teams who were already
    effectively out of the tournament.  \n  \nBrackets for the Finals are set up and
    the action will resume tomorrow. Clicking on our \"Rankings\" tab will take you
    to the brackets where you can easily find who your favorite team will be fighting
    tomorrow.   \n  \nMatch reports and statistics are available on the Interstellar
    Correspondents' website.  \n  \nCome visit us at:\n\n## <http://at.eve-ic.net/>\n\n*
