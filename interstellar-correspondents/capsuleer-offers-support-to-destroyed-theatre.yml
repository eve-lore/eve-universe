    month as part of a protest by the Minmatar right-wing organisation Free our Families
    [FOF].  \n  \nFOF members had claimed responsibility for destroying the stage
    as a reaction to the continued showing of the controversial play 'Plantation'.
    The Scope also reported that the theatre's [director had faced death threats](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=4069&tid=4)
    over the production.  \n  \nBorgholio offered to donate \"as much ISK as needed\"
    to aid in any reconstruction efforts as well as placing high bounties on the heads
    of the culprits. He also stated that he hopes that \"by actually stepping forward
    and doing something\", he could \"encourage others to do the same.\"  \n  \nElsebeth
    Rhiannon, CEO of Gradient and council member of Electus Matari commented on the
    matter, stating the she was \"glad to hear about this effort to reconstruct the
    theatre\" and while \"uncertain whether rebuilding MPT alone will as such help
    turn anyone's back on the hatred\", she deems it \"a symbol that we, as a people,
    will not be quieted by threats of violence and destruction.\"  \n  \nRodj Blake,
    an Amarr capsuleer also responded: \"Many people were horrified at the ferocity
    of attacks on the MPT. The destruction of their theatre merely demonstrates that
    although many Minmatars claim to be in favour of free speech, in reality they
    are not.\" Whilst looking \"forward to the day that the MPT can once again perform
    their production of Plantation\", he also fears that any support offered to the
    MPT would \"no doubt be used as an excuse by the violent barbarians who oppose
    them to launch another attack.\".  \n  \nThere has been no official word on the
    status of the theatre, nor of any efforts to rebuild.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected
