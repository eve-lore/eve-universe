    **Oruse, Solitude** \\- Sansha 's Nation began an invasion of Oruse at approximately
    22:00 last night, as predicted by hidden messages, apparently independently discovered
    by Arklan1 of Dunedan Rangers and Culmen of Blood Phage Syndicate in Nation network
    transmissions that have now been verified and deciphered by multiple independent
    capsuleers.   \n  \n[![Sansha Fleet in Oruse](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4251/sanshafleetthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4251/sanshafleetthumb.png)Prior
    to the attack, Eleutherian Guard pilot Seriphyn Inhonores and Anslo of First Flying
    Wing Inc claim to have attempted an evacuation of Oruse II, but the Archon carrier,
    _The Ifrit_ , was destroyed by Rote Kapelle forces.   \n  \nMany capsuleers, including
    those from the corporation The Revenent Defence Corporation [R.D.C], entered the
    system in a bid to push back the invading forces from Sansha's Nation but as of
    midnight last night, pilots were facing strong opposition and Nation reinforcements
    were coming thick and fast.   \n  \nBoth sides sustained heavy losses, but Sansha's
    Nation were holding their own and dominating the area around Oruse II.   \n  \nThe
    True Citizen leading the assault, Citizen Astur, claimed to have successfully
    \"uplifted\" a significant portion of the planet's population some time before
    a heavy Pandemic Legion fleet entered the system and engaged and destroyed the
    majority of the Sansha forces, including Astur's own Wyvern super-carrier, though
    an alleged third-party report published by Pandemic Legion pilot Elize Randolph
    today claims that the population were saved. There has so far been no statement
    by planetary authorities to verify the claims of either side.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Interstellar
