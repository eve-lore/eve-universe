- body: "Anarchy reigns in the militia communication channels. No one knows what fleets
    are active, what they are doing, or who is commanding them. Within days of the
    formation of their militia, the Caldari had an effective organization. One Gallente
    pilot is trying to bring the same form of order to the Federal Defence Union.
    \n\nAegis Commander Remy Valios of Strix Armaments and Defence has been actively
    seeking corporate CEOs and Fleet Commanders to work with him in establishing a
    general council. While the council is not intended to control the actions of the
    militia, it is hoped that it will allow Fleet Commanders and corporations to work
    in conjunction with other active fleets and allies from the Tribal Liberation
    Force. There is no singular head to this council, as Valios has intended it to
    be run as a democratic gathering, in the true spirit of our Gallente forebears.
    \n\nThe fledgling council is off to a good start as several CEOs and Fleet Commanders
    have already joined the private communications channels."
