    The Citadel** \\- Capsuleers will have the chance to put their reaction capabilities
    to the test in the fourth season of the subwarp frigate race starting tomorrow.
    \ \n  \nThe first out of the five races of the season will take place this Saturday.
    Unlike previous races run through multiple systems to designated markers, subwarp
    racing requires a much more direct control of the vessel by the capsuleer to avoid
    the obstacles laid out as part of the course. The organizer, Julius Rigel, explained
    why capsuleers are drawn to the event: \"Our events aim to challenge a [capsuleer's]
    reflexes and experience rather than the skillbooks and implants he has installed.
    We provide an opportunity for every capsuleer, new or old, to meet and compete
    in a fun and exciting environment.\"  \n  \nThe entrance fee is 10 million ISK
    for all five races. The winner of each race will recieve 50 million ISK. Twenty
    million ISK and 5 million ISK are awarded for second and third place finishes
    respectively.  \n  \nThe event will be broadcast [live](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1344532&page=1#11)
    on Saturday at 18:00, and Julius hopes that a commentary team can be put together
    by then.  \n  \nJulius revealed that in the past these events have not always
    gone smoothly: \"A few aggressions were made during the all-day Impulse Con 112
    earlier this year, and we have had a case of a racer attempting to engage an opponent
    while racing, but all instances were swiftly dealt with by CONCORD forces and
    no major losses were incurred.\"  \n  \nWhen asked how far he could take the event
    in the future, Julius said: \"I will take this venture all the way or die trying...
    Someone has to step up and provide a real, wholesome activity for everyone to
    take part in, and I am here to lay the foundation, to set the precedent, to prove
    that it can be done.\"\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Latest Announcement](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1344532)
