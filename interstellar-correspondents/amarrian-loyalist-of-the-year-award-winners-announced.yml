    the pilots who have done the most for the Empire this past year.   These pilots
    were selected by their peers, as examples of the selfless dedication and devotion
    to God, Empress, and Empire that is the core of all good Amarrians. The names
    of the nominees were passed to the members of PIE Inc., who then voted for the
    capsuleer of their choice.\n\nPIE Inc. CEO, **Admiral Rodj Blake** , was on hand
    for the inaugural event to deliver background information on each recipient before
    announcing their names.\n\nThe first award announced, the one of Loyal Servant
    of the Year, was awarded to a non-Amarrian pilot who was recognized for his efforts
    on behalf of the Empire.   This award went to **Nephilim Xeno** , who Admiral
    Blake described as, \"...an exceptional pilot who has demonstrated a willingness
    to work for the Empire with regard only for the objective at hand.\"  Xeno is
    a testament to the fact that hard work and dedication to the Empire will be rewarded,
    regardless of ancestry.  \n\nThe second award, Amarrian Capsuleer of the Year,
    was to be awarded to an Amarrian, Khanid, or Ni-Kunni pilot whose efforts had
    been recognized as instrumental to the advancement of the Empire.  This award
    was handed to another distinguished pilot who has been previously decorated for
    their service in the Amarr militia forces.  According to Admiral Blake, who spoke
    about her service after joining the militia, \"...[she has] proved herself not
    only to be a capable combat pilot but also an excellent fleet commander, running
    many successful operations...\"  PIE Inc. recognized **Jodie Amille** as Amarrian
    Capsuleer of the Year.     \n\nFor their achievements, the winning capsuleers
    received Navy Issue warships from PIE Inc.  Nephilim Xeno received a Navy Issue
