    Vale of the Silent** \\- R.A.G.E alliance engaged and killed an Inver Brass freighter
    and its escort on the 27.12.112 as it passed through Northern Coalition-controlled
    space. The freighter contained exotic dancers, tobacco and alcohol intended as
    an eccentric gift for captains fighting on the northern front.   \n  \nThe mixed-alliance
    freighter convoy was [first engaged in NCGR-Q](http://eve-kill.net/?a=kill_related&kll_id=8383113)
    by a fleet of over 250 ships from Majesta Empire, R.A.G.E., Stella Polaris and
    other Northern Coalition alliances, which was returning home after an engagement
    nearby. The escort was caught while split - some of the ships were already in
    warp - and a large portion of the contingent was wiped out, leaving less than
    30 of the original 80 - 90 ships, but the Charon freighter managed to escape into
    U54-1L. The NC fleet pursued and [the Inver Brass freighter and its escort were
    finally destroyed](http://eve-kill.net/?a=kill_related&kll_id=8383073).   \n  \nThe
    total ISK loss of the freighter and its contents totalled at just over 2.8 billion
    ISK, with exotic dancers costing 59 million ISK, tobacco worth 8 million ISK,
    and spirits worth just over two billion ISK.   \n  \nCzech Lion, one of the escort
    pilots, said that the freighter was a new addition to a roaming fleet his community
    holds periodically - their \"8th gank night\" - and that the expedition ended
    in high spirits, although they were dismayed that so many supplies were destroyed
    in the freighter's explosion.   \n  \nOne NC pilot, who wished to remain anonymous,
    said that they were pleasantly surprised by the contents of the Inver Brass freighter,
    which they had previously speculated was shipping materiel for the start of a
    sovereignty war, but that he was too hungover to comment further and wanted to
    go back to bed.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this article? Do
