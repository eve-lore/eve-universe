    Nation forces have begun an invasion of the Caldari State Solar System Tama.**

    This invastion comes in Light of their previous hostile appearance within the
    Solar System Ashab within Amarrian Territory.   \n  \nThe invasion began at 22:00,
    with a mere 20 residents in the system being caught by surprise.   \n  \nNew Eden
    capsuleers are converging on the solar system in an effort to either support the
    Sansha forces by defending their fleet or by beginning an offensive on all Sansha\u2019s
    Nation vessels and supporting capsuleers.   \n  \n[![](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4353/sanshaforcesbattlewithcapsuleersimagethumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F4353%2Fsanshaforcesbattlewithcapsuleersimage.png)
    JiaLei Lian, member of pro-Sansha alliance Shaktipat Revelators, explained that
    she would support the decisions of Sansha, \u201CMy 'opinion' is that the Tama
    system has seen much conflict. If the Master wishes operations to continue here,
    I trust his wisdom.\u201D   \n  \nSectorClear, anti-Sansha capsuleer of the corporation
    Terminal Logic, explained his views on the invasion, \u201DIt's sad to see that
    the majority of pilots continues to undermine the efforts that capsuleers put
    into stopping the Sansha menace.\u201D   \n  \nMallet, member and pirate of Session
    Changes alliance, gave his individual reason for entering Tama, \u201Cto be honest
    this is just a chance for us \u2018security status challenged people\u2019 to
    kill random people\u201D   \n  \nAt the time of writing, over 130 pilots are present
    in Tama, supporting or defending the Sansha\u2019s Nation fleet. \n\n### GalNet
