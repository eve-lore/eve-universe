    on the return of Celtic Anarchy corporation, founder SkyFox stated \"[The possibility
    of] rebuilding the Force of Evil alliance is something that is always under discussion...\"
    As of the 15th of this month, that possibility has become fact.\n\nForce Of Evil
    has returned under the executorship of self-proclaimed \"Dark Queen\" Foyle, who
    manages FOE Holding. Other corporations currently rallied under the banner are,
    as expected, Celtic Anarchy, Quam Singulari, Euphoria Released [E-R], Domination.,
    Fire Mandrill and Darkness and Chaos.\n\nCorp 1 Allstars will remain in PuPPet
    MasTers until after [Alliance Tournament VI](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmyeve.eve-online.com%2Fingameboard.asp%3Fa%3Dchannel%26channelID%3D422285),
    but CEO C4w3 confirms that they will be rejoining their former comrades in arms
    after their competitive obligations are fulfilled.\n\nViper Shizzle of Pandemic
    Legion predicted the reformation on 20.12.110, citing intelligence received from
    Rejected Enlightenment of Otherworld Empire Productions, who said:\n\n\"E-R, Corp1,
    Celtic Anarcy, Fire Mandrill, Phantom Squadron, THE MuPPeT FaCTOrY, Quam Singulari,
    FOE, Better Dead Then Smeg. Sounds like FOE to me.\"\n\nLike Corp 1 Allstars,
    THE MuPPeT FaCTOrY and Better Dead Then Smeg are currently in PuPPet MasTers.
    OrDeR of THE MuPPeT FaCTOrY stated:\n\n\"We have been asked to join FOE but we
    still are borderline on whether we will join or not. FOE does have some very good
    corporations (PMS do fly with FOE everyday) and does look very promising. I would
    put [the] question under a \"maybe,\" depending on how the alliance tournament
    turns out and variety of other small factors, but we are giving no answer yet.\"\n\nC4w3
    talked a little about future plans for FOE:\n\n\"We have no hidden agenda or something
    like that. All we want to do is provide awesome [pilot vs pilot combat] for old
    and new friends. Try new ideas, setups etc and take our experience to a new level.
    We live by the words 'Take your space without claiming it.'\n\n\"Very few alliances
    have deeper roots or a more legendary history.\"\n\nAsked if any particular memories
    stood out, he cited an old battle between FOE and Band of Brothers and allies
    CCCP:\n\n\"They had massive numbers of Scorpion-class electronic warfare battleships,
    so we countered with Ravens fitted with Friend or Foe Cruise Missiles, and super
    long range sniper Tempests. We had some really great battles in the early days
    of mass fleet [combat].\"\n\nFOE are not the only ones with memories, however,
    and there are those who claim that the reformation of FOE is simply an act of
    nostalgia, doomed to failure. One such is Triumvirate pilot, Gjs312:\n\n\"I would
    like to be the first to predict a failure of previously unheard of proportions.
    Imagine an airliner full of Quafe Ultra crashing into a Mindclash stadium.\"\n\nThe
    reformed alliance has currently placed itself into the Fountain conflict, where
    they set their guns equally against all those fighting for the region, including
    Band of Brothers, Sons of Tangra, Pandemic Legion and their training corporation
    SniggWaffe and many others. C4W3 claims that FOE, between its current members
    and those who intend to return, are claiming up to 100 killmails a day in the
    area. When asked why FOE chose to fight all sides in the area, C4w3 explained:\n\n\"Our
    members shouldn't have to choose just one. Both sides are deserving of our love.\"\n\n###
