- body: "**Z-70K1, Omist** \\- On 01.05.111, GoonSwarm purported to have stolen capital
    ship components for 3 titans and a Nyx mothership from Atlas Alliance. Atlas dispute
    the claim, alleging that the Titan parts in GoonSwarm's hands belonged to the
    departing pilot himself and had never been Atlas property. This article examines
    the claims of both sides and the evidence presented.\n\nAvatar-pilot Sasheria
    Windsong defected to GoonSwarm from Phantom Squad corporation of Atlas with a
    number of close associates including monkeyking1 and Tamerlane Kahn. They took
    with him a number of capital parts - both the number and the original ownership
    of those parts is being disputed by the two alliances.\n\nGoonSwarm Intelligence
    Agency chief The Mittani greeted Atlas Alliance on GalNet with the words \"Gotcha
    titan(s).\"\n\nGoonSwarm member Helen then presented three images as evidence
    of the theft: one of a contract of capital parts and two shots of capital parts
    in a hangar. A further image showed some 25,000 units of Promethium, the theft
    of remains undisputed to date.\n\n### The Images  \n\n\nGoonSwarm member Talzaris
    commented \"I only see enough parts for 1 titan in that contract. Though I don't
    understand the reason for the 2 identical [shots] of parts after that. Someone
    explain.\"\n\nExamination of the two hangar shots showed they were indeed not
    just of identical sets of items, but were in fact the same image shown twice in
    succession. The contract was for the same quantities of the same types of items
    and contained no information that could be used to prove or disprove whether it
    was, in fact, the same items from the hangar image simply placed in a contract.\n\nClaims
    of the magnitude of the consignment of capital parts are therefore open to question.\n\n###
    \"The Mittani Sends His Regards\"\n\nAt 19:10, Tamerlane Kahn sent a message to
    Atlas' alliance mail stating only \"The Mittani sends his regards.\" These were
    the words previously included in a Black Nova Corp wallet transaction when former
    director Haargoth Agamar robbed the corporation, kicked out members and disbanded
    Band of Brothers alliance with his associate Arkannen. GoonSwarm posted an image
    of the message being received as evidence of their infiltration of Atlas.\n\nIn
    the background of this image, Phantom Squad's corporate communication channel
    can be seen. Krissi ivg's expression of alarm was perhaps the most dramatic:\n\n\"We've
    been royally [expletive deleted].\"\n\nEvidence of the effect of a crippling theft
    or a reaction to the potential threat implied by the message? Krissi ivg explained:\n\n\"[When
    I said that], I had only seen the mail. [I only knew] the fact that monkeyking1
    and his [associates] had left for goons; [I'd seen] the alliance mail [and] with
    The Mittani's past work, it couldn't have been good.\"\n\nBobby Atlas, leader
    of Atlas Alliance, added:\n\n\"Regarding Krissi and also some other comments Goons
    highlight from screenshots of our alliance chat, it was after-effects from the
    Goon thread on CAOD and alliance mail spam - people had assumed that we had gotten
    ripped off, naturally, when first looking at the thread which cascaded through
    corporations in various degree's of shock.\n\n\"Once things had been assessed
    of who was actually involved it became clear what the situation was and that it
    was nothing more than a disgruntled member flaring drama for Goons on his exodus.
    Perhaps our only regret is knowing he was leaving and letting him leave safely
    with his titan and his component kit.\"\n\n### Access\n\nBobby Atlas claims that
    neither Captain Windsong nor any of her fellow defectors had access to critical
    alliance assets, though she was able to remove Promethium from a silo at one of
    their moon mining towers:\n\n\"The member in question was in a newer corp in Atlas,
    the member itself being new to that corp. In and of itself, that would mean we
    would have had to trust one of our youngest corps and newest members with alliance
    assets; that is a little foolish considering the number and maturity of long standing
    corps already existing in our alliance.\n\n\"Obviously the loss of a titan pilot
    is one you take note of but in this case the pilot is one we held in questionable
    state since [she] came to Atlas from those we have negative standings towards.\"\n\n###
    A Spare Titan?\n\nAyman Zahawiri of GoonSwarm questioned the credibility of claims
    that Sasheria Windsong, given she already possessed one Titan, would own component
    sets to build more.\n\nBobby Atlas replies: \"Sasheria hops alliances frequently,
    is a heavy industrialist (nothing wrong with that) and... [she] is an inherently
    wealthy person...\""
