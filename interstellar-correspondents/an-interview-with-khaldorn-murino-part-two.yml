- body: "**Arielle deVoir:** Are you concerned about the safety of Eckarine Mitumi?
    \ \n**Khaldorn Murino:** You mean Eckarine Hnolku, I take it? We swore a blood
    oath to free her, and we do not take such things lightly. We had a location on
    her in the Bleak Lands, but were unable to effect a rescue before the Amarrians
    started a war against the Blood Raiders. Our agents search for her in the new
    Blood lands, but without success at the moment. But rest assured, we swore to
    the doctor that we would save his wife - and we will.  \n**Arielle deVoir:** What
    was your reaction to the recent news about Mrs. Mitumi-Hnolku?  \n**Khaldorn Murino:**
    It cannot be easy with those fanatics, they are truly the most depraved scum\u2026
    but if this news is anything to go by then we have failed her as well as the doctor.
    I do not like to think what the bloods will do with her knowledge. How could we
    help? By doing what we do best \u2013 fighting. If we found out her location,
    I have faith we could retrieve her. You would be surprised, after years of raiding
    the Amarr Empire for our people, at what we can do, my dear. And we owe those
    Bloods.  \n**Arielle deVoir:** What do you think the Bloodraiders will use the
    Cure for?  \n**Khaldorn Murino:** Now? Who can say? They used it to attack the
    Empire before, to devastating effect, but they left our people to die! They are
    unpredictable. But I would say their hate for the Empire has, if anything, only
    increased.  \n**Arielle deVoir:** Do you think the Amarr Empire will stop the
    Blood Raiders in time?  \n**Khaldorn Murino:** They have forced them away from
    their previous base. I would say the threat of attack has reduced. The Amarr Empire
    is sometimes slow to react, but we have learnt not to underestimate them. To answer
    your question, I cannot say for sure. The best we can hope for is to react quickly
    and rescue as many of our people as we can. We were too late at Mabnen.  \n**Arielle
    deVoir:** A very unfortunate event that was. Do you have anything to add in closing?
    \ \n**Khaldorn Murino:** To organisations and people reading this news piece,
    if you have the ability to help us, you can save countless people from a life
    of torment. Help us. Help our people.   \n**Arielle deVoir:** Would you welcome
    people willing to join your alliance or corporation to offer protection if it
    will be needed?   \n**Khaldorn Murino:** If they can help us, then we will do
    our best to protect them. We always welcome fighters for freedom, but we have
    a few tricks up our sleeves yet.   \n**Arielle deVoir:** Vice Admiral Murino of
    the Ushra\u2019Khan, thank you for your time.   \n**Khaldorn Murino:** Thank you,
    Miss deVoir. Fly free."
