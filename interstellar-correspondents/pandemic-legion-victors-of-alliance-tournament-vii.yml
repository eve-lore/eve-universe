    Legion has taken the championship in Alliance Tournament VII over Circle-of-Two.
    Both teams proved their worth over the six days of the tournament.  \n  \nPandemic
    Legion came into the final match with five flawless victories out of six matches.
    Circle-of-Two's matches have been more mixed with several close calls and not
    a single flawless victory among them.  \n  \nFor the final match, Pandemic Legion
    pulled out their trusty bomber fleet and employed it with great success alongside
    a wave of drones. The initial savaging of a pair of Hurricanes and a Thrasher
    threw Circle-of-Two off stride and they only managed to take out a single Pandemic
    Legion Rook before losing the fight.  \n  \nDespite the loss, newcomer Circle-of-Two
    will still walk away with a very healthy 30 billion ISK, 10 5-run Freki frigate
    blueprint copies, and the silver medal.  \n  \nPandemic Legion can now add 50
    billion ISK, 10 5-run copies of the Mimir cruiser, gold medal, and the much coveted
    Alliance Tournament Cup to their war chest.  \n  \n **Read more at our dedicated
