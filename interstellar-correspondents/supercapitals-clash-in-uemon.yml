    The Forge** \\-- During the late hours of 113.02.14 a massive supercapital battle
    between Northern Coalition forces and the Eastern Block lead to the loss of 12
    Titans.  \n  \nOne of the largest supercapital battles in New Eden occurred in
    Uemon, a low security system used by the Eastern block as a staging system for
    their attacks on the Geminate Region which is mostly now under control of the
    Northern Coalition.  \n  \nWhile the Northern Coalition forces (mainly Morsus
    Mihi, Razor, Mostly Harmless, Majesta Empire, Brick Squad and RAGE) fielded 18
    titans, 45 supercarriers and 121 capital ships, the Eastern Block (mainly Red
    Alliance, White Noise, SOLAR FLEET, Raiden and Legion of xXDeathXx) had 14 titans,
    85 supercarriers and 38 capital ships. Subcapital support fleets entered the system
    later.  \n  \nAccording to Silent Dodger from Red Alliance, the battle began when
    the Northern Coalition jumped into Uemon to kill several White Noise dreadnoughts.
    Simultaneously the Eastern Block jumped supercarriers to a friendly control tower
    where one supercarrier strayed beyond the shields; he was spotted by the NC, attacked
    and killed.  \n  \nSupercarrier reinforcements from the Eastern block followed
    swiftly. Silent Dodger explained the fast response that \"every one of us understand
    that such opportunities are rare\". He added: \"That was epic.\"  \n  \nDuring
    several hours of heavy fighting, the NC lost 10 titans and 5 supercarrier, the
    Eastern Block lost 2 titans and 2 supercarriers. 36 capital ships were killed,
    the Eastern Block losing 4 of them.  \n  \nThe exact fleet compositions and losses
    are disputable but this battle is one of the largest supercapital battles in New
    Eden's history and the total losses in ISK are impressive.  \n  \nAttempts to
    contact additional involved parties were unsuccessful at the time of writing.\n\n###
