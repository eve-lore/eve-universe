    sponsoring a writing contest, wherein he wants to hear pilot-authored  stories
    of the people of New Eden.   \n  \nWhereas much of the news and fiction popular
    amongst pilots surrounds the comings and goings of the capsuleer community, this
    contest will judge the best story concerning the doings of any citizen _other_
    than a capsuleer.   \n  \nSilver Night reminded potential entrants that there
    is more to New Eden than spacecraft, stating that there are also \"mining colonies,
    planets, moons and stations\" adding \"the possibilities are nearly limitless.\"
    \  \n  \nThe prizes range from rare pirate faction battleships with 300 million
    isk provided for fittings, to Fleet-issue battleships and cruisers.   \n  \nEntries
    for Silver Night's contest can be up to 3,000 words long and must be submitted
    by 21:55 on the 21.03.112.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Silver's First Annual
