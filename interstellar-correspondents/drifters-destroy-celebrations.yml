    Strikes As Drifters Attack Capsuleer Celebration\n\n![](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/67370/1/2015.06.27.17.04.17.png)\n\nCuratores
    Veritatis Alliance [CVA] was celebrated its 12th birthday on June 27th in Sarum
    Prime at approximately 16:00 New Eden Time. The celebration included a great display
    of Amarr unity, as called for by Empress Jamyl Sarum . Some capsuleers had been
    waiting in the system for over two hours to participate in the event. In addition
    to over 200 capsuleers, the Amarr navy was also present.\n\nAmong the many speeches
    JedsZero had this to say: \"The presence of Drifter Battleships in the most secure\u2026
    and most sacred\u2026 areas of Amarr Space cannot be allowed. This is why the
    Empress is attempting to bring unity and stability to New Eden.\"\n\nWithin minutes
    of that statement, Drifter ships arrived on scene; not one or two but en masse,
    an entire fleet ready to rain destruction and strike fear. Their actions seemed
    to be solely on disrupting any organized attempt at keeping them from Amarr space.
    The number of ships destroyed is still unknown as is the value of the losses.
    Early estimates are over 12 billion isk destroyed in a matter of minutes.\n\n![](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/67370/1/2015.06.27.17.09.24.png)\n\nOne
    of the most costly losses was the Marauder flown by Lt. Ethidium Bromide of Praetoria
    Imperialis Excubitoris [PIE] worth an estimated 1.75 billion isk. When interviewed
    in regards to the events of that fateful day he commented that \"the timing of
    the attack seems very, shall we say, deliberate\". \n\nAfter the combined efforts
    of [CVA], [PIE] and allies had decimated the majority of the Drifter fleet Lt.
    Ethidium Bromide came into the focus of 4 Drifter battleships and he recalls that
    \"The damage dealt by the Drifters was substantial and my armor repair module
    could not hold up. The crew did their best to overheat all stabilizing modules
    but in the end the TES RIGHTEOUSNESS was destroyed within seconds.\"\n\nMany mourn
    the losses of the great battle but Lt. Ethidium Bromide said \"I mourn the death
    of many good women and men not only aboard my ship but also on the ships of our
    fellow loyalists. This engagement showed that the Drifters are a threat to all
    of New Eden!\""
