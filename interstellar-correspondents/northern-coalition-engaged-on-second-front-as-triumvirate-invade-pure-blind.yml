    in P-2TTL](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3661/titansp2ttlthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F3661%2Ftitansp2ttl.png)Last
    week, on 08.01.112, an Avatar-class titan from Northern Coalition alliance Morsus
    Mihi was destroyed by a fleet from Triumvirate and their allies while they were
    reinforcing towers in the Northern Coalition's forward base system, ROIR-Y.   \n
    \ \nThe fleet, led by Kai Page of Triumvirate, featured a large contingent of
    cloaking, cruise missile-fitted Ravens and planned to reinforce a few Northern
    Coalition control towers before moving on to a roaming operation.  \n  \nSpaceSavage,
    director of Triumvirate corporation Tr0pa de elite, explained: \"Two towers were
    put into reinforced and then we hit the third; a few of our allies were there
    too. About halfway through hitting the 3rd tower, our covops, flown by Trinity
    Angel reported a hostile Avatar cynoing in at another [tower], about 15 seconds
    later reporting another Avatar titan cynoing in. The order was given to align
    to the cyno, and dictors go at zero.\"   \n  \nThe Triumvirate fleet was joined
    on the field by vessels from their ally, RED.Overlord, who also began to \"bump\"
    the primary target, the Avatar piloted by sNaKe353. The large, clumsy titan was
    continually rammed off its trajectory while it tried to get safely inside the
    shields of the nearby control tower.   \n  \nSpaceSavage continued: \"At points
    he was extremely close to the shield, and we had a total of 3 hostile titans aggressed
    on our fleet, killing our battleships: two Avatars, one Erebus.   \n  \n\"About
    half way through his armour, dreads cynoed in, from both sides. Our ally Initative
    bridged in too, approximately 60 or so. Slowly the titan was dying, eventually
    going into structure but not before taking out one of our dreads, Brother Assembly,
    who died a hero's death!\" Battleship casualties were significant on both sides.
    \  \n  \nThe second Northern Coalition Avatar managed to get inside the control
    tower's shields and NC forces engaged with the Triumvirate gang in multiple skirmishes
    between ROIR-Y and the Triumvirate \"home\" system of X-7OMU during the remainder
    of the night.   \n  \nConflict had also been taking place in and around the Mostly
    Harmless station system of P-2TTL. Since the start of the year, forces from Triumvirate
    and their allies had challenged the sovereignty of the system. Multiple large
    battles were fought with the loss, SpaceSavage claims, of thousands of ships across
    the two sides. This led Mynas Atoch (Mostly Harmless FC and alliance leadership-figure)
    to issue a [public declaration of defiance](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a%3Dtopic%26threadID%3D1238399)
    to the hostile forces.   \n  \nOn 10.01.112, however, combined forces from Triumvirate's
    coalition (known as \"TriCo\" after members Triumvirate and Circle of Two), gathered
    for the final conflict, a do-or-die moment for the system... which passed quietly,
    the system trickling into new hands without engagement.   \n  \nImperian, FC and
    military organizer for the Northern Coalition during this campaign, explained
    the campaign objectives for his organization:   \n  \n\"The problem is, I guess,
    that both sides have a different understanding of 'winning.' Their goal was to
    take over the P-2TTL station system. Our goal is to get our high-end and technetium
    moons back in Pure Blind and Venal.   \n  \n\"We were successful at reclaiming
    our Venal moons already and go for the Pure Blind moons now. We killed 4 of theirs
    today without big resistance and replaced them with our own ones.\"  \n  \nImperian
    confirmed that at present, the Northern Coalition is focusing on the TriCo invasion
    as the main threat, working as a unit rather than individual alliances and focusing
    on the Pure Blind front. By reclaiming valuable moons, NC ensure their warchest
    for a sustained conflict. TriCo, meanwhile, have little regard for strategic assets
    and a hunger for battle. The coalition plans to keep pressure on the NC and \"kill
    as much as possible, pick apart the NC one bit at a time and disband their coalition.\"
    The two mindsets, though radically different, both point to one thing: a sustained
    and hard-fought war.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Triumvirate. Battle Record -
