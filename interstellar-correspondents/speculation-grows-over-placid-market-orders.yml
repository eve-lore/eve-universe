- body: "Following last weeks reports of unusual buy orders in the Placid region,
    bars and other gathering places popular with merchants in key stations along the
    regions trade routes have been awash with rumours concerning the motivations of
    Jevako Niedboux, the man at the centre of these extraordinary dealings.   \n  \nGossip
    and conjecture between traders increased today when Niedboux updated his market
    buy orders requesting further volumes of small arms and Caldari officer insignias,
    as well as placing several new orders for marines numbering in their thousands
    and offering significant sums of money to those willing to transport these soldiers
    of fortune into the Placid region.   \n  \nThese latest additions have lent some
    modicum of credibility to the speculations that the former small time dealer is
    receiving considerable outside funding for these new and wholly uncharacteristic
    business practices.   \n  \nFar wilder suggestions have been put forward that
    Niedboux may be constructing a private army on behalf of his supposed benefactor
    for some as yet unknown purpose; though for now at least, few have subscribed
    to this rampant rumour and hearsay.   \n  \nOver the past week several sightings
    have also been reported of increased activity by Caldari customs agents along
    the State\u2019s borders closest to the Placid region; though one source within
    the Caldari Navy was quick to point out that there was no connection between these
    strange happenings and the routine reinforcement of customs agents and navy personnel
    along Caldari borders, citing that it was \u201Cmerely coincidence\u201D.   \n
    \ \nReacting to this news, several Caldari loyalist corporations and individuals
    have also come forward on the Gal-net communications network and offered a substantial
    bounty for the proven death of Jevako Niedboux. Apparently enraged that Niedboux's
    request for Caldari navy insignias would incite violence against navy personnel
    from unscrupulous and opportunistic individuals. Their combined offer of over
    twenty million ISK for the head of the dealer has so far met with mixed responses
    of support and objective criticism from members of both empires.   \n  \n[You
