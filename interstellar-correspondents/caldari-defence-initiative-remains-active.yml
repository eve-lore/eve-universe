    Eden** \\- More than two months after the signing of the [Caldari Defence Initiative](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1323211),
    the pact remains alive and well, as shown by recent cooperative efforts.  \n  \nAccording
    to eddie valvetino, CEO of the Bi-Polar Bears and a fleet commander with the Gallente
    Federation, \"Since the forming of the CDI, they [Amarr and Caldari Forces] have
    been a lot more active together... To be honest, the only time the Caldari really
    get a good fleet up and go for a fight, you can be sure they have backup from
    the Amarr.\"  \n  \nWhile strength in numbers appears to be one benefit of the
    CDI, strengthening cooperation and organization appears to be another goal. Gunnyt31,
    Fleet Commander and Senior Member of Inglorious-Basterds [I.B.S.], says, \"The
    CDI will hopefully minimize the chaos that is created by high sec war decs while
    forming fleets in our main systems.\"  \n  \nIn the past, corporations at war
    stood alone as hired mercenaries picked them out of militia fleets. To counter
    this, Gunnyt31 explains; \"If one of the CDI Corp [has war declared upon them]
    then they [all CDI member corps] come in to assist that corp.\" Stalking Mantis,
    member of I.B.S. adds; \"[..this allows] the [militia] corporations to focus on
    the actual war with the Gallente without being sidetracked by Mercs...\"  \n  \n\"[Militia
    warfare] seems very unwelcoming at the beginning to newer pilots\u2026 there are
    loads of [fighting] never too far to be had once [the pilot] gets a solid reputation
    as a pilot and not a potential spy.\" states Stalking Mantis, voicing a major
    security concern. With the CDI now in place and the combined fleets being fielded,
    eddie valvetino states, \"Our intelligences and spy networks now have to include
    the Amarr.\" When asked about the level of concern about the apparent successes
    of the CDI, he adds, \"This is the ebb and flow of New Eden. Corps, alliances
    and coalitions grow, become powerful and they then collapse.\"  \n  \nWhether
    the CDI will fade away with time remains to be seen, but by all accounts, the
    larger multi-factional fleets fielded recently have caused some disruption to
    the Gallente militia and forced them to adapt. What remains to be seen is how
    the militias will retain the pilots that cut their teeth in battle fighting for
    the ideals and survival of their Nations.\n\n### Galnet References\n\n[Caldari
