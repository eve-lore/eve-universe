    member of Curatores Veratitas Alliance(CVA), Epitoth Fleetyards has been a key
    player in providing for the material and logistical needs of the member corporations
    for some time. In fact, they are credited with the deployment of two outposts,
    the most recent being in the Providence Region.\n\nNow veterans of several hard
    fought campaigns, during which the members of Epitoth Fleetyards often acted in
    both a logistical and a frontline capacity, the corporation has decided to sharpen
    its focus to a primarily combat outfit. In the words of their CEO, Grr, \"Constant
    war over the past three years had already battle hardened us, and despite our
    industrial success we were very much a wolf in sheep's clothing\" Out of that
    declaration a new corporation was born, Epitoth Guard(E.G.).\n\nThe move to create
    the new corporation was met with congratulatory remarks from friends and allies
    of the corporation. However, Kazzzi a member from the Minmatar Ship Construction
    Services(MSCS) and Ushra'Khan alliance, long time nemesis of the Epitoth corporations,
    had this to say, \"If their pride demands a new name to reflect their militant
    stance then so be it. I'll be happy to watch their ships burn no matter what insignia
    they bear.\"\n\nGALNET Resources:\n\n[Official Announcement](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1023459)\n\n
