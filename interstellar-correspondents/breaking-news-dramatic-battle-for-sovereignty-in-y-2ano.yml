    \ \n[![IT Pilot Patrolling Y-2ANO T.C.U.](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3651/patrollingthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3651/patrolling.png)According
    to sources inside Pandemic Legion, the clash began when IT alliance attempted
    to seize Y-2ANO following a botched sovereignity transfer between the system's
    former holder - Sons Of Tangra - and Goonswarm alliance.   \n  \nPreliminary reports
    indicate that IT Alliance pilots discretely onlined a Tactical Control Unit yesterday
    afternoon. After that, they set up several staging points and ammassed a fleet
    of over 600 ships to defend the unit. The fleet reportedly comprised several titans
    along with capital and support vessels.   \n  \nPandemic Legion and its allies
    rallied to storm the onlining TCU to prevent the system falling to IT Alliance.
    Pandemic Legion's fleet reportedly comprised 5 titans, several capital vessels
    and support, totaling around 700 units.   \n  \nWith so many massive vessels in
    close proximity, spatial distortion can ensue. Xodius Raldari, a titan pilot who
    flies under Pandemic Legion's banner, described how the fight was influenced by
    the distortion. \"Most of our capitals [succesfully jumped into the system]...
    then a spatial distortion happened... there was no fight at all, apart from some
    few support and bombers we managed to kill.\"   \n  \nViper ShizzIe, CEO of Pandemic
    Legion corporation The Illuminati, added \"Those who managed to jump out... still
    died... their hulls appearing where the cyno was lit hours later, unpiloted!\"
    \  \n  \nAJ Regard, an IT Alliance pilot, confirmed that there were 3 titan wrecks
    on the field after the battle. \"Locator agents have [searched for the pilots
    of] all 4 titans, showing their pilots now in stations. So, unless titans can
    now dock, there are 4 dead titans,\" he says.   \n  \nThe Y-2ANO battle is framed
    in the larger-scale conflict between IT Alliance, Pandemic Legion and Goonswarm.
    \"Y-2ANO was rather important as it's close to Goonswarm's territory... We tried,
    we lost, [we] didn't want that titan anyways,\" Xodius Raldari ultimately says.
    \  \n  \nDue to the extremely chaotic situation following the clash, battle reports
    are still flowing from the region and the presented figures may change in the
    next hours. Interstellar Correspondents will monitor the situation and report
    as soon as further details are available.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Pandemic
