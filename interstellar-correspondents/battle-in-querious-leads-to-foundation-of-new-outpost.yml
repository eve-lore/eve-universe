    in the Querious region following a short but violent conflict between alliances
    based in the south. Firmus Ixion was defending their latest outpost construction
    effort with gathered allies against a vicious attack launched by Against All Authorities
    (AAA) from the Catch region. \n\nFIX have been residents of the Querious region
    for quite a considerable length of time, and have had to contest the region countless
    times in the past. The previous attempt at constructing an outpost in the same
    system was foiled previously by the Band of Brothers (BoB) alliance; however,
    in New Eden's forever changing political climate, FIX and BoB are now allies.
    \n\nAvernus, FIX's diplomatic contact remarked about the conflict that began over
    the second attempt at construction; \"logistically, we were well prepared to overcome
    the challenge. However, logistics was the least of our problems. The alliance,
    AAA, got wind of our operation and brought forth some serious opposition in an
    attempt to impede our efforts, and destroy the outpost if possible.\" Pilots from
    Red Alliance and the Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate were also present in the
    attacking forces, although AAA have said that there was no time for prior arrangements,
    and the outside assistance was spontaneous. Amongst the defenders were pilots
    from Band of Brothers and the Mercenary Coalition, and Avernus also offered \"a
    debt of gratitude to...Elite Storm Enterprises, Digital Fury Corporation, and
    The Clearwater Society\". \n\nDue to logistics delays brought on by enemy attacks,
    the construction of the outpost was delayed to a second day. During the battles
    involving the system chosen for the outpost, over 650 ships were destroyed over
    a period of 30 hours, including numerous capital ship losses throughout both sides.
    Despite formidable opposition, construction of the outpost was completed, consolidating
    FIX's hold on the area. \n\nWhen asked about FIX's intention's regarding this
    venture, Avernus responded \"FIX isn't in a rush; however we have a set of goals
    that are continuously being worked towards\". While the Querious region is currently
    marked as the territory of Band of Brothers, FIX hope that this will put them
    back on New Eden's political map after a period of absence. \n\nRepresentatives
    of AAA declined to give comment on the situation at this time."
