- body: "LUMINAIRE \u2013 I received an invitation from Inspector Xavier, the newly
    appointed commander of the regional Drugs Squad of Placid, to his office at the
    headquarters of the Federation Customs. \n\nHe was very keen on explaining to
    me what his team had done during the four weeks of their deployment within the
    region. Currently this part of space is seeing a major increase in the usage of
    the drug \u2018Rise', so I accepted his invitation and after inspecting his new
    team we got down to business over a bottle of wine. \n\n_\u201CFirst off, what
    is \u2018Rise'?\u201D_\n\n\u201CRise is a drug that greatly increases the ability
    of people to remember long forgotten memories and in the case of those who have
    been Reborn, they can regain many memories of their past lives, which can make
    these people seem extremely wise.\u201D \n\n_\u201CSurely that's a good thing
    for those that believe in being Reborn?\u201D_\n\n\u201CIf only that were true.
    There is no scientific evidence that the hallucinations these addicts experience
    are realistic flashbacks. The way Rise works is to block receptors in the brain,
    extinguishing the reality of what a users senses are telling them, and replace
    their perceptions with memories that may or may not be true. Imagine a Holoreel
    that has been wiped and rewritten. There will still be old data in the areas not
    written over, but who is to say that the raw data is a correct, complete, in the
    right order and in context? It is a real shame that the Intaki people seem drawn
    to this drug; and it is clear Sarpati has done his market research well.\u201D
    \n\n_\u201CBut independent experiments have shown no proof of this\u201D_\n\n\u201CWho
    are you more likely to believe? A backstreet chemist with a few chemicals and
    interested in turning a profit; or our scientists in the best laboratories the
    Federation can offer? \n\n_\u201CEven so, this drug is purely recreational, what
    harm is there? The Federation is notoriously the most forward thinking of the
    four Empires; surely you're just stopping the people having a little fun?\u201D_\n\n\u201COur
    scientists have determined that prolonged exposure to Rise can lead to lesions
    on the brain, which in turn will lead to a painful and prolonged death. In the
    short term, a Rise overdose can cause convulsions, heart failure and a depression
    of the vital brain centres that control respiration; leading ultimately to death
    by asphyxiation.\u201D \n\n_\u201CSo what steps are you taking to remove the threat
    of Rise?\u201D_\n\n\u201CAs you know, my recently formed specialist unit deployed
    to Placid almost four weeks ago. Although we are still in the early stages of
    our work we have already collected a great deal of information on the activities
    of the Serpentis. Obviously, it would not be prudent for me to reveal any details
    of an ongoing investigation but rest assured we are pursuing our goal a great
    passion and I am confident that you will be seeing the real results of our work
    in the near future\u201D \n\n_\u201CDo you have anything to say to your critics?
    There are rumours that independent pod-pilots and their corporations are having
    more success than you\u2026.\u201D_\n\n\u201C\u201CI am aiming to cut the head
    off this snake in one movement. The involvement of Illoren and other independent
    corporations is in fact slowing down the progress of my investigation. I am not
    in the business of chasing shadows.\u201D \n\n_\u201CThank you for your time,
    Inspector.\u201D_"
