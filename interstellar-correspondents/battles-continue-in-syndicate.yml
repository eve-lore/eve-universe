- body: "Yet another major battle occured tonight in the VV-VCR system of the Syndicate
    region between the forces of JQA/3rd Front Alliance and a loose coalition of ex-Curse
    Alliance corporations. Despite a valiant effort on their part, and a great deal
    of determination, the JQA/3rd Front forces were overmatched. This is the latest
    in a series of battles that have occured over the last week within syndicate between
    these two groups.  \n  \nWhen asked before the battle about the fighting, Clipped
    Wings of the 3rd Front Alliance had this to say. \"Well, we were taken somewhat
    by surprise at the tenacity of the ex-Curse Alliance pilots at first. It's a matter
    of adapting. They won the last night's combat in VV-VCR, but when fighting here,
    in our homeland, we have stood fast. (We are)determined. This is our home. We
    will fight, until we have nothing left to fight with. And we are looking forward
    to once again freeing this space, that we may realise our ideals: To make Syndicate
    a safer place to be for the innocents.\"  \n  \nWhen asked why these corporation
    had entered Syndicate, Number One of JQA had this to say. \"They are looking for
    a new home. Most of all the good pvp corps left CA. JQA are not as good at pvp
    but they have alot of heart. It is not easy to overcome people on their home ground,
    we shall fight until we are victorious. We do not take pirating in our space lightly.\"
    \ \n  \nClearly the inhabitants of the region don't intend to lie down and let
    the ex-CA members have free reign in their claimed territory. The attacking forces
    are made up of such ex-CA corporations as Supremecy, RONA-KIA, Vengeance of the
    Fallen, Armored Assassins, and Mercenary Forces.  \n  \nWhen asked why they had
    invaded Syndicate, Gareitonis of VotF had this to say, \"We're engaged in team
    molding activities, so to speak. It is not our intention to steal thier home.
    (Syndicate) We will go where the battles are best, but we will not lay claim to
    any space at this time.\"  \n  \nWhether or not this loose coalition will at some
    point lead to a more official group is yet unknown. Clearly however this is a
    force to be reckoned with. As for the future of Syndicate, it is far from decided
    on this night."
