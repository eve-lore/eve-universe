    Syndicate in Electus Matari alliance. Her story, \"True Lines,\" told the tale
    of a former slave returning to the Republic.   \n  \nSilver Night said \"Matariki's
    story stood out for me. It was artfully rendered and thought-provoking ... [it]
    held a note of hope.\"   \n  \nMatariki was pleasantly surprised by her victory.
    She explained that she aimed high with her story but was prepared for a low ranking.
    \  \n  \nAs winner of first place in Silver Night's Second Annual Fiction Contest,
    Matariki Rain will receive 300 million ISK and a faction battleship but has not
    chosen which. She said she was considering either \"a Bhaalgorn [or] a Machariel:
    definitely something with a Matari component.\"\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Silver
