- body: "YC 113.08.01 - YC 113.08.31\n\nAugust saw a large number of the alliances
    that make up the Drone Region Forces (DRF) coalition launch an assault on the
    Against All Authorities (AAA) alliance homeland of Catch. The key systems of HED-GP
    and GE-8JV have fallen to the DRF, with fighting causing a colossal 19,420 capsuleer
    vessels and structures to be destroyed by other capsuleers in Catch this month.
    \ \n  \nThis level of fighting is the highest seen in the Catch region since CONCORD
    records began in late YC109, even though Catch is one of the most actively hostile
    regions in new eden with over nine thousand losses per month on average. Of the
    19,420 losses, 2,329 were battleships, 1,429 were battlecruisers and 6,701 were
    capsules, creating what was certainly a profitable month for the cloning industry.
    \ \n  \nThis new conflict has drawn some focus away from the ongoing fighting
    in Delve, which again saw some fierce fighting. This high level of conflict has
    now lasted for three months and resulted in 13,446 capsuleer losses this month.
    Whilst lower than the last two months this is still more than double the historical
    average of around 6,000. The main participants were again the Morsus Mihi and
    Brick Squad alliances, though the Evoke alliance has also joined the conflict,
    destroying 2,632 ships for 1,327 losses this month in Delve.  \n  \nMany systems
    within EVE are notoriously dangerous, so this month CONCORD has decided to release
    information on which null security systems have seen the largest numbers of losses
    since January of YC110. The top five systems were as follows:  \n  \n<table>  \n<tr>
    \ \n<td>\n\n\n\nEC-P8R\n\n\n</td>  \n<td>\n\n\n\n131,361\n\n\n</td> </tr>  \n<tr>
    \ \n<td>\n\n\n\nHED-GP\n\n\n</td>  \n<td>\n\n\n\n131,350\n\n\n</td> </tr>  \n<tr>
    \ \n<td>\n\n\n\nM-OEE8\n\n\n</td>  \n<td>\n\n\n\n116,831\n\n\n</td> </tr>  \n<tr>
    \ \n<td>\n\n\n\nPF-346\n\n\n</td>  \n<td>\n\n\n\n101,870\n\n\n</td> </tr>  \n<tr>
    \ \n<td>\n\n\n\nN-RAEL\n\n\n</td>  \n<td>\n\n\n\n75,994\n\n\n</td> </tr> </table>\n\n
    \ \nAll of these systems share their position as being a null security entry point
    from empire space, acting as a choke point which capsuleers have to move through
    in order to get to less hostile areas of lawless space. The largest chokepoints
    of the north and south, EC-P8R and HED-GP were surprisingly only separated by
    eleven ship losses.  \n  \nStatistics for August:  \nSupercapitals destroyed:
    3 titans, 10 supercarriers  \nSupercapitals built: 23 titans, 125 supercarriers
    \ \nOutposts built: 10"
