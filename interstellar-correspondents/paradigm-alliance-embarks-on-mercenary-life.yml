    The Forge** \\- This latest part in a series of articles on the mercenary forces
    of New Eden examines newcomers, Paradigm Allliance. It was created on 112.04.18
    and claims to have taken down ships worth billions of ISK, including strategic
    cruisers and faction battleships, in the short span of its existence.   \n  \nAccording
    to Rishard DuMonte, spokesman for Paradigm, the alliance was created \"to provide
    a stable and flexible base for professional mercenary corporations to combine
    their talents and service a wide variety of contracts.\"   \n  \nParadigm Alliance
    is currently working their first contract against Providence residents Opticon
    Alliance; so far, Paradigm state they have downed approximately 300 ships valued
    at around 20 billion ISK and attribute the recent departure or closure of multiple
    corporations (5 in the last 2 weeks) from Opticon to their action.   \n  \nCannonman58102,
    CEO of Opticon Industries (executor corporation of the Opticon Alliance) issued
    a statement about the heavy losses claiming that \"We were not able to route sufficient
    numbers to high security space to counteract them (Paradigm Alliance) without
    leaving our 0.0 home undermanned.\" He also stated that his alliance has begun
    to send pilots into high security space to \"deal with the threat,\", and claimed
    that the war has turned \"more even\" during the last week of the war.   \n  \nBC
    Hastings, CEO of rival mercenary force Privateers, said that he \"would consider
    them [Paradigm] nothing in his league nor in any of the known mercenaries' league.\"
    For comparison, BC Hastings presented the statistics of his own alliance, which
    allegedly averages approximately 4000 ship-kills worth an estimated 300 billion
    ISK, per month. Privateer have roughly 5 times as many members as Paradigm at
    present, the bulk of Paradigm's numbers being made up by the 44 pilots of Maelstrom
    Crew, formerly of the Underworld Excavators alliance.   \n  \nParadigm Alliance's
    spokesman, Rishard DuMonte, said that his mercenary alliance, while only being
    just over a month old, will \"go the extra yard to find our targets, wherever
    they are and ensure that the contract goals are met.\"\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Paradigm
