    that all the long hours are paying off as we start to recapture all our lost territory
    and look forward to us being number one again, I am hoping that people will return
    to the militia once they see that we are back on top."


    The capsuleers under his command had this to say about him "...he is a good FC",
    "yeah he is", "This is not an optimal victory but it is a demonstration...of the
    might of the Caldari Militia...towards his cause.".


    The Caldari Militia was boosted by this news and are looking forward to removing
    the Gallente from the rest of the contested systems at the earliest possible opportunity.'
