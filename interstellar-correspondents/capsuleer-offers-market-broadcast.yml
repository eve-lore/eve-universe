    prices in New Eden fluctuate on a daily basis creating additional work for New
    Eden's entrepreneurs actively involved in the markets. The Eve Morning Reports
    was created by a capsuleer to ease that burden.  \n  \nThe Eve Morning Report,
    created and broadcast by Utemetsu, claims to be a very detailed, daily update
    on many mineral prices including recaps of previous prices for capsuleers to determine
    trends.  \n  \nUtemetsu recalled that compiling the information for the broadcast
    used to take a great deal of time, and involved going through each mineral's price
    history individually. The time taken to analyze the market data screens and to
    correlate the daily changes was very time consuming. With the newer direct link
    to the New Eden markets available, the information can now be compiled and delivered
    much faster.  \n  \nWhen asked which type of capsuleer he believed would find
    the reports of most value, he mentioned that even though the reports are aimed
    at those from mostly trade and industry backgrounds, the reports can be of aid
    to every New Eden capsuleer: \"In reality, all capsuleers could find this information
    useful. Even if they don't touch the market screen beyond 'sell item', it's still
    wise to have at least an idea of where price averages are.\"  \n  \nUtemetsu also
    made it clear that his shows are not to be taken as \"financial advice\" but simply
    another tool available for capsuleers to use in the pursuit of ISK.  \n  \nUtemetsu
    has expressed a keen desire to expand his reports into more diverse areas in the
    near future: \"By the end of the year I hope to have a show, or a set of shows,
    providing information on all aspects of life in New Eden; not just economics.
    War updates, segments about missioning, fitting, manufacturing, and politics.\"\n\n###
