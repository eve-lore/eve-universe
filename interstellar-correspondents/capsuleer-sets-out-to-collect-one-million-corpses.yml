    with a morbid obsession is now offering to pay for the one million corpses he
    intends to collect.  \n  \nel caido, who himself describes it as \"a crazy idea\",
    is asking for capsuleers to send him corpses via contract. He will pay ten thousand
    ISK for each corpse. To date, he has bought forty-eight corpses at a cost of 480.000
    ISK.  \n  \nWhen asked why he was collecting corpses, el caido said, \"I do not
    have a genuine answer. So many capsuleers have so many odd hobbies - this one
    is mine.\" Once he has attained his goal he hopes to be able to move them all
    to one \"classified\" location.  \n  \nel caido began collecting corpses about
    four years ago. When asked what he will do when he reaches his one million target,
    he said, \"It is something I can say I have accomplished, and then I will move
    onto other ventures, or even possibly continue building my collection beyond that.
    Two million may be a tempting target once I reach one million.\"\n\n* * *\n\nAre
