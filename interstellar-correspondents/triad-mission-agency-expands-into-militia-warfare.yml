    Molden Heath** \\- The pro-Minmatar T.R.I.A.D. corporation's mission agency, which
    first opened in 108, has expanded its offerings to include multi-pilot combat
    \"campaigns\" in the areas contested between the Minmatar and Amarr capsuleer
    militias.  \n  \nDet Resprox, CEO of T.R.I.A.D, described his operation: \"T.R.I.A.D
    is offering missions to all members of all corps, in particular the Minmatar militia
    as an alternative way of gaining loyalty points, ISK and items for killing the
    Amarr.\" The agency offers three different types of mission through their portal:
    'Marketing,' 'Combat' and 'Campaign.'  \n  \nAccording to Det Resprox, the new
    'Campaign' missions can be taken on by any registered agency member. Once a pilot
    accepts a 'Campaign', he becomes its fleet commander and other agency pilots can
    join the mission, which could take hours or days to complete depending on the
    opposition fielded. Rewards, including T.R.I.A.D. loyalty points, are paid to
    each member of a given campaign. These loyalty points can be exchanged for faction
    technology as well as tech 2 and officer-grade items.  \n  \nDet Resprox said
    that the next step for the agency will be the introduction of so-called \"Epic
    Arcs\" which will assign a pilot to chains of missions, each contributing towards
    a greater goal.  \n  \nDet Resprox said that T.R.I.A.D. offers missions against
    the Amarr and pirates in Minmatar Republic space, including efforts against the
    24th Imperial Crusade and other Amarr militia corporations such as PIE Inc. \"Anti-piracy-wise
    we are focusing on Heimatar, in particular piracy in Amamake and further out near
    Gusandall.\"  \n  \nPIE Inc is one of the corporations T.R.I.A.D. missions have
    targeted, both for their long-term stance as Amarr loyalists and for their role
    in the 24th Imperial Crusade, where they were the first corporation to be awarded
    1 million \"victory points.\" Rodj Blake, Director and diplomat for PIE Inc had
    a few comments concerning the subject, \"As I understand things, their mission
    system has only had limited impact, although I must confess that I'm unaware of
    what they've done with their missions other than effectively buy slaves. It seems
    to me that one could complete such a mission by simply buying the slaves on the
    market... what these TRIAD types are doing is nothing more than promoting kidnapping.\"
    \ \n  \nAs for T.R.I.A.D. and particularly those PIE enemies that run the missions,
    Rodj said; \"their fate will be the same as that of all terrorists - they will
    be brought to justice. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but one day, they
    will answer for their crimes.\"\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[T.R.I.A.D. Mission
