- body: "Hamish, CEO of the Tribal Trust of Pator and High Council memberof the Ushra\u2019Khan,
    was revealed to have commission the theft of Golan Trevize\u2019s prized award.
    \  \n  \nIn an open communications channel on GalNet, he confessed to have the
    Cross stolen:   \n  \n\"I have your medal in my possession. I am the one who commissioned
    its theft, although I did not carry it out personally. Since you so kindly provided
    a log of how you dealt with the hoaxer Budy, I know exactly how to deal with you
    now.   \n  \nThe medal remains in the possession of my allies, and any attempts
    on my life will be met with its destruction. Your only hope of retrieving your
    trinket is to meet me and negotiate for it - in exchange for its return; I demand
    the release of the Mamet 500 into my custody. If you wish, you may send an agent
    to meet me in private and verify through trade-window that I do indeed have it,
    so that there is no doubt in your mind as to what we're playing for here. I await
    your reply.\"   \n  \nArchbishop of PIE Inc. responded mere hours after the revelation.
    I wasn\u2019t able to speak with him directly, however. PIE Inc. member Myadra
    was able to confirm that Hamish has the Cross in his possession.   \n  \nHardin,
    External Affairs Officer of PIE Inc., had the following to say:   \n  \n\"I should
    have known a Minmatar terrorist would be behind this theft. Only a Minmatar could
    concieve of so low an act.   \n  \nMy personal view is that we should not negotiate
    with terrorists.   \n  \nYet I also know that the medal is infinitely more valuable
    than 500 slaves (no matter how house trained).   \n  \nThe loss of this 1,500
    year old medal would in itself be a tragedy but the fact that it is awarded so
    rarely, and by the Emperor himself, gives it a symbolic value higher than any
    non-Amarr could understand.   \n  \nHamish, we will talk to you out of the necessity
    to regain the Cross but know it shall be through gritted teeth. You have earned
    our everlasting enmity Minmatar!\"   \n  \nAlthough I understand Hardin\u2019s
    response, it is hard to come to terms with the CVA\u2019s willingness to deal
    with what they consider terrorists. Opinions seem to be divided on the subject,
    even within the CVA itself. Then again, a mere five hundred slaves traded for
    the medal will benefit both parties. The slaves will be freed by the Ushra\u2019Khan,
    and Admiral Trevize regains his priceless medal."
