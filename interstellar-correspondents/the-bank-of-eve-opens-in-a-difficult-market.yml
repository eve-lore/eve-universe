    Kor-Azor** \\- The Bank Of Eve [EOBT] has opened for business, aiming to bring
    trust to New Eden where other banks have had past difficulty.  \n  \nBlastyoazz666,
    a founding member of the bank believes that it has the potential be the best in
    New Eden. He claimed that capsuleers \"always look for more ISK\", and there is
    no better way than by \"getting a loan\". He also stated that he believes EOBT
    will be successful as they have \"watched the rest fail\", and have learned from
    those mistakes by other banks.  \n  \nHe believes that to succeed they need to
    earn the trust of the capsuleers that will be banking with them and need to put
    in the work: \"We are dedicating all of our time to this idea. We have spreadsheets
    made for quick look ups on members.\"  \n  \nBlastyoazz666 further explained that
    confidence will be achieved by asking customers to \"put up collateral\" and that
    they already have some who wish to \"try us out and see how we do\".  \n  \nEOBT
    has taken four months of planning and they believe they are ready for anything,
    even when hiring, as they plan to do \"background checks\" on all new staff which
    includes talking to all their past corporations.  \n  \nWell known and trusted
    capsuleer, Chribba, gave a short statement saying that in his belief the customer
    needs to have \"trust and faith\" that the bank will take good care of their money.
    The bank would also need to communicate as failing to do so would make trust in
    the venture \"decrease\" in Chribba's opinion.  \n  \nSo far capsuleers are remaining
    skeptical, with RAW23 stating: \"You need to put in some time and effort convincing
    [capsuleers] that you can be trusted and the way to do this is to start small
    and then grow.\" Another, Phoebe Halliwell, said: \"The fact that you only have
    ten billion [ISK] between all the involved owners of the bank doesn't exactly
    inspire confidence in your ISK making abilities.\"  \n  \nAs they are now open
    for business, capsuleers may be reminded of the previous failings of EBANK and
    the current rebuilding process that they are undergoing.  \n  \nWith the bank
    preparing for its opening, capsuleers will have to decide not only if it delivers
    the trust it promises to customers, but also if it has the potential to last.\n\n###
