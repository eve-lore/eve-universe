- body: "Deklein - In the early hours of the 10th, Band of Brothers attempted to use
    its new \u2018Maximum Damage\u2019 warfare philosophy. The current residents of
    the region, Imperial Republic Of the North, stopped the juggernaut in three decisive
    battles. \n\nUnable to bring the full force of its MAX assault into Deklein due
    to cynosural jammers, BoB was forced to use conventional ships in the opening
    moves. The initial attack occurred in VFK-IV where BoB attempted to neutralize
    the system\u2019s cynosural jammer. Although evenly matched in numbers, IRON took
    the day when they deployed a locally available Avatar class Titan and fired the
    Doomsday weapon, destroying a good part of BoB\u2019s fleet. \n\nSeveral hours
    later, BoB once again attempted to take out the cynosural jammer in VFK-IV. In
    addition to the Avatar, an IRON Nyx class Mothership joined the front line battle
    providing support and fighter cover. The combined force of those two ships aided
    in destroying a majority of BoB ships with minimal losses to IRON. \n\nBoB regrouped
    and launched another attack less than two hours later on the cynosural jammer
    in neighboring 2R-CRW. Although IRON was unable to deploy their Avatar, they defeated
    the BoB fleet in conventional combat with the help of allies Red Alliance and
    Pure. \n\nOne anonymous IRON pilot had this to say about the \u2018Maximum Damage\u2019
    operation, \"It doesn't seem to have been very successful for BoB\u2026\" \n\nKrok
    elite of Red Alliance shared a similar view: \"Operation 'MAXimum Damage' changed
    to 'MAXimum PODS going home'\" \n\nSpaceSavage, a member of Executive Outcomes
    (a member of the Greater BoB Coalition) had a different opinion: \"If IRON believes
    they've stopped MAX, they are mistaken. The thing is with this sort of campaign
    is that you can\u2019t really stop it. With logistics being so easy, with the
    industrial strength, the only thing that will stop MAX is if BoB/GBC say stop.
    The most dangerous thing in [space] is a roaming entity, a fleet that has no specific
    goals other than to level part of the map, so far we've taken out fleets, taken
    high value moons, killed defenders and then killed attackers. MAX is designed
    to inflict maximum damage, thus far, it\u2019s happening. I think time will tell
    how efficient the campaign will be. I\u2019m looking forward to many fights ahead;
    I was part of the group of 400 capitals that moved up here, a sight to behold,
    now all that\u2019s left is for someone to challenge that fleet.\""
