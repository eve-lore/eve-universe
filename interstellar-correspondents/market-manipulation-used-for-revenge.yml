- body: "The vast majority of market manipulations are conducted with profit as the
    only motivation. For the past two months, Darkrftr has been waging an economic
    war on the Intrepid Crossing alliance as an act of revenge; \u201CThere is no
    way we could fight them so I am attacking their market\u201D. \n\nDarkrftr has
    made claims that Intrepid Crossing \u201Cstole\u201D 1.4 billion isk (in the form
    of an investment) to build their outpost in WU9-ZR, Etherium Reach. Shortly after
    the outpost was built, Darkrftr claims that his corporation was unceremoniously
    removed from the alliance, and no refund of the investment ever tendered. \n\nStar
    Nove, a member of Intrepid Crossing tells a different tale. According to Nove,
    Darkrftr had been conducting his manipulations long before his corporation was
    removed from the alliance. Although complaints were sent in to Darkrftr\u2019s
    superiors, Nove claims: \u201CHis corporation chose not to do anything about it
    and I believe that's why they were kicked [from the alliance]\u201D. In addition,
    Nove claims that Darkrftr \u201Calso infiltrated one of our corps, then when he
    was given hangar access, he stole from them.\u201D \n\nRegardless of the cause
    of the dispute, Darkrftr has escalated his manipulations since the separation.
    Using a jump clone still housed in D-IZT9, Darkrftr has been buying up high demand
    items, marking them up, and reselling them. \n\nOriginally willing to settle for
    a 1.4 billion isk payout to \u201Cgo away\u201D, Darkrftr has steadily increased
    his demands as Intrepid Crossing continues to ignore them. He is currently demanding
    120 billion isk to leave the area. Darkrftr admits that this number is unrealistic,
    but he does say that \u201CI would take less if I could sell off my stock before
    I left. That\u2019s a leave now price.\u201D \n\nIntrepid Crossing is not the
    only alliance in the area that has noticed the market manipulations. Dylon Xavier
    of Evolution Alliance and Clerence Thomas of Ethereal Dawn weighed in with their
    views of the situation. \n\nClerence Thomas chuckled: \u201CMostly I sell a lot
    more shuttles in bulk!...as far as I know, Intrepid Crossing mostly sells on contract,
    so it's got negligible impact on them. Most of Ethereal Dawn produces what it
    can internal to corps and imports the rest. Most of what we have on the market
    is cast off and convenience stuff... So while it does annoy a few, it's mostly
    a chuckle for us producers that sell a silly number of shuttles. Only our newest
    corps coming out here really noticed it in looking over the market.\u201D \n\nDylon
    Xavier: \u201CEvolution imports 90% of what we use, so no major impact thus far.
    I\u2019m not sure his 'impact' on the market is even really noticeable. The things
    we'd actually buy, like ships, we'd bring in on jumps. The rest is just 'convenience'
    \u2013 \u2018don't wanna fly back for missiles\u2019 kind of thing.\u201D \n\nMost
    in the area agree that the only affect Darkrftr has had is on the convenience
    of using the market system. While several scoff at his actions as \u201Cuseless
    and limited\u201D, Darkrftr has made an estimated 10-12 billion isk on his manipulations
    to date. \n\nAlthough he still claims that revenge is his goal, it appears that
    Darkrftr\u2019s manipulations are not having the intended impact; but with profits
    still coming in, there is no pressing need for Darkrftr to abandon his endeavor."
