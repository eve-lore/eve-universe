    **** such is the 'Ships of Eve' lottery's first prize that a fortunate ticketholder
    will receive during the upcoming draw. Ticket sales are still under way and there
    is time until 04:19 of 13.07.111 to reserve a number.  \n  \nThe 'Ships Of Eve'
    lottery will be held in Jita as soon as the 4000 allocated tickets are sold or
    the target date is met, although staff say that seven days of overtime sales might
    be added if uptake is low.  \n  \nIf the quota is reached, winners will be drawn
    using a random generator and the announcements will be broadcast in Jita.  \n
    \ \n[![T'Amber - Ships Of Eve Lottery Holder](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3189/tamberthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F3189%2Ftamber.png)If
    ticket sales fall short of the enterprize's targets, the lottery's staff will
    decide whether to refund all tickets or allocate prizes regardless and take the
    loss. Which they choose will not be known until nearer the time.  \n  \nT'Amber,
    who organizes the event, is a newcomer in New Eden's lottery scene. After a years-long
    research career and lot of time spent collecting ships, she decided to run a Lottery
    becouse she feels these are popular events that stand out on their own. \"I always
    thought [my collection of vessels] would be a great prize... I had been planning
    on running this lottery for a while but was missing a few ships,\" she admitted.
    \ \n  \nRunning a lottery involves a lot of organizational work and needs someone
    who can guarantee that the prizes are available and the enterprize is not a fraud.
    F90OEX, a well-known industrialist, will take the guarantor's role, acting as
    third party for the first prize and extracting winning numbers. He explained:
    \"it is [T'Amber's] first time running a lotto [and] Chribba is not involved...
    [if the lottery is succesful, it] will be quite an achivement.\"  \n  \nSome capsuleers
    have expressed concern that the lottery is being run for profit purposes: \"Is
    all that stuff... really worth the 40 billion total ticket price?\" asked Imiar
    Timshae. To address potential customers' concerns, T'Amber explained that the
    cost of Tech 3 ships and materials has fallen since the time she acquired the
    prizes; she expects to actually take a loss from this round of the lottery.  \n
    \ \nShe explained \"All the proceeds (minus advertising and fees) will be going
    into the next lottery.\" In T'Amber's view, ideal future events could include
    \"a lottery that includes all uncommon and common sub-capital and capital ships,
    and maybe even a rare or uber-rare ship!\"  \n  \nPilots hoping to enter the lottery
    are warned to be careful of one T'Amberr, who looks almost identical to the lottery
    organizer, has a similar corporation name and displays an identical public biography.
    T'Amber claims she was shocked to discover the look-alike and stated \"It's obviously
    not me. My cheeks are much fatter, although I look better in that dress.\"  \n
    \ \nThe Interstellar Correspondents will follow the lottery and report on the
    winners when they are announced.\n\n### GalNet Resources\n\n[Ships Of Eve Lottery
