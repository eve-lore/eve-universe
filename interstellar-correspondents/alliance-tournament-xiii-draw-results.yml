    can be [seen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5EZYFIIeJw). Teams that were
    unsuccessful in the random draw will have their PLEX deposit returned after 2015-06-16.\n\nThe
    four remaining places in Alliance Tournament XIII will be distributed by silent
    auction. The silent auction opens at 11:00 UTC on 2015-06-12, and closes at 11:00
    UTC 2015-06-15. To enter, you must have originally entered the random draw. You
    must then have your alliance executor send an EVE mail with the subject \"Alliance
    Tournament XIII Bid\", with the number of PLEX you wish to bid in the message,
    to the character \"CCP Logibro\". The alliance executor must also place the relevant
    number of PLEX in the redeeming system. Any bid made without the requisite number
    of PLEX being placed in the redeeming system by the close of the auction will
    be considered invalid. Winning teams will be announced on 2015-06-16. If multiple
    bids are submitted by an alliance, only the latest one before close of auction
    will be considered.\n\nAnd finally, we are pleased to announce our player commentators
    that will be joining us in the studio this year. They are:\n\n  * Sir Squeebles\n
    \ * Apothne\n  * Chessur\n  * Elise Randolph\n\n\n\nIf you have questions or just
    want to talk shop with your fellow tournament competitors, come visit the [Alliance
    Tournament Forums](https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=topics&f=264).\n\nAnd
    remember: the best ship, is championship.\n\n-[CCP Logibro](https://twitter.com/CCP_Logibro)"
