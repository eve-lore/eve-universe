    KHANID -** Early last month, pirates belonging to the Without Remorse alliance
    destroyed a freighter piloted by Tardass of Synchronized Elements of Alligned
    Lethality in Rilera during their regular hunting operation. This loss brought
    the existing internal tensions in the alliance to the breaking point.  \n  \nThe
    freighter was carrying a large amount of assorted materiel as a part of the Soldiers
    of Solitude alliance's push to low security space in their first step towards
    a null security existence. Although kill records indicate the loss as having been
    between 300 and 400 billion ISK, this number is most likely exaggerated due to
    blue print copies mistakenly estimated at blue print original costs. Despite the
    discrepancy, the pirates claim to have looted 2.5 billion ISK worth of materiel
    from the wreck.  \n  \nThe freighter loss was the last straw that caused alliance
    leader Narahn to resign from his position and leave the alliance, blaming alliance
    members as the reason for the loss. As Narahn left, so did a majority of the corporations
    in the alliance leaving the \"SOS loyalists\" unsure what to do after this big
    a blow.  \n  \nThe new leader of SOS, Guardian Delgado, says that the resignation
    of Narahn severly blindsided the alliance. Members in SOS are still determined
    to take their place in 0.0 space. About the future of SOS, Delgado is optimistic
    and claims they will have a 'revival', \"We plan to expand our ranks. We are a
    Family-Team. We plan to work like we have done just with a different tune.\" He
    says he doesn't have ill will towards Narahn despite his stormy exit from the
    alliance.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this article? Do you have
