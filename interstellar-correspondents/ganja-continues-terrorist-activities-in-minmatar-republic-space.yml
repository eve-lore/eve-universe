    Metropolis** \\- During recent weeks, G.A.N.J.A. corporation has escalated its
    terrorist campaign within Minmatar high-security space.   \n  \nAccording to G.A.N.J.A's
    CEO Kimberly Hughes, in the last two months the corporation has destroyed about
    22 ships and collected over 900 million ISK of loot.   \n  \nKimberly Hughes explained
    that the money raised is earmarked for efforts to swing the views of powerful
    political entities in their favour, and added that, in an effort to keep capsuleers
    away from Minmatar space, they will continue to attack anyone that poses a rich
    target.   \n  \nIn comparison to other criminal corporations active within the
    Minmatar Republic, G.A.N.J.A's campaign has done relatively little damage. When
    G.A.N.J.A declared the beginning of violent hostilities, many pro-Minmatar capsuleers
    commented on the [very small scale of the protests](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eveonline.com%2Fingameboard.asp%3Fa%3Dtopic%26threadID%3D1211501).
    Elsebeth Rhiannon, Electus Matari diplomat and CEO of Gradient, stated at the
    time \"More, both in isk and in tribal lives, is destroyed daily, probably _hourly_
    , by your standard pirates...\" In recent weeks, Something Rotten achieved over
    three times as many kills in a comparable timespan to G.A.N.J.A's operation. Gentlemen's
    Club reported over 100 destroyed ships, including several strategic cruisers and
    a carrier, and over 7 billion ISK in damage in one week alone.   \n  \nWhat separates
    G.A.N.J.A. from other piratical corporations is their motivation; where most criminal
    organizations seek fame and profit, G.A.N.J.A. seeks, they claim, justice and
    redemption. G.A.N.J.A.'s military effort allegedly seeks to avenge [Ammatar farmers
    killed during The Elder Invasion of YC110](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=3367&tid=2).
    In the attack, the livelihoods of many farmers were allegedly damaged and no offer
    of compensation has been tabled to date.   \n  \nG.A.N.J.A. at first staged [peaceful
    protests](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?article=3452), self-destructing
    vessels in Rens in an effort to raise awareness of their cause. When this provoked
    no official response from Minmatar Republic officials, Kimberly Hughes' corporation
    started what they term a \"[terror campaign](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?article=3527).\"
    \  \n  \nEleutherian Guard, a Gallente Federation loyalist corporation currently
    serving in the Federal Defence Union, issued a declaration of war against G.A.N.J.A,
    hoping to stop the attacks.   \n  \nSeriphyn Inhonores, Eleutherian Guard's CEO
    explained that G.A.N.J.A's erratic periods of activity made the wardec impractical.
    \"We had to focus on our military campaign with our [Federal Defence Union] allies
    in Placid regardless, so [the war declaration] was dropped unceremoniously.\"
    \  \n  \nWhile Hughes announced further escalation of G.A.N.J.A's campaign, including
    so-called \"ninja\" salvage operations, Eleutherian Guard has already declared
    G.A.N.J.A. will be eradicated, should they resurface.   \n  \nMr Inhonores concluded:
    \"Regardless of ideology and intent... attacking unarmed civilians is never an
    acceptable means to an end.\"\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Eleutherian Guard Battle
