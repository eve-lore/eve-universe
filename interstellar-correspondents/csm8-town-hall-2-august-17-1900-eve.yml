- body: 'The 8th [Council of Stellar Management](http://community.eveonline.com/community/csm/)
    (CSM8) will be holding its second Town Hall on August 17 at 1900 EVE time.  This
    is an excellent opportunity to speak with your elected representatives to CCP
    on matters that you feel are important in New Eden, particularly as they approach
    their first trip to Iceland the last week of August.  CSM8 is working in cooperation
    with EVE University and EVE Radio to provide an interactive session where you
    can listen, ask questions, learn about what the latest CSM is up to.


    The focus of this particular Town Hall will be on the Summer Summit, suggestions
    for topics for us to take to this first CSM8/CCP Summit, the recent "Reasonable
    Things" player initiative, reactions to Odyssey 1.1, and of course, general questions
    from EVE players on any topic they desire.


    The Town Hall will last for one hour.  Any interested player is invited to attend!  You
    can learn how to attend at [this thread](https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=266431)
    on the EVE Online forums.  Hope to see you there!'
