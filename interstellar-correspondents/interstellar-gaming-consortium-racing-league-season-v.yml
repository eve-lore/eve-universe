- body: "Season five of this exciting racing competition is due to start this month.
    Teams from all over New Eden enter into this prestigious event in the hopes of
    being crowned champions of the league and individual racers also have the opportunity
    to be crowned champion in their respective ship class. \n\nA season consists of
    around ten races held in different regions of the cluster, plus some exhibition
    races. This season the races are being held in The Bleak Lands, The Citadel, Derelik,
    Essence, Everyshore, Genesis, Heimatar, Kor-Azor, Molden Heath and Tash-Murkon,
    with the two exhibition races being held in Providence and Sinq Laison. The races
    are held weekly with a break every third week, so with the two exhibition races
    this season will last for seventeen weeks. \n\nSeason four consisted of over sixty
    individual racers in eleven different teams, this was the first year that racers
    were in their own custom teams and due to the success of this format, it has been
    kept for this year. \n\nWith the start of the season a week away there is still
    time for new teams to apply and sign up. \n\nEach season so far has seen an increase
    in the amount of racers entering the competition, and due to this, the corporate
    sponsorship has been steadily increasing and the prizes for winning are getting
    bigger and better. By the end of season four over 1.3billion in ISK and prizes
    had been given to the winners, and they are hoping to be able to give even more
    away this time. Even so most of the pod pilots will tell you that they do not
    race for the ISK but for the fun and rush of adrenaline that they get from the
    race itself. \n\nGyra Rho is the event organiser and designs all the tracks, including
    detours and decoys for the racers to contend with; she came up with the idea for
    the races and dedicates a lot of her time to this venture. The racers come from
    different backgrounds and have different skills that help them in the race as
    almost any tactic is allowed. Just because you can fit your ship to go faster
    than your opponents does not mean they can't get a warp disruptor or a scrambler
    locked on you and gain the few seconds they need to win. Then again they may just
    decide to destroy your ship. \n\nAs always Interstellar Correspondents will be
    on hand to give you the latest news and information from the competition, as well
    as some exclusive interviews with this year\u2019s racers."
