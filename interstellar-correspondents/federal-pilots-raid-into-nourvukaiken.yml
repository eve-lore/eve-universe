    militia, Friedrick Psitalon and his Dead Parrot Shoppe comrades led a raid into
    the Nourvukaiken system on the evening of the sixth. \n\nNourvukaiken has been
    a major staging area for the State Protectorate with easy access to Tama, an entry
    point into the contested zones. The stargate to Tama itself has been used repeatedly
    as an assembly point for State fleet ships. One such assembly was interrupted
    when Friedrick\u2019s raiders jumped into Nourvukaiken and engaged the surprised
    State pilots. \n\nA major attempt was made by the State Protectorate to repulse
    the invaders at the gate. The annihilation of that State fleet led the surviving
    pilots to rally at the local State Protectorate station for another attempt. Rather
    than allow the fleet to operate unhindered, Friedrick split his force and sent
    a long range attack group to the station. Upon arrival, the task force was denied
    action as the State pilots docked their ships en masse. Rather than waste time
    waiting for possible targets to undock, the task force returned to the main force.
    \n\nSeveral minutes later, reports came in that a large State fleet was undocking.
    Although outnumbered almost three to one, the Federal fleet took the fight directly
    to them. After inflicting several kills, Friedrick pulled the fleet back through
    Tama for the night. \n\nFriedrick\u2019s sortie netted 80 kills in the hour and
    half his fleet occupied this Caldari stronghold, and added Nourvukaiken to the
    Militia Office\u2019s \"Dangerous Systems\" list."
