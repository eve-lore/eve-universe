- body: "At roughly 12:35 on 12th of November, YC119, a Revenant super carrier was
    spotted warping to a safe spot from the Aunenen free port citadel. Soon after,
    the Revenant was scanned down and destroyed.\n\nThe Revenant is a rare vessel
    as it is a supercarrier never designed or built by any of the four major factions
    in New Eden. Capsuleers who set their sights on obtaining one would have to pit
    themselves against the True Sansha incursions that specifically target lowsec
    space and hope to pick up a blueprint copy dropped from a destroyed mothership.
    Because of this, the Revenant had become an extremely attractive ship often costing
    as much as a titan, with one recently being sold for 85-90 billion ISK. With the
    true number of those in existence remaining unknown, we believe that a total of
    only fourteen have ever been destroyed.\n\nNoticing the Revenant's movement from
    the station, Guillejejeje XDD used his Onyx to combat scan the Revenant as it
    was exiting warp. When he warped to the Revenant's location he decloaked it and
    immediately tackled it. Attempts were made to ransom the Revenant as well as an
    offer of safe passage if the pilot ejected. In a defiant move, VANO DERR, the
    Revenant pilot initiated self destruct, showing he would not be ransomed. As soon
    as the cynosural field went up, several super carriers and carriers jumped to
    the beacon and applied their formidable damage to the stricken Revenant. The Revenant
    was using a travel fit and had not even been outfitted with heavy fighters.. there
    was no possibility of escape.\n\nThe attackers suffered no losses while the Revenant
    loss was valued at around 101 billion ISK. \n\n[Revenant Killmail](https://zkillboard.com/kill/65922511/)"
