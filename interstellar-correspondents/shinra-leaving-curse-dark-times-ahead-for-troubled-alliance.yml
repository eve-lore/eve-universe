    Alliance. As Shinra is one of the first members of the Curse Alliance, some say
    one of the founding members, this comes as quite a surprise.   \n  \nChowdown,
    one of the two Shinra leaders, explained Shinra leaving as follows:   \n  \n\"Although
    we still have a lot of friends in the CA, and we are very proud of what we achieved
    as an alliance, our member base was growing tired of facing the unrelenting pressure
    of our enemies, Stain Empire, XETIC and associated friends. We honestly believed
    we could carry on fighting for the foreseeable future. However, we developed a
    lot of respect for our enemies, so we decided to leave the region and allow things
    to take their natural course.   \n  \nIt was a hard decision, as many of the members
    of the CA had put in a lot of work in building an awesome infrastructure for.
    We had made a lot of friends.\"   \n  \nChowdown later confirmed that they had
    negotiated a peace with the Stain Empire and XETIC forces and had asked them to
    extend the same courtesy to corporations wanting to leave the Curse Alliance.
    Stain and XETIC agreed, which ultimately led to this article on the GalNat channels:
    [Pax Stainorum](\u201Dhttp://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=140355\u201D),
    an offer of peace to the remaining Curse Alliance members.   \n  \nHowever, Shinra
    leaving is not the only problem that the Curse Alliance faces. Three major corporations
    have left in the past week, Vengeance of the Fallen, long-standing member of the
    Curse Alliance, Supremacy and RONA-KIA, ex-Phoenix Alliance member.   \n  \nPolitical
    analysts have already drawn parallels between the current situation in Curse and
    what happened to the Phoenix Alliance. As one might recall, several corporations
    left the Phoenix Alliance a while ago, resulting in the Alliance\u2019s drastic
    reduction in power. Although it is too early to tell, a similar thing might happen
    to Curse, although they still have well over two-thousand members. It will be
    interesting to see what happens exactly to this contested region of space, although
    Curse has plenty of dedicated members that are there to stay until the end.   \n
    \ \nRumors abound, though, regarding Shinra, and possible other ex-Curse or soon-to-be
    ex-Curse corporations\u2019, next steps. It has been hinted at in various places
    that they are considering paying not-so-friendly visits to former acquaintances
    as well as a persistent rumor that a new alliance might crop up somewhere around
    the Great Wildlands. An alliance allied to Stain and XETIC in the region could
    bring some much needed stability, or bring even more chaos to the region."
