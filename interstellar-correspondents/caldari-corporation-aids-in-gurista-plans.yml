- body: "NONNI \u2013 Pilots in Lonetrek were left bemused last Monday by a shotgun
    trade between Obuchi Kun, a known Gurista operative and Auluras Reikatoh, the
    CEO of Igneus Civitas. The Gurista operative fled after the trade was completed
    before Caldari law enforcement could arrive on the scene. \n\nCaldari officials
    and a squad of marines were mere minutes away from apprehending Kun, who they
    believe has been working for over five months on a secret project for the Guristas.
    \n\nHowever, Kun slipped away to destinations unknown whilst Reikatoh was led
    away for questioning. The unfortunate industrialist had suffered various threats
    to his family and personal wellbeing, as well as an assortment of bribes as his
    paymasters closed in on their purchases. \n\nThe list of items was not easy to
    acquire and the Igneus Civitas Corporation had to rely on the generosity of a
    plethora of capsuleers to assist them in their search. The items included 100,000
    units of Electronic Parts and Coolant, an undisclosed amount of Plutonium and
    a large quantity of data chips and mechanical parts. \n\nNaturally the events
    stirred the collective curiosity of the pod-pilot community and one brave soul,
    Vickers, the CEO of Mentally Unstable Enterprises was ready to back his words
    up. \n\n\"Leave here Gurista scum,\" said Vickers. \"Or fall before me like so
    many of your brethren have before!\" \n\nPerhaps it was this threat or the rapidly
    approaching marines that saw Kun decide that discretion was the better part of
    valour and slip into the murky backworlds of Lonetrek. \n\nReikatoh, clearly traumatised
    by the whole ordeal told witnesses: \"I don't want anything more to do with Guristas.\"
    \n\nSpeculation has spread amongst pod-pilots following last week's announcement
    that the Angels required a similar shopping list in the South. Exactly what the
    Guristas' plans are or indeed who they intend enacting them against remains a
    mystery at the present time."
