    of Applied Knowledge has crowned its victor. \n\nA staggering 172 teams entered
    the competition. The numbers were whittled down after many rounds of intense team
    battles that were conducted at the purpose built arenas in Autaris. \n\nThose
    teams that made it as far as the final four were guaranteed to walk away with
    at least 250 million ISK. Worthy of note is the corporation Duty. who managed
    to get two teams into the final four. \n\nThe matches to earn a place in the final
    were hard fought. Booking their places were Amon Nagira and d dark who beat Kuzya
    Morozov and Cautet, and Birkir and Ciprian who defeated Jude Kopenhagen and Vanden.
    \n\nThe final was set, Nagira and dark fielded a Vexor and Rupture whilst Birkir
    and Ciprian favoured an Arbitrator duo. \n\n\"In the highly-anticipated final
    match, Birkir and Ciprian defeat Amon Nagira and d dark in six minutes and thirty
    seconds. A thoroughly-exceptional match of two very proven teams ... but the pair
    of Arbis once again proved uncatchable. 750 million ISK rewarded to Amon and dark,
    and the grand prize of 2 billion ISK to the phenomenal duo of Cip and Birk - our
    2008 cruiser tournament champions\" declared Master of Ceremonies el caido. \n\nWith
    the champions crowned, planning will shortly begin on the next SAK Events tournament
    taking place later this year. \n\nCapuleers are invited to monitor their GalNet
    pages for further information when available. \n\n_Internal GalNet References_
