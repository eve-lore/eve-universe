    \ \n  \nThe alliance has decided to vacate Geminate after a sustained attack from
    combined forces including ATLAS, Cult of War, Gentleman's Club, Red Alliance and
    Solar Fleet for control of the region. The defending forces were mostly comprised
    of Wildly Inappropriate, Razor, Majesta Empire and R.A.G.E.  \n  \nAccording to
    Nikodiemus of Wildly Inappropriate, the decision came when the defending forces
    realized they were too greatly outnumbered: \"[Wildly Inappropriate had] to make
    a choice: either stand ground with [Razor] and weaken the [Northern Coalition]
    in general... or re-deploy.\"  \n  \nNikodiemus also added that the move will
    reinforce the Northern Coalition's ranks: \"[Wildly Inappropriate] has re-deployed
    and is going to start putting the hurt on the [Northern Coalition's] enemies...
    I am very much looking forward to what the future holds for us,\" he stated.  \n
    \ \nBobby Atlas, explained the reasons behind the invasion: \"[it] was close to
    our home, had abundance of people we could attack close-by and was logistically
    the most viable location for a mobile campaign,\" he said.  \n  \nAccording to
    Bobby Atlas, fights were abundant at first but they dried up as the war progressed:
    \"[Razor] took the position of only defending against [sovereignty] contests and
    high-end attacks, as such we were forced to engage in a [sovereignty] war... [that]
    stretched the lines of [the northern coalition].\"  \n  \nThe sudden move out
    of Geminate has put Wildly Inappropriate's member corporations under stress. Vaporize,
    a member of a corporation who recently left the alliance, explains that some of
    the most productive corporations in Wildly Inappropriate are leaving: \"GLD, Eye
    of God and Freee already left... [as] for us, we love [Wildly Inappropriate] but
    the current direction of the alliance does not take advantage of our corp's capabilites,\"
    he said.  \n  \nWildly Inappropriate's forces have already been spotted in ROIR-Y,
    a strategic system for the Northern Coalition. Tomcat, leader of the alliance,
    has expressed his confidence in a bright future: \"People may think we've been
    beating down and taken out of the fight but they are wrong. We are here, we will
    fight and we will win.\"\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this article?
