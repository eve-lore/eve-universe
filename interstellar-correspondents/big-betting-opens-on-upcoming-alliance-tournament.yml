    host betting on the Alliance Tournament. This will mark the third time BIG has
    arranged betting for the event recognized by many as one of the most exciting
    in New Eden.\n\nGambling on the Tournament is a major venture: during the last
    three years BIG's initiative has seen a growing influx in bets, going from six
    billion isk spent in 2007 to 10 billion in 2008; while the total number of bets
    has doubled from 328 to 733.\n\nNew Eden's citizens bet for fun and profit. Crinsom,
    a pod pilot who has gambled on the Alliance Tournament in the past, commented:
    \" _it adds a bit of spice to the tourney ... I generally bet 50,000 isk ... but
    I know people that bet near 10 million_ \". BIG's own post-event figures confirm
    those numbers, with the average bet during the 2008 tournament hovering around
    the 13 million isk mark.\n\nThe outcome of the Alliance Tournament, slated to
    begin on January 24th, has never been so uncertain. BIG Corporation will be hoping
    that this will fuel bets, and ignite further intrigue around the event, helping
    them to gain a consecutive record breaking year for BIG Betting.\n\n**GalNet Resources**\n\n[BIG
