    - Recent events have escalated to a full scale conflict and whilst preliminary
    reports from the HZFJ-M solar system are still fragmented, they depict a fight
    of epic proportions with several capital losses and more than 800 pilots involved.
    \ \n  \n[![Capital Fleet Hit By a DoomsDay](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3108/capddthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F3108%2Fcapdd.png)
    A capital fleet of at least 350 ships from Against All Autorities [AAA], Ushra
    Khan, Aggression [AGGRO] and Atlas Alliance have clashed against a similar sized
    force sporting (among the others) members of Red Alliance, Pandemic Legion [PL],
    Legion of xXDEATHXx [XIX], scorched earth, Tau Ceti and Goonswarm.  \n  \nAtlas
    and allies were trying to kill a starbase that was due out from reinforced mode.
    Blazin Hazin of Atlas Alliance recalls the moment the hell break loose: \" _[we]
    went on the [starbase] with our capital fleet. [PL] came in with their dreads
    at snipe range on us, [XIX] came in close range. As [PL] came in, we jumped in
    [AAA] capitals on them close range \u2026 we won capital fight, but all Atlas
    support and [AGGRO] died_\".  \n  \nAs for the defending side, Critical Sniper
    of Red Alliance gave his view on the fight: \" _The fight started when we jumped
    in - via titan - on Atlas' Caps. I guess then [XIX] and [PL] came with dreads
    and we got counter hot drop by [AAA] \u2026 [They] had about 100 Capitals, maybe
    more, our side had 60 or maybe less\"._   \nSniper went on adding _: \"_ _We held
    the field in the end but cap fight was lost \u2026 they destroyed 2 towers \u2026
    but [new ones] are already stationed in the place._\"  \n  \n[![Dreads Open Fire
    on Starbase](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3108/sbfirethumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F3108%2Fsbfire.png)Atlas
    considers the battle a win, as Blazing puts it: \"[ _we] had 90 capitals on field,
    70 made it out and some [warped to safe distance] \u2026 we lost perhaps 10 capitals
    or so, AAA lost 20 [and] I am looking at 55 hostile dread wrecks \u2026 [plus]
    we killed 2 towers_\".   \n  \nXIX and Allies, however, are sure the fight was
    not a definitive win for Atlas. El'rac of Scorched Earth explains: \" _This was
    a major push to support our allies in Detorid and stop Atlas push to take high
    end moons in the area \u2026 [The] Fight was a success, our allies held the field._\"
    \ \n  \nDetorid War is now escalating to the size of a inter-regional Conflict,
    but It is still too soon to guess whether this is going to be a long attrition
    war or rather a quick blitzkriege scenario.  \n  \nFurther updates will be published
    as soon as reports will became available.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the
