- body: "The **Fifth Alliance Tournament** is almost upon us. This year\u2019s entrants
    include a number of new, smaller and mostly unknown alliances as well as the established
    tournament veterans. \n\nNext in our series of Alliance introductions, we present
    _**When Fat Kids Attack** and **The Kadeshi**_. \n\n**When Fat Kids Attack (FATTY)**\n\n*
    * *\n\nFounded only two months ago, When Fat Kids Attack is comprised of five
    corporations and about 104 members. Flumz, CEO of x13 tells us that \u201CFATTY\u201D
    is an empire based alliance located in the southern Devoid and Derelik regions
    that enjoys waging war on local corporations and occasionally hunting targets
    of opportunity in the Providence region. \n\nThe alliance heads felt that the
    tournament would be a great challenge and a good learning experience for this
    young alliance. Flumz tells us that the fame of winning the tournament might be
    useful if FATTY decided to step up recruitment and possibly become a full time
    mercenary alliance. \n\n**The Kadeshi (THOR)**\n\n* * *\n\nFounded early this
    year, The Kadeshi is currently comprised of two corporations and 41 members. Hortoken
    Wolfbrother, a director/executor in the alliance tells us that The Kadeshi are
    a nomadic alliance that focuses heavily on frontier exploration and \u201Cthe
    procurement of massive amounts of isk\u201D. \n\nHortoken feels that winning the
    tournament will give The Kadeshi bragging rights as the premier combat alliance
    in New Eden; \u201CWe get to claim we\u2019re the best in New Eden. How is that
    not awesome?\u201D The Kadeshi team is prepared for combat, and Hortoken hints
    that corporate espionage may play a part in one or more of his matches. \n\n*
    * *\n\n_More coverage will be available live during the tournament. When Fat Kids
    Attack will have its first fight on Day 2 of the tournament against The Star Fraction.
    The Kadeshi will be engaging Blood Blind on Day 1 of the tournament._"
