    Drinks Incorporated\u2019s lucrative supply contract.   \n  \nThe third delivery
    out of four was transported to GDI\u2019s headquarters in the Yulai solar system
    by \u201CA GOD\u201D and \u201CBrecher\u201D; the capsuleer pilots who had won
    the supply contract.   \n  \nAs their contract nears its end with the final supply

    at the reward promised to them for delivering the shipments on time.   \n  \nAt
    this time, Gallente Drinks Inc CEO \u2013 Jetson Bills is remaining silent as
    to what award the capsuleers may receive for their diligent work."
