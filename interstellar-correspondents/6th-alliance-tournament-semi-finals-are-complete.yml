- body: "Semi Finals are complete and **R.U.R.** will face **Pandemic Legion** in
    the Finals to be held at 21:30.  \n  \nSemi Finalists made a good showing with
    **R.U.R.** claiming a victory in a hard fought match against **G00DFELLAS**. Both
    teams starting the match on the beacon cost G00DFELLAS one of their Nighthawks
    as it was quickly primaried and destroyed. A boundary violation by another Nighthawk
    may have tipped the balance towards R.U.R.  \n  \nIn the **Ev0ke** vs. **Pandemic
    Legion** match, Ev0ke's decision to take out the Pandemic Legion Claymore first
    rather than begin working on the Vexor Navy Issues cost them the match as the
    Ev0ke team could not keep up with the damage dealt to them by the Vexor drones
    and blasters.\n\nMatch reports can be found [here](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=981389)."
