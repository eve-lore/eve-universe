- body: "**G-5EN2, Providence** \\- It has been over a year since the last Celtic
    Anarchy fleet roamed the skies of New Eden. In recent weeks, however, the former
    corporations of Anarchy Empire have celebrated their old comrades' return with
    fast raiding gangs striking in Minmatar hit-and-run style. One such gang headed
    to Providence to set a trap for old foes Curatores Veritas Alliance (more commonly
    known as CVA).\n\nSky Fox of Celtic Anarchy [K.O.S] spoke about the corporation's
    return:\n\n\"The glorious workers and peasants of Celtic Anarchy will continue
    to work closely with our [former] comrades in arms if the situation presents itself,
    but for now we will not be joining any formal alliances. [The possibility of]
    rebuilding the Force of Evil alliance is something that is always under discussion
    though.\"\n\n[![Celtic Anarchy celebrate their return](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2619/imagethumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F2619%2Fimage.png)\n\n\"The
    bourgeoisie imperialistic CVA gave us some fights, giving our pilots the chance
    to warm up ready for active duty. Suffice to say, we will honor them again with
    our presence.\"\n\nWhile there may be no formal alliance at present, K.O.S's old
    ties with the member corporations of Warp to Desktop alliance were evident in
    their Providence raid.\n\nPilot Nessaji of CVA was part of the force that attempted
    to intercept the pirate raid. He describes himself as a humble \"grunt\" in the
    alliance.\n\n\"It first began with a Celtic Anarchy gang of 5-8 - I'm not sure
    exactly what the number was - battleship heavy fleet coming into Providence from
    Kari.\n\n\"From my grunt perspective, the fight itself was not that interesting.
    What made this special was the succesful trap [they laid, that] CVA stepped into.\n\n\"We
    first got news of them in Y-MPWL. They moved straight through that pipe to station
    system H6-CX8, and CVA began to assemble a response fleet. We didn't manage to
    get the fleet up fast enough to intercept them in the jump in to 9UY4-H, but our
    scouts picked them moving towards the Assah exit of Providence. We used the benefit
    of [being a] space-holding alliance and jumpbridged in front of them in hopes
    of ambushing them before they went back to empire space.\n\n\"From what [Celtic
    Anarchy reported](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmyeve.eve-online.com%2Fingameboard.asp%3Fa%3Dtopic%26threadID%3D932778%26page%3D1%231),
    their allies from Warp to Desktop alliance were 2 jumps out of G-5EN2. So Celtic
    Anarchy jumped into our camp in G-5EN2 from 9-F0B2 (I think) and I think at that
    time Warp to Desktop started moving towards G-5EN2.\n\n\"The Celtic Anarchy gang
    jumped back into 9-F0B2 once, then back into G-5EN2, obviously [in retrospect]
    buying time for their allies to arrive.\n\n\"The second time they jumped in, local
    spiked as Warp to Desktop [jumped in], but since we didn't have them scouted we
    had no idea that they would be as battleship heavy as they were. We were in our
    own interdictor bubble on the 9-FOB2 gate and our FC made the call to stay and
    fight.\n\n\"According to our combat logs, CVA had 23 pilots and Celtic Anacrhy
    and Warp To Desktop had 32 between them. These numbers are only what our killboard
    shows; I don't know if there were any CVA allies on the gate during the fight
    and because we killed so few of them, it's possible (and likely) that there were
    friendlies I cannot see on the logs.\n\n\"It seems we downed two Dominix-class
    battleships, a Falcon and a tech 1 frigate before we realised their remote repair
    capabilities were too strong for our lighter, and numerically smaller fleet. By
    that time, we had lost most of our own battleships - 7, and 7 support (battlecruisers,
    heavy assault cruisers etc).\n\n\"The FC made the call to retreat. We pulled back
    to 9UY4-H to reship to heavier Vessels, but the raiding fleet had moved to Assah
    immediately, and didn't even clear the field. Their trap was sprung and they'd
    got what they wanted, I guess.\n\n\"I believe they knew from our reputation that
    we form big fleets quite fast and they didn't want to wait to get overrun. Also,
    from what I recall, Severance had a reinforcement fleet on the move to G-5EN2,
    but they didn't get there before the fight was over.\n\n\"In the end it was a
    good show from Celtic Anarchy and Warp to Desktop of how to trap territorial alliances
    that use jumpbridges to fend off hostiles. They knew that we could cut them off
    in G-5EN2 and had allies ready.\"\n\n \n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events
