    reset Aggression's [AGGRO] standings prompting the alliance to vacate the region.
    \ \n  \nThis surprising development came after a tense meeting between Aggression
    and Atlas leadership during which Atlas' CEO was asked about rumors indicating
    Immensea was being \"sold\" to Triumvirate Alliance. Atlas' CEO left the talks
    abruptly and reset [AGGRO]'s standings.[![bobby atlas - Atlas CEO](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3187/bobbyatlasthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F3187%2Fbobbyatlas.png)
    \ \n  \n5n4keyes of Aggression, was convinced that Atlas ultimately wanted them
    to be their \"pets\" but \"[we are] not like that... we decide what we want to
    do\".  \n  \nKinizsi of Atlas stated that \"[AGGRO] leadership thought we want
    to give the region to [Triumvirate] and started offensive talks... so we [did
    reset] Aggro to teach them some manners.\"  \n  \nFollowing the standing reset,
    Aggression's leadership ordered its capsuleers to immediately vacate Immensea.
    However, as result of the confused political situation, retreat is being carried
    out in a haphazard fashion as Bob Tslob of Aggression describes: \"the alliance
    already lost 2 jump freighters to disorganization and Pandemic Legion [is] watching
    our logistics routes.\" Kinizsi confirms that Aggression has lost several cargo
    ships and adds: \"[we will] try to kill as much as possible to make [it hard for
    them].\"  \n  \nGho Higyidr, an Aggression capsuleer, says the evacuation is made
    even more difficult by offlined jumpbridges. Several outposts in Immensea are
    reportedly being camped by capsuleers from Scorched Earth, Libertas Fidelitas,
    Against ALL Authorities, Atlas and Blade. Most empire escape routes are camped
    as well.  \n  \n[![5n4keyes - Former AGGRO. 2nd-in-Command](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3187/5n4keyes2thumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F3187%2F5n4keyes2.png)As
    a result of the harassment of logistics routes, Aggression's pilots are having
    some close calls. Gho Higydr tells of a jump freighter that was tackled and held
    long enough to be brought into structure. She says: \"It was rescued by [two]
    carriers... who were there able to [remotely repair] it in time. The attackers
    got away but the assets were saved.\"  \n  \nEven as Aggression is evacuating
    assets from Immensea, Ushra'khan appears to have immediately begun a push into
    the I-NGI8 pocket.   \n  \nKerth Gensen of Ushra'Khan tells us that the I-NGI8
    station was taken to accomplish both educational and strategic purposes as new
    pilots were included on the assault to \"teach\" them about station conquest.
    Although they have seized the I-NGI8 station, Ushra'Khan may not decide to hold
    space in the region. Kerth explains: \"if a station [turns out] to be a military
    asset, then I'll not simply throw it away... neither would I take on a ridiculous
    cost for no strategic benefit.\"  \n  \nBobby Atlas and White Aero of Atlas Alliance
    have not responded to requests for information at this time.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you
