    Genesis** \\- A very rare Mimir Minmatar cruiser was awarded as first prize in
    the Ships of Eve \"Domination\" frigate tournament to Kalnov of Problematique
    Inc. 66 contestants competed in groups over a number of weeks, culminating in
    a battle in rookie ships on 23.01.112.   \n  \nThe 66 contestants were selected
    by a variety of methods - either by registering for the event, being chosen at
    random from among those in the \"Ships of Eve Events\" channel at a designated
    time, or by winning a special \"Beta\" prize draw for Ships of Eve 4 lottery ticket
    holders. Twelve pilots from all across New Eden travelled to Tarta to compete
    in the final round.  \n  \n[![a punisher and a merlin in close combat](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3690/combatthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3690/combat.png)Initially,
    the tournament's schedule was delayed by management issues and uncontrollable
    environmental conditions in the combat area. Capsuleer entrants spent some time
    in-station before they could join the fight; one capsuleer quipped \"There's [still]
    some passed-out slave girls in my cargo hold,\" before entering the arena.   \n
    \ \nThe Mimir, a limited-edition vessel awarded to Alliance Tournament VII's victors,
    is rare and extremely valuable. Not surprisingly, many pilots made agreements
    and alliances with other contestants before heading into the fight.   \n  \n\"I
    was primaried, I'm sure!\" Heinky commented when he was eliminated from the contest.
    He also observed that tournament's referee let people warp into the arena after
    the fight had begun, which he felt gave them an advantage.   \n  \nAfter roughly
    20 minutes of battle, 9 of the 12 final round participants had seen their shiny
    frigates converted into smoking clumps of metal scrap, but time constraints forced
    T'amber to call a halt to the match. The tournament was suspended and the remaining
    capsuleers were asked to report back on 06.02.112 for a second round.   \n  \nOn
    the last day of tournament, the surviving pilots were asked to compete using rookie
    frigates: the Impairor, Reaper, Ibis or Velator.   \n  \nCap Tyrian, who lost
    his ship first, describes the match: \"Kalnov [fielded] a big tank, Asquirrel
    had a [microwarpdrive] ranged Ibis. My final setup was a Velator with two 125mm
    rails, a damp and a signal amplifier. I didn't reach the field first and Asquirrel
    had his drone out already; that single Hobgoblin II was the only thing that...
    killed me.\"   \n  \nThe tournament was ultimately won by Kalnov. \"ASquirrel's
    drone killed [Cap Tyrian] by itself. Then ASquirrel was in target range, so my
    augmented hobgoblins tore him apart,\" he explained.   \n  \nAccording to Kalnov,
    F90OEX has already offered to rebuy his Mimir prize for a staggering 12 billion
    ISK, but Kalnov prefered to keep the ship, stating \"I'll probably move it to
    [Jita 4-4]... I want to fly it, but it has to stay safe from suicide ganking.\"\n\n###
