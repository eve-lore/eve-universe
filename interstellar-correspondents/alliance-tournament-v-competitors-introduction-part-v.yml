- body: "The **Fifth Alliance Tournament** is almost upon us. This year\u2019s entrants
    include a number of new, smaller and mostly unknown alliances as well as the established
    tournament veterans. \n\nNext in our series of Alliance introductions, we present
    _**The Red Skull** and **Green Alliance**_. \n\n**The Red Skull**\n\n* * *\n\nAlthough
    The Red Skull has been around for the better part of a year and a half, it has
    seen a number of executor corporations. The latest executor is Woopatang. Xornicon
    Altair, a director of Woopatang as well as Communications Officer for the alliance,
    tells us that The Red Skull is primarily a combat oriented alliance that currently
    holds a small constellation in Syndicate. Since taking over the executorship of
    Red Skull, Xornicon believes that Woopatang has brought the alliance to a position
    that makes them \u201Cable to stand against the best, and worst, this galaxy has
    to offer\u201D. \n\nA minor clerical issue concerning who actually paid the entry
    fee caused some confusion and rumors that Red Skull had withdrawn from the tournament.
    The issue has been resolved and Red Skull will be participating.* \n\nThe publicity
    of winning the tournament may help boost Red Skull\u2019s membership, but Xornicon
    is confident that winning or losing will have no effect on Red Skull\u2019s future
    plans. \n\n_*Recent reports from GalNet indicate that Red Skull may now be attempting
    to sell their tournament slot. A purchased tournament slot will not be honored
    by the Commission and as of this writing, Red Skull has not formerly withdrawn
    from the tournament._\n\n_**Update** \\- due to the uncertainty regarding TRS
    participation, organisers have now withdrawn them from the tournament._\n\n**Green
    Alliance**\n\n* * *\n\nFounded just over a month and a half ago, Green Alliance
    is one of the smallest alliances in the tournament at just two corporations and
    39 members. Ooke, Alliance Fleet Admiral of Green Alliance tells us that they
    are based out of Konora and have laid claim to the Insmother and Cache regions
    (both of which sovereignty indicators show to be under the control of Red Alliance.)
    \n\nGreen Alliance is looking forward to exciting matches, with fame and prizes
    as added attractions. Ooke made a point of telling us that any increase in membership
    or resources gained as a result of winning the tournament will go directly into
    the continued harassment of Red Alliance members. \n\n* * *\n\n_More coverage
    will be available live during the tournament. The Red Skull will be engaging United
    Legion on Day One of the tournament. Green Alliance will face SMASH Alliance on
    the same day._"
