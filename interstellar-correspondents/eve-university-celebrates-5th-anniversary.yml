    to aid and train young pod pilots. With recruiters always on the lookout for New
    Eden's bright young pilots, EVE University prides itself on providing these pilots
    with the tools they need to have long, successful futures, wherever they may end
    up after completing their training.\n\n![EVE University](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2934/e-uni.png)
    While some corporations accept only hand selected pilots by invitation only or
    require a certain amount of experience, E-UNI happily considers all submitted
    applications. Speaking with Director of Operations, Kelduum Revaan, it quickly
    becomes clear that few are turned away. \"...there's no real requirements.\" He
    states, \"...assuming they follow our policies, which are basically that they
    don't cause any trouble, and respect the other pilots in [New Eden], they are
    welcomed.\" When asked about the level of camaraderie among the pilots Mr. Revaan
    explains, \"...the level of community spirit we have is excellent though - more
    than I have seen in any other corporation.\"\n\nGraduating from E-UNI is an individual
    process, dictated by the amount of knowledge the pilot enters with, and what they
    are there to learn. Some pilots finish the required program within three months
    or so, while others stay years. When asked about the minimum amount of time it
    takes to graduate, Director of Training Dierdra Vaal replies, \"After 3 months,
    they tend to be able to make a good living in [New Eden] and they know what the
    [universe] has to offer and where they want to go.\"\n\nHowever, while 3 months
    is the minimum amount of time it takes to graduate, there is no set time limit
    imposed after that. Since the curriculum is completed at an individual pace, pilots
    may attend up to twenty hours of instruction per week at their convenience. Ms.
    Vaal explains, \"Some weeks have more events than others...but [yes] we can have
    a lot of stuff scheduled such as classes (tackling 101, mining 101, etc), events
    (frigate free for all tournaments, etc) and low [security space] fleet ops.\"
    Pilots are also given the advantage of being able to listen to such notable guest
    speakers as Darius JOHNSON, CEO of GoonFleet; LaVista Vista, CEO of Conservative
    Shenanigans Party; and Verone, CEO and Founder of VETO.\n\nSince the majority
    of the pilots who enter E-UNI are extremely new, they are welcome to stay as long
    as they need to develop the skills to be successful. Once they are ready to leave,
    Mr. Revaan tells us that the University encourages them to make their own choice
    where to go from there. \"Our members are then free to make to choose where they
    want to go - nobody is favored, which makes things much simpler to manage.\" When
    asked about the opportunities that graduates have with other corporations, he
    states, \"There are quite a few corporations who prefer E-UNI pilots over non
    [E-UNI] pilots.\"\n\nFor the success over the last five years, E-UNI acknowledges,
    and thanks, the players, corporations and alliances who have supported them. He
    also recognizes the tireless efforts of the instructors who volunteer their time
    to train the students. When asked about the future of EVE University, Mr. Revaan
    says, \"The directorship might change, but the vision of our CEO has driven the
    University for the past five years, and will continue to do so for the next five
    years...and beyond.\" He concludes, \"As long as the stars are still burning,
    EVE Unversity will still be here.\"\n\nFor recruitment information, please set
