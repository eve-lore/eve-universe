- body: "It has been less than two weeks since the formation of the Federal Defence
    Union militia and infighting between corporations has already begun. An incident
    earlier in the week has led to Phoenix Tribe declaring war on Pillowsoft; they
    are now actively pursuing and attacking their fellow militia members. \n\nDuring
    a fleet operation headed by Elijah Ghost, a member of Phoenix Tribe and a member
    of Pillowsoft accused each other of looting wrecks at a combat site; the argument
    turned ugly when the two antagonists began shooting each other. The fight that
    ensued resulted in the Phoenix Tribe pilot losing his ship, and demanding recompense
    for his loss. When his demands were not met, Phoenix Tribe initiated a war declaration
    on Pillowsoft. \n\nThe effect of this war declaration is already causing hardships
    in the militia; separate fleets need to be formed to keep the corporations apart
    during operations, and fleet members find it difficult to concentrate on fighting
    the Caldari when they have to worry about fellow militia members attacking them.
    During the assembly of a large fleet in Villore, Fleet Commander Elijah Ghost
    (a member of Pillowsoft) was ambushed and killed. This single action delayed the
    deployment of the fleet for quite some time until Elijah was able to return. \n\nWhen
    asked if he was concerned about the trouble the war declaration was bringing the
    militia, the Phoenix Tribe member responded: \u201CNot really.\u201D \n\nUnless
    we stop this infighting, the Caldari will wipe us away as we fragment. We must
    work together to destroy the State!"
