    \ by ISD Ashen Talinthe\n\nNew Eden Radio are hosting a betting pool for Alliance
    Tournament X. Capsuleers will be able to enter for a fee of 50 million ISK and
    will be able to place bets on up to 8 of their favourite alliances competing in
    the tournament.\n\nWinners will be determined by points. As their chosen alliances
    advance in the tournament, they will be awarded a certain number of points based
    on their chosen alliances placements. Prizes so far are in excess of 2.6 billion
    isk and this number will increase as bets are placed. On offer as well, is 3 Plex
    for first place, 2 for second, and 1 for third.\n\nResponse from the community
    at large has so far been generally optimistic. We spoke to a group of capsuleers
    in Jita that thought the betting pool was a good thing as long as it was fair
    and regulated. One capsuleer in Jita told us that although \"there are already
    tons of places to bet money\" capsuleers can be confident in knowing New Eden
    Radio's will be \"kept fair\".\n\nNew Eden Radio has hosted several lotteries
    and raffles in the past including the New Years fireworks show where over 4 billion
    ISK worth of tickets were sold. According to Daggaroth, from New Eden Radio, this
    is the first actual betting pool they have hosted and revealed that there may
    be more to come: \"If we get a lot of good feedback... we will most certainly
    continue betting pools for the future.\"\n\n###  GalNet References\n\n[Information
