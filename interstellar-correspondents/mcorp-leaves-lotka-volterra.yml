- body: "Velios, CEO of M.Corp and former executor corporation of the Lotka Volterra
    (LV) alliance has released a statement announcing their withdrawal from LV due
    to the war's toll on M.Corp. \n\nLotka Volterra's history stretches back 15 months
    ago when M.Corp, along with the corporations Shinra and UKC, carved out a slice
    of space in the Tenerifis region after a short but fierce engagement with Red
    Alliance, the two entities sharing significant Eve history with one another. \n\nTheir
    initial plans were to build an empire. Build they did, claiming many systems and
    constructing stations that still exist to this day, with a strong market in the
    constellations and systems they claimed. However, they faced a resolute enemy
    in the form of RA and were never able to completely vanquish their nemesis. A
    fact that returned to haunt them with the arrival of reinforcements in the guise
    of Goonswarm. \n\nVelios stated: \"It could be said that we created such a magnificent
    domain, that it drew envious eyes in our direction. All too quickly it seems,
    Lotka Volterra became the focus of a wider movement to knock back the establishments
    of power.\" \n\nHe added: \"The undeniable truth is that against such numbers
    of committed pilots in the Coalition, we were doomed.\" \n\nHowever, Velios has
    no hard feelings about this, and is quick to wish \"...the new occupiers of the
    south eastern frontier luck in the future. May they enjoy the area to its fullest
    extent as we have done.\" \n\nHaving since created the alliance M.Pire, the future
    of M.Corp is still not set in stone. Velios concluded: \"Of course we do have
    plans for the future. M.Corp is too long in the tooth simply to recede into Empire
    anonymity! We intend that our name shall be remembered for all of the right reasons.
    We will grow, we will improve and we will repay debts of gratitude to our friends,
    and debts of vengeance to our enemies!\""
