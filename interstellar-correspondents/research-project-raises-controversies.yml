- body: "THE FORGE. Stirring once again the otherwise calm Caldari FTL comm channel,
    researchers required pod-pilots' logistic assistance.   \n  \nAs reported [earlier
    this week](http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=931&tid=6), Mr. Vance
    and Mr. Stats are purchasing a few thousand units of Electronic Parts offering
    to pay roughly 40% above average market values.   \n  \nSuch good is legal and
    traded in vast amounts inside the Caldari State, yet their claims that the parts
    are to be used in an undisclosed \u201Cresearch project [that] is for [the] benefit
    of all of eve and not for destructive purposes\u201D is meeting increasing hostility
    from an important number of Caldari citizens.   \n  \nGalNet has been full of
    [controversy and guess work](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=234091)
    about this project. Although there is no official confirmation so far, many pod-pilots
    have assumed this research effort is a \u201CCrielere II\u201D of sorts.   \n
    \ \nThe fact that Mr. Stats is of the Intaki bloodline muddles the issue even
    further. Caldari pilots opposing any sort of cooperation with the Gallente Federation
    are voicing their concern, some of them even confusing Mr. Stats\u2019 bloodline
    with his citizenship. Others have supported his efforts believing it is in the
    State\u2019s best interests to pursue good relations with the Intaki.   \n  \n[State
    factionalism](http://www.eve-online.com/background/potw/03-dec-01.asp) is also
    starring in this dawning scandal. The research facility is located in a Josameto
    station belonging to the Sukuuvestaa Corporation, well-know leader of the Practical
    Caldari faction. Although there is no proof as of yet of any connection between
    either Mr. Vance and/or Mr. Stats with SuVee, quite a few Citizens of opposed
    factions have already taken a defensive stance.   \n  \n\u201CLoyal Caldari [citizens
    should distrust] anything that wears the stench of the Practicals,\u201D stated
    Patriot-leaning CAIN Commander Officer Dev Larren. \u201CIntegrity and honor is
    not their strong point and should they ever lead the direction of the State then
    all Caldari are doomed.\u201D   \n  \nSuVee executives have remained silent to
    these allegations."
