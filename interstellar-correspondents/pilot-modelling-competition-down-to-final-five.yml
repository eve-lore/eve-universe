    were also judged on their answers to the question \"Why do you want to be top?\"
    and encouraged to \"Be creative, be harsh, be daring, play dirty and bring us
    your best shot!\" in their replies.   \n  \nThe final five models competing for
    the 2 billion ISK in prizes are: Killer Gandry of Red Horizon; former co-CEO of
    the Guiding Hand Social Club, Istvaan Shogaatsu (now a member of Rogue Drone Systems);
