    \\- Atlas Alliance has launched a surprise attack on the Region, diplomatic sources
    confirmed. At the time of writing, clashes are concentrated around DG-8VJ, 77S8-E
    and HZFG-M solar systems.  \n  \n[![Atlas Diplo: Banlish](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3107/atlasdiplothumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F3107%2Fatlasdiplo.png)Detorid's
    Sovereignity is actually divided between several alliances, among them GoonSwarm,
    Red Alliance, Scorched Earth and Legion Of xXDEATHXx [X.I.X].  \n  \nWhile it
    seems certain that [X.I.X] pilots are already fighting against Atlas, it is still
    unclear whether other alliances will react to the invasion.  \n  \nAccording to
    sources inside Atlas, at least 20 Starbases have already been deployed while 17
    starbases allegedly owned by GoonSwarm have been put into reinforced mode.  \n

    of Atlas describes the first hours of combat using these words: \" _We went into
    5 of the 6 station systems and quickly ripped down the jammer in each,   one by
    one\uFEFF... Capitals have been deployed almost non stop... support [was] buzzing
    around doing whatever required_\".  \n  \nOn the other side of the fence, Saint
    xXDEATHXx of [XIX] Alliance said himself not surprised of Atlas Assault: \" _They
    want space really bad and they think its so easy to take. [We] knew that they
    would come. Question is can they keep it like that rush?_ \".  \n  \nHe went on
    adding: \" _the main thing in eve is [to] keep what you got, and it's not easy
    \u2026 we'll see what's gonna bring this weeken_d\".  \n  \nGiven the size of
    the alliances occupying Detorid, it is still unclear whether this conflict will
    remain a regional skirmish or rather develop into a global war.  \n  \nMore updates
    will be published as details become available.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by
