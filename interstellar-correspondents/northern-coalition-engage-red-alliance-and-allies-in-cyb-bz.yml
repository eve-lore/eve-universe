    Coalition forces recently engaged Red Alliance and their allies in the system
    CYB-BZ, a system claimed by Red Alliance. Red Alliance and their allies have,
    for now, successfully defended their system.  \n  \nXxxak, a member of the Northern
    Coalition, explained that their efforts to destroy enemy super carriers had little
    effect, partially due to their falling fleet numbers; \"During the battle we lost
    all of our heavy interdictors to enemy fire, so we had to rely on light interdictors
    to hold them down, but in both cases, the enemy super carriers [Red Alliance]
    were able to escape.\"  \n  \n[![](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4208/good1thumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=)Spatial
    distortions in the system caused major issues as Anubis' Wrath from OWN alliance
    explained \"the [spatial distortions] stopped all reinforcement fleets from getting
    here.\"  \n  \nNorthern Coalition forces have been on a steady assault across
    several regions in the past weeks with several notable successes including the
    battle in solar system LXQ2-T. However it seems that in this instance, Red Alliance
    and their allies have stood firm against the collated superpower.  \n  \n[![](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4208/good2thumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=)Red
    Alliance and friends successfully held onto sovereignty within the system and
    are now retaining a presence in the system in case of any further conflict.\n\n*
