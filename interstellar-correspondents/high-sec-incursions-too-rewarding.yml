    Eden** \\- A group of capsuleers, led by Krissada, are attempting to disrupt the
    \u201CISK farming\u201D currently occurring at Sansha Incursion sites. They are
    planning to destroy Sansha motherships as soon as they arrive through their wormholes
    and in doing so hope to cut back the amount of ISK earned by capsuleers who attend
    the incursions simply to collect bounties on the lesser Sansha forces in the area.
    \ \n  \nKrissada is apparently aggrieved that \"bears\" are able to \"farm\" for
    ISK in high-sec Incursions with little risk as long as they do not destroy the
    Sansha mothership. This, to her, is a blatant misuse of CONCORD's reward system
    and she is focused on stopping what she believes is an \"ISK faucet\". Disgruntled
    with how Incursions are fought she revealed her belief that \"Sansha forces appear
    to be infinite, as is the depth of CONCORD's wallet\".  \n  \nKrissada's plan
    is to destroy the Sansha motherships as soon as possible which will hopefully
    cause the immediate withdrawal of Sansha forces and prevent further bounties being
    collected by \"Incursion Bears\". She hopes to force those wanting to make ISK
    from Incursions into low-sec and thus ensuring when Sansha forces arrive in high-sec
    they are dealt with quickly by capsuleers who want to see victory rather than
    reward.  \n  \nGiving firm backing to Krissada, CSM member Darius III seemed to
    agree that high-sec Incursions are no longer about defeating Sansha's Nation but
    more about what can be earned: \u201CThe sites pay too much with almost no risk.\u201D
    \  \n  \nHardinSalvor, an Incursion community leader, reflected on how things
    have changed due to the lure of ISK: \u201COnce the influence dropped low enough
    for the mom to spawn, people would rush to kill it. Through some diplomacy, a
    status quo was created where we avoid killing the mom as long as possible.\u201D
    \  \n  \nSome questionable math by community leaders sees them believing that
    an incredible 621 billion ISK is paid out by CONCORD every week from Incursions.
    If the numbers are accurate, it may be no surprise that a prominent Fleet Commander
    from the BTL Incursion channel is alleged to have bribed Darius III with 500 million
    ISK to not destroy a mothership during an Incursion.  \n  \nThere is a lot of
    ISK to be made for those brave enough to fight against Sansha's Nation and with
    fleets now forming with the sole purpose of stopping that ISK being collected,
    as well as loyalists already attempting to aid Sansha forces, there may come a
    time soon that there are no capsuleers left to fight against Sansha's Nation as
    they will all be fighting each other.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Krissada's
