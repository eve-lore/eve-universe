    destroying the system's I-HUB ([Infrastructure Hub](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Infrastructure_Hub)),
    Northern Coalition turned their guns on the outpost 'Iridium Plaza'. The outpost
    was placed into reinforced mode at approximately 20:10 New Eden time.  \n  \nJunior
    SvK, a NC fleet commander explained that, \"we gathered 300 [pilots], we jumped
    to system via two gates in same time.\"  \n  \nAndrew Chikatilo, a member of the
    Legion of xXDEATHXx alliance told us that \"pilots are happy that they got something
    to do during winter, without need to go 50 jumps from home to do some [combat].\"
    Although unable to give us an official statement on behalf of his alliance, he
    mentioned from a personal perspective, \"I know we will fight to the end.\"  \n
    \ \nNorthern Coalition members departed the system soon after the station was
    placed into reinforced mode, a member of the alliance, ATRIXOS, saying \"WE WILL
    BE BACK\" as the hundreds of pilots departed.  \n  \nApproximately 1500 ships
    and 500 pods were destroyed during the engagement.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected
