    have defended against heavy attacks upon the 9UY4-H system over the past week;
    an invasion force comprised of several pirate corporations is responsible for
    the attacks. \n\nSykosys, a pilot from U\xB4K, reported that the invasion started
    weeks ago when they saw an increase in the number of Finite Horizon pilots in
    the Providence region. Apparently more like minded corporations and alliances
    joined them such as the Establishment, Coalition of Carebear Killers, Ethereal
    Dawn, Muffins of Mayhem, Veto, Without Reason and Atrox. Rawthorm of The Establishment
    relates: \"Ushra'kahn snuck up its outpost and ever since has used their position
    as \u2018freedom fighters\u2019 to control the area. It was a long time coming
    but we felt only now was the time right to act.\" \n\nRawthorm went on to comment
    on his allies\u2019 motivations for joining the invasion, \"The Establishment
    has a long standing relation with many of the corporations involved. I'd go as
    far as to say that relations with the establishment was a common factor between
    many of the corps who've never worked with each other before. When they heard
    we'd had enough of UK trying to control space which does not belong to them, they
    jumped at the chance to help. I can only speculate as to their individual motives.\"
    \n\nThe reason why Providence and mainly 9UY4-H are under attack is, according
    to the Establishment, that they have always considered the region to be their
    home, a place away from the controlled space that they found elsewhere. They wish
    to free it from the individuals that claim it for themselves. Forces from the
    opposing side claim that they are under attack because the pirates have their
    eyes set on the outpost with the idea to use it as a strategic point into two
    regions and aid their capital ship construction. The Establishment already has
    a Nyx mothership and Sykosys from U\xB4K thinks they may wish to add more of these
    to the collection. \n\nBoth the ISS and U\u2019K responded positively when questioned
    about the collaboration between the two defending alliances. Butter Dog of the
    ISS explained that U\xB4K is a good neighbour \u201Cwho has allowed trade to flourish\u201D
    while keeping unwanted pilots out of the area. Sykosys also commented that the
    pirates were common enemies of the two allies, with previous attacks being made
    against ISS Outposts in the area. \n\nRawthorn is more sceptical regarding the
    future of this joint effort: \u201CLike many relations in this universe, they
    base theirs on convenience. There is no money here for ISS and unless they can
    carry out their threat to take the station to prevent us from doing so, then we
    do not see ISS committing to this in the long term.\u201D \n\nHe went on to add,
    \u201CAnd should they act on that threat, well I can't imagine UK would be happy
    with their only outpost under ISS control.\u201D The future of the UNITY outpost
    remains uncertain and Verone of Veto speculated on its future, \u201CLets just
    say that many things have been considered, even including auctioning the outpost
    off to the highest bidder, we had a laugh about that. As for the outpost itself,
    there's been a lot of talk as to what people want to do with it. Our plan is simple
    in the end; the intervention of ISS in my eyes is a setback but I\u2019m sure
    we can overcome it.\u201D \n\nDiscussing the ISS involvement in depth Verone added,
    \u201CISS are very preoccupied with their own sovereignty and patrolling their
    space. We've already proven that organising indiscriminate killing raids into
    their sovereign system draws the bulk of their force away, and drags their command
    into disarray. While they would like UNITY to remain in the hands of Ushra'Khan,
    I believe their true objective is the protection of their own assets.\u201D \n\nWhen
    questioned about the invasion hindering U\xB4K from freeing their enslaved brothers
    and sisters, Rawthorm commented: \u201CFreedom is at the very heart of this war,
    freedom from empire and D.E.D control. Sadly in their quest for freedom, U\xB4K
    see fit to curtail everyone else\u2019s and this is not acceptable to us.\u201D
    Sykosys in turn regards the members of the pirate coalition to be slaves of their
    own interest, \u201CNo long term vision or focus for them. I pity them in all
    honesty. For in their own thinking they are as slaves. Slaves to their own selfishness
    and greed. Which will ultimately destroy them.\u201D \n\nAs of yet the UNITY Outpost
    has not changed ownership."
