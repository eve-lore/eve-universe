    New Eden** \\- Forces on both sides of the Triumvirate [TRI] and NC conflict have
    recently expanded their ranks with fresh alliances eager to join the quickly escalating
    war.  \n  \nRed.Overlord [R.O.L], Ev0ke [EV0KE], and Huzzah Federation [HF] have
    aligned with [TRI] while NC member Mostly Harmless [-42-] recently absorbed into
    their ranks long time ally Avarice [FAIL] along with several hundred members from
    Dara Cothrom [DACO]. Both [FAIL] and [DACO] were major space-holders in the Cloud
    Ring region resulting in [-42-] becoming Cloud Ring's primary landlord seemingly
    overnight.  \n  \nIn total, these additions add nearly 750 pilot's to [-42-]'s
    ranks and over 1,800 combatants to the anti-NC forces.  \n  \nDuring a recent
    sit-down with Darknesss of [TRI] he indicated that the new additions are only
    a temporary measure \"to help deal damage to a common enemy. It's simply a case
    of 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend.'\"\n\n### Engagement Recap\n\nMuch has
    happened since WTF ([WN], [TRI], and friends) garnered the attention of the universe
    by destroying five RAZOR motherships in Branch. A week later the war began in
    ernest when over 1,000 NC and WTF pilots engaged in E-7U8U, Venal - a battle marked
    by extensive spatial disturbances and over 115 capital losses (weighing significantly
    in NC's favour).  \n  \nThree weeks later the conflict once again flared following
    several weeks of lessened activity due to Morsus Mihi's [RAWR] successful recapture
    of the 25 high value moons taken by WTF. The renewed fighting was attributed to
    an [EV0KE] and [HF] joint assault on [-42-] systems in Cloud Ring centering around
    9-4RP2.  \n  \nOn May 27th, WTF, [EV0KE], and [HF] hotdropped on top of a [-42-]
    capital fleet as they were attacking an [EVOKE] tower in 9-4. Both fleets numbered
    between 100 and 150 pilots, however [-42-] was severely outgunned and lost 25
    capitals while the WTF coalition suffered only 3-5 capital losses. [-42-] has
    since regrouped and removed all enemy towers from 9-4 resulting in reduced combat
    activities for the time being.\n\n### What Next?\n\nThe future of the north is
    still very much in the air as neither side has shown any signs of weakening. The
    NC's ability to replace capital losses has of course been no surprise, but WTF's
    equally impressive replenishment rate has left many scratching their heads.  \n
    \ \n\"...people are speculating where we're getting our isk from,\" Darkness commented,
    \"frankly, it doesn't matter. The fact is our capital fleet is now as big as it
    was before the E-7 Capital fight and we are eager to fight again.\"  \n  \n[RAWR]
    CEO Vuk Lau claims to have a very good idea of where the ISK is coming from and
    indicated that this information was obtained from recent diplomatic conversations
    with [TRI].  \n  \nIn regards to the sustainability of defending the north while
    \"purging\" the south, Vuk Lau stated that while WTF is an \"annoyance\", it is
    no strain on [RAWR] to return and defend NC property. \"Even easier then to travel
    two jumps,\" he states.  \n  \nHowever, Vuk Lau hinted that [RAWR] are beginning
    to tire of the southern crusade against KenZoku [RKZ] and are continuing to keep
    their eyes on the north as the \"hostile to NC\" bloc expands.  \n  \n\"...as
    much as killing our arch-enemies formerly known as BoB is enjoyment, especially
    after Max, we are experiencing less and less resistance and [the] north will soon
    become fun place to be,\" Vuk Lau concluded.  \n  \nAs for WTF's future - Darknesss
    had this to say:  \n  \n\"Triumvirate aren't going anywhere, we will not disband
    like your leadership hopes. We are in your corporations, in your alliances and
    we will kill you however we can whenever we can no matter how long it takes.\"\n\n###
