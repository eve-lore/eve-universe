- body: "INSMOTHER. War is still raging in the south-eastern regions of New Eden,
    as operations against the coalition were intensified by the Red Alliance. \n\nStepping
    up military efforts in its former territories, the Red Alliance has regained sovereignty
    in the C-J6MT Factory and momentarily that of the F2A-GX Refinery in the Insmother
    region. Several Capital-class encounters have marked the campaign over the last
    few weeks, most notable of which was the second Capital-class only fleet fielded
    by the RA against the coalition - successfully this time. \n\nThe war remains
    very dependant on logistics, as both parties vie for sovereignty over strategic
    systems and resources; the F2A-GX system alone counts over sixty Starbases, and
    the fight for the coalition to regain control of its Refinery occured moon by
    moon. \n\nIt would seem that the conflict is taking a new turn, as the Red Alliance
    is adapting to its new condition and environment.  \nAfter that some of its forces
    seceded, it has had to change its tactics, and is now much more keen on using
    guerrilla warfare, 'hit and run' tactics as well as spectacular coups intended
    to bolster troop morale while undermining that of the enemy. \n\nHaving the benefit
    of the first strike due to its mobility and roaming tactics, the Red Alliance
    has effectively been pressuring the coalition despite their lower numbers. This
    has pushed Lotka Volterra into shortening its campaign against the Interstellar
    Alcoholic Conglomerate in order to address more pressing issues in their homeland.
    \n\nA reform has also taken place in the coalition in an effort to consolidate
    its numbers and infrastructure; change and mergers occured in both the Lotka Volterra
    and Chimaera Pact alliances, with regions changing hands, as well as the settlement
    of a new alliance in the area \u2013 E.R.A. \n\nMost analysts, however, remain
    quite pessimistic as to hopes of stability in the regions. \n\nAccording to Kep
    Ekatemi, an eminent political analyst from the University of Caille, \u201Cchances
    for negotiations and a subsequent peace treaty are minute at best, since both
    parties have been waging war against one another for too long.\u201D   \nFor him,
    \u201Clong-drawn conflicts diminish any likelihood of compromise. Historically,
    those have rarely been settled peacefully.\u201D \n\nHe does point out that \u201Cthis
    does not prevent veteran corporations from venturing into the field to exploit
    the resources.\u201D An exploitation that comes at a cost that is not only financial;
    \u201CAccess to the resources does not always cost ISK, but it does ask for political
    alignment with the power in place. This can have an adverse affect, as entrepreneurs
    become prime targets and are drawn in a war they were not prepared for.\u201D
    \n\nAs if to reinforce the analysts\u2019 conjectures, the global situation does
    not seem to have changed much since the conflict started - more than six months
    ago - when Chimaera Pact and Veritas Immortalis first clashed with the Red Alliance.
    \n\nOnly roles have been reversed. \n\nFor the coalition, the goal now is to bring
    stability to the regions. On the other hand, for the Red Alliance, the goal is
    now just the opposite; deny stability and prosperity to its enemies. \n\n\u201CIt
    is a area of space that has been quite unstable since the collapse of the Curse
    Alliance\u201D concludes Mr. Ekatemi, \u201Cno one entity has held it long enough
    for it to prosper, and each new war is becoming more costly for those trying to
    bring stability.\u201D"
