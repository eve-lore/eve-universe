- body: "Yulai, once a vibrant trade hub, now slowly decaying. What used to be one
    of the largest open markets in our space has lost a significant portion of trade
    to other systems, a direct result of the stargate re-routing which took place
    almost two months ago, when the Gallente Federation and Minmatar Republic took
    action against rampant smuggling of illegal goods. The dwindling of trade in Yulai
    has not surprised trade moguls.   \n  \nVisiting Yulai, I had the opportunity
    to speak to KIAEddz, CEO of mercenary corporation KIA Corp (KillerZ in Action).
    Asking him why he thought most trade was leaving Yulai, he responded:   \n  \n\"Two
    words. It's dead. It's simply too many jumps, too far away.\"   \n  \nAnd he has
    a point. It seems Oursulaert and Jita have replaced Yulai, probably because of
    their location. Another factor, according to KIAEddz, is the presence of high-profile
    employers, who are eager to employ privateer pod-pilots. Oursulaert alone boasts
    the highest number of registered pod-pilots, whereas Yulai numbers have dropped
    staggeringly. To compare - at the time this article was printed, Oursulaert had
    232 active pilots, Yulai had only 48. Jita numbered 208 pilots in space.   \n
    \ \nAlthough the Yulai torch seems to have passed to Caldari space, each region
    seems to have its own hotspot. Condensed information gathered by influential traders
    shows that Rens, Pator, Amarr and Alenia have all benefitted from the proactive
    anti-smuggling stances of the Minmatar Republic and Gallente Federation."
