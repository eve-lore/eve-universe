    Imperial Apocalypse, today announced their intention to release the \u201CImpoc,\u201D
    as it has become colloquially known, into the hands of the Amarr Navy.   \n  \nAccording
    to a source inside the corporation, Ionstar\u2019s board of directors is \u201Cwell
    aware that the Empire wants it back badly. As we are loyal citizens of the Empire
    and would not appreciate the attention a ship of this immense stature would garner,
    we thought it best that it be returned to its original owner.\u201D   \n  \nThe
    Apocalypse will be taken in a procession, starting at roughly 23:00 EVT, from
    an undisclosed Ionstar hangar in the Trigentia constellation to the Amarrian Throne
    Worlds, where it will be formally handed over to presiding Imperial Navy Chief
    of Staff Ravin Mehnih. In order to prevent the attention of undesirable elements
    during the journey, Amarr loyalist paramilitaries have reportedly been contacted
    by Ionstar agents to act as escorts for the journey.   \n  \nSpokesmen from the
    Imperial Chancellor\u2019s Office expressed relief at the news. \u201COf course
    we\u2019re glad this fiasco is over. Obviously, the ship is one of our most prized
    creations and it belongs with its rightful owners. It gladdens the Emperor to
    see the loyalty his greatness has managed to inspire in his subjects.\u201D"
