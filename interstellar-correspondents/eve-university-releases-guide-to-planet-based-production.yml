    released a new guide earlier this week, aimed at those capsuleers interested in
    expanding into industry through planetary extraction, processing and production.
    The guide is accompanied by a \"quick start\" holoreel.   \n  \nThe guide, available

    outlines useful skills for pilots interested in planetary production to study,
    then goes into detail on planet categorization and provides walkthroughs on how
    to scan for resources, set up colony facilities, link them together and harvest
    finished commodities.   \n  \nA further section which examines possible production
    chains from raw materials to finished products, is expected to be revised shortly.
    \  \n  \nAlong with the guide, the Eve University team has released a \"quick
    start\" holoreel which has already been viewed over 10,000 times.   \n  \nThe
    Eve University guide to planetary production was released on the 25.05.112 and,
    along with its accompanying video, has so far been favourably reviewed by the
    pilot community.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Eve University Planetary Production
