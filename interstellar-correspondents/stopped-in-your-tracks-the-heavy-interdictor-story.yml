- body: "The recent release of the new Heavy Interdictor cruisers was set to shake
    the cluster in many ways. Many were enticed by the potent defenses these ships
    offer. Other pilots were attracted to these unique vessels by their ability to
    generate warp interdiction spheres. But the real allure, the thing that sets pilots\u2019
    mouths agape and makes their knees tremble is the Heavy Interdictor\u2019s power
    to stop _any_ ship. Any ship at all.\n\nIn order to attain faster-than-light speeds,
    ships generate a bubble of \u201Cdepleted vacuum\u201D \u2013 space leeched of
    all free energy \u2013 in which they glide from point to point free of the constraints
    of normal space-time. A standard warp disruptor works by bleeding energy into
    another ship\u2019s warp core, preventing it leeching the surrounding space sufficiently
    to allow a bubble to form. However, warp core stabilization equipment can circumvent
    such tactics. To undeniably prevent a warp by any ship, it takes a powerful, focused
    warp disruption field that suffuses the surrounding space with energy.\n\nTo achieve
    this warp disruption effect, the giant, throbbing disruption engines of a Heavy
    Interdictor are required. But as with any fine tools, there is an art to using
    them in order to achieve the most knee-trembling effect. I have been able to talk
    to one well versed in their use, someone who makes pod pilots quite literally
    stop dead in their tracks: the aVoCaDo MuFfInMaN.\n\n\u201CThe Broadsword is my
    weapon of choice. Since we are a pirate [corporation] and have a lot of people
    coming through with [warp core stabilizers], it is the ultimate tackler with the
    infinite point script. And, of course, it has an amazing tank with which you can
    survive the sentries.\"\n\nHowever, as with all things, it is a case of the right
    tool for the job.\n\n\u201CSince a Broadsword can\u2019t use bubbles in 0.4 [security
    space], we don\u2019t use them in \u2018belt pirating.\u2019 We prefer the Lachesis,
    since we are attacking people that don\u2019t expect it\u2026 and those people
    generally don\u2019t use [warp core stabilizers]. We prefer the longer disruptor
    range.\u201D\n\nSo, which is the best Heavy Interdictor to choose? For the aVoCaDo
    MuFfInMaN, there are only two choices, the Phobos or the Broadsword.\n\n\u201CI
    chose the Broadsword because I\u2019m more skilled in [the use of] Minmatar ships,
    and I have [had extensive engineering training].. I think those two are about
    equal though \u2013 it\u2019s down to skill as to which one you pick. But if you
    don\u2019t have people to [remote sensor] boost you, the Phobos would be nice
    because of the extra mid-slots not used for tanking.\u201D\n\n\u201CMy favourite
    encounters have been with transport ships. Before I started using the Broadsword,
    those ships were almost uncatchable.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhen you are a pirate, the
    only way of becoming really good is by teamwork. There are always people remote
    sensor boosting me \u2013 high enough to catch anything that comes through except
    maybe an interceptor or a shuttle. Usually we use a Scorpion with 4 scripted remote
    sensor boosters.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhen you have years of experience with pirating,
    you miss a lot of targets and each target you miss, you want to improve yourself
    by all means so that next time, you won\u2019t miss that target. By experience,
    your tactics get perfected \u2013 and the HIC are a new tool to achieve that perfection.\u201D\n\nSo
    what is the HIC\u2019s key to success in piracy?\n\n\u201CIf you want to be truly
    successful with a gatecamp, a tackler with infinite [warp disruption] \u2018points\u2019
    is required. A heavy interdictor isn\u2019t any use if he doesn\u2019t have an
    insta-lock, so don\u2019t go out there with 400 scan resolution because that would
    defeat the purpose of the ships \u2013 to tackle better and faster than all other
    ships.\u201D\n\nWhile the aVoCaDo MuFfInMaN informed me on the finer points of
    HIC use, he was able to lock down and destroy over 25 star ships. Whatever your
    opinions of these cruiser-size vessels are, the heavy interdictors are certainly
    a powerful new tool for pirates within New Eden."
