    GEMINATE** \\- United Freeman Alliance [UFA] has retracted all territorial claims
    to the Geminate region as of May 2nd following a nearly month long defensive campaign
    against Wildly Inappropriate [WI].  \n  \nThe news arrived in the form of a short
    press release from [UFA] diplomat Spaceman who simply stated that \"...the 'United
    Freemen Alliance' officially surrenders all of its claim to territory in Geminate
    to Wildly Inappropriate.\"  \n  \nThe [WI] invasion of Geminate commenced on April
    7th and resulted in the prompt expulsion of Idle Empire [IDLE] followed by an
    assault on Ethereal Dawn's [ED] territory in the 8K-CHA constellation. This move
    allowed for easy access to the NK-AOZ constellation - [UFA]'s primary holding
    in Geminate.  \n  \nThe first several days of the conflict saw the loss of several
    [UFA] carriers at the hands of [WI] who held a sizable numerical advantage over
    [UFA]. Additionally, Ad Astra [I A I] opened a second front on [UFA] and inflicted
    steady losses including the capture of several [UFA] systems in the ZYL-FT constellation.
    Internal attrition was also an issue for [UFA] as the alliance declined from over
    a thousand members to less then four hundred and fifty members by war's end.  \n
    \ \nTomcat of [WI] stated that the final operation took place around 05:00 on
    Saturday with a one hundred strong battleship operation that targeted [UFA]'s
    cyno jammer in K25-XD. Following its destruction, [WI]'s capital fleet entered
    the field and proceeded to reinforce four towers at which time diplomatic channels
    were opened with [UFA].  \n  \nA cease-fire commenced during the diplomatic maneuvering
    and was soon followed by the official surrender of [UFA]'s Geminate territory
    to [WI] around 10:30.  \n  \n\"WI accepts the terms agree'd and wishes [UFA] the
    best of luck further on,\" Tomcat announced in [WI]'s official response.  \n  \nProceedings
    have been cordial up to this point with kind words all around.  \n\n### **GalNet
