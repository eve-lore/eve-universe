    pilots fly across the starry skies oblivious of the forgotten wonders waiting
    to be rediscovered. \n\nEpic monuments, abandoned stations, crumbling ruins, weird
    and wonderful spacial phenomena, just some of the sights waiting to be seen. \n\nFor
    those pilots who want to experience something different, for those who are wanting
    to capture the spirit of adventure and exploration, here is a collection of some
    of New Edens most important natural, man-made and other mysteriously fabricated
    landmarks and points of interest. \n\nSetting off from the remote port of Polaris
    we will travel in each of the cardinal directions documenting our finds. \n\nSince
    the start of the journey we have seen many things, now as we head in a western
    direction what will we find?\n\n* * *\n\n**Journeying Into The West**\n\n* * *\n\n__Cord
    Of The Elements__\n\n  * As we start on this leg of our journey we discover that
    winding through the Syndicate region is a natural phenomenon that has baffled
    scientists for centuries. The phenomenon, a super-dense dark cloud, bends time
    in such a way that all space-travel in or close to the phenomenon is impossible,
    or at least extremely hazardous. Most scientists believe that the Cord is the
    remnant of collision between two black holes millions of years ago that permanently
    'scarred' space. Others belief the Cord to be the result of a science experiment,
    possibly conducted by alien life forms, that went seriously awry eons ago. Needless
    to say we cannot travel close to the area so we will continue on.   \n  \n\n  *

    Cosmos__\n\n  * Our next stop finds us looking over the fields of Trace Cosmos.
    This area holds miniscule black holes and weird spatial rifts, making it much
    too dangerous to traverse. It is widely believed that the fields are the remnants
    of a massive collision between two galaxies millions of years ago. The colossal
    occurrence permanently altered the areas most affected, turning them into barren
    death traps.   \n  \n\n  * _Entered Via_ : N/A \n  * _CONCORD / DED Rating_ :
    N/A \n\n\n* * *\n\n__The Cauldron__\n\n  * In the area simply known as The Cauldron,
    the remnants of several supernovas render the space unstable and treacherous.
    Filled with volatile gravity currents and large chunks of stellar debris the whole
    area is much too dangerous for space travel. The Cauldron lies between the Amarr
    Empire and the Khanid Kingdom and acts as a convenient natural barrier between
    the two hostile factions. It also has now stopped us proceeding in that direction,
    and although we are still unable to get any meaningful visual records, we have
    collected some interesting data we can study later. Our next stop is something
    we have been looking forward to for some time.   \n  \n\n  * _Entered Via_ : N/A
    \n  * _CONCORD / DED Rating_ : N/A \n\n\n* * *\n\n__The EVE Gate__\n\n  * In the
    system of New Eden sits the impenetrable EVE Gate. Thousands of years ago the
    forefathers of all the human races used the gate to travel to the world of EVE.
    But the gate has been closed for a long time, a catastrophe that destroyed all
    planets in the New Eden system and plunged the fragile human settlements to the
    brink of extinction. Anyone foolish enough to get too close to the gate today
    will be ripped apart by the magnetic storms that still surround the massive gate.
    Despite the dangers in this area there are still signs that many like us have
    made this pilgrimage.   \n  \n\n  * _Entered Via_ : New Eden \n  * _CONCORD /
