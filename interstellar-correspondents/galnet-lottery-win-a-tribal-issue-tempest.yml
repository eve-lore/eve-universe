    valor, commitment and the unending struggle for freedom, the Tribal Issue Tempest
    is a rare and celebrated ship. To own one is an immense honour. Pilots of the
    also-rare Republic Fleet Issue tempest look on in envy at the the tribal version,
    which was once known simply as the \"Storm\".\n\nIt is a far superior ship than
    its more basic counterparts; equipped with stronger electronics subsystems, updated
    shield arrays, strengthened armour plating and re-engineered propulsion vents.
    Stories have been told of the few captains to pilot one and how they have had
    special nano-tattoos implanted to celebrate both the gift of the ship and the
    honour of piloting it. \n\nAnd now the chance has arisen for _you_ to pilot one.
    \n\nThere are only four remaining examples of this vessel across the cluster that
    are known to exist within a capsuleer's reach. Due to the rarity of these ships,
    conservative estimates put the value somewhere between 85 and 100 billion ISK.
    This ensures that these vessels will rarely ever be seen in space let alone the
    front lines of combat. Most likely they are all stored away in private collections,
    used for ceremonial purposes or even as investments. \n\nOne of these four tempests
    was awarded by the Republic Tribes to a small group from The Ronin alliance as
    a payment for an undisclosed service. These pilots have decided to have a GalNet-wide
    lottery with the prize being this unique craft. New Eden residents can purchase
    tickets by visiting the reference page given below. The draw will be held on the
    22nd of December. \n\nGood luck to all. \n\n_External GalNet Browser References_
