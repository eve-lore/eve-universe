- body: "Gotchy \u2013 a director within the Rona Corporation announced in a press
    release on Monday that his organisation had become the latest victim in a recent
    trend of corporate robbery.   \n  \nSpeaking in an interview on Wednesday evening,
    the director explained that the incident \u2013 which occurred at around 14:00
    EVE Standard time on Monday had seen the removal of five to six billion ISK worth
    of assets and corporate funds including a large number of ships and modules as
    well as numerous industrial goods such as blue print copies, construction components,
    and an extensive mineral stockpile.   \n  \nGotchy went on to explain that Rona\u2019s
    most valuable properties, a selection of Tech level one and two blueprint originals,
    had been locked down at the time and were fortunately spared.   \n  \nWhen asked
    if he thought the theft would have a serious impact on Rona or its future, he
    explained that \u201Cat first I thought we were bankrupt and non existent. Now
    that I see the will of our membership to rebuild RONA, I call it a minor setback\u201D.
    He went on to state that after the initial shock, the incident had united their
    members and that they were \u201Ca stronger RONA now\u201D, citing that the corporation\u2019s
    monetary funds had already been restored.   \n  \nAfter being questioned about
    the identity of the thief and his possible motivations, the director explained
    that the individual was known to them and was a trusted member after joining the
    Rona Corporation six months ago; following an altercation with several Rona pilots
    which had resulted in his pod death and the destruction of his vessel. Astonishingly,
    it emerged that the thief had declared his crime to be an act of retribution for
    this incident.   \n  \nThe director went on to state that as a result of the theft
    their recruitment will be suspended, pending improvements to their application
    screening. Upon enquiring about their stance toward the thief, who is known to
    them as 420Duck, Gotchy declared that: \u201CHis crime is a major one. The penalty
    is death by firing squad. If you think a man in my position doesn\u2019t have
    contacts around the universe you are wrong. He will be hunted until found\u201D.
    \  \n  \nThe Rona Corporation was founded over two years ago by its CEO and capsuleer
    pilot Robeyone. Initially starting out with aspirations of becoming an industrial
    powerhouse, Rona expanded into other areas and created a number of sister corporations
    such as RONA-Midgard Academy as necessity demanded.   \n  \nAfter serving as a
    member of the Phoenix Alliance, Rona left after the Great Northern War to rebuild
    and regain its strength, finally settling in the western fringes of the EVE star
    cluster and forming the Imperium alliance. Admitting that the Rona Corporation
    was no longer the Mega Corporation it had been in the past, Gotchy explained that
    that the Rona members were working hard to return their organisation to its previous
    status."
