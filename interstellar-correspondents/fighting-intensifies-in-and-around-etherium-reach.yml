    and super capital ships have been deployed to the Etherium Reach, Insmother and
    Geminate regions. There have been heavy losses, with estimates pointing toward
    a combined total of at least 400 ships lost in the past week alone, including
    the destruction of 16 dreadnoughts, 7 carriers and an Intrepid Crossing Aeon class
    mothership.  \n  \nAlthough the cause of the war is unclear, fighting continues
