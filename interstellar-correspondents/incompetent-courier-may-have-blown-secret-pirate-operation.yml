- body: "The system of Scolluzer, like many others in EVE is a hive of activity, where
    thousands of pilots make deals they hope will bring them riches. Tonight it played
    host to a different and altogether more suspicious deal which was, rather oddly,
    discussed over the local communications net.   \n  \nRoni Rylly, an old pilot
    with a less than impressive resume was waiting to meet a courier who was somewhat
    more than late. A second pilot, Emilio Ostaban offered to use a location agent
    to find the missing courier.   \n  \nIt was a long time before the courier, named
    Freaks Slanderous appeared. He expressed his apologies for being late and handed
    over the package. While this might seem like an ordinary occurrence, Freaks loose
    tongue is what elevates this incident from the benign to the serious. He mentioned
    that the name of the person who sent the package was one Lord Mordekai or Lucius
    Mordekai. Mordekai is well known for his illegal actions within medium and low
    security space, as well as his confrontations with various bodies and arms of
    major corporations, some freelancers often falling prey to his sick and unmerciful
    games of cat and mouse. Mordekai is wanted by many authorities across the universe.
    \  \n  \nBoth Emilio and Roni were quick to escape after Freaks let loose that
    information, leaving him alone in the system. Freaks undocked shortly after both
    Emilio and Roni had left sounding desperate and panicked as observers of this
    deal had amassed an interest when the informations about Mordekai was revealed.
    \  \n  \nFreaks however, despite his panicked state, managed to outfox more than
    fifty ships following him by leading them all towards the wrong gate. Once they
    were all there waiting for him, he left by another stargate into the Alentene
    system. By the time the pilots realised their error, he was gone.   \n  \nScolluzer
    is a 0.8 security system, way above the level that Mordekai is known to operate
    him. Officials are urging for people to be on the lookout for strange activity,
    and are advised not to approach any of the 3 individuals present in Scolluzer
    that night."
