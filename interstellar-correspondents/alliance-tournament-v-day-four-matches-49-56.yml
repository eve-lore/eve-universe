- body: "Welcome to Day Four of the **Fifth Alliance Tournament**. Here are the initial
    results and reviews of the first eight matches of the day. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match
    49: Blood Blind Vs When Fat Kids Attack**\n\nAn \"exhibition match\" between the
    two teams at the bottom of the group who agreed to restrict themselves entirely
    to out and out combat. Blood Blind came away with their first victory of the tournament
    against FATTY and made it a decisive one too, claiming a totalhelldeath victory.\n\n**Blood
    Blind:** 2 Drake | 3 Harbinger | Dramiel | Rifter  \n**When Fat Kids Attack:**
    Hyperion | Armageddon | Brutix | Vexor\n\nWithin the opening moments of the fight
    the FATTY Vexor was instantly taken down and their Brutix was quickly to follow
    under heavy Harbinger laser fire. From there any damage output was drastically
    reduced and up against five Battlecruisers, it was all over for FATTY. It was
    an interesting team formation from Blood Blind, who showed that a Battlecruiser-heavy
    formation can work. They can walk away from the tournament with a win on their
    record. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 50: The Kadeshi Vs Molotov Coalition**\n\nOne of
    the closest matches of the tournament, The Kadeshi came away with a win against
    Molotov Coalition, just barely managing to survive the onslaught of their triple-Megathron
    squad.\n\n**The Kadeshi:** Guardian | 5 Vexor Navy Issue | Sentinel | 2 Griffin
    \ \n**Molotov Coalition:** 3 Megathrons | Maulus | 6 Griffins\n\nWithin the opening
    minutes of the fight the support of both sides had been removed from the field,
    with Griffins dropping on both sides to drone and blaster fire. All that remained
    after the frigate slaughter was a lone Sentinel - which later came to play an
    important role. From there the Vexors sent their drones on to a single Megathron,
    as they all closed range on the Guardian and dispatched it in short order.\n\nThe
    fight wasn\u2019t over at that point however, as 5 Vexors and 25 drones continued
    to chew threw the Megathron\u2019s armor. By the time they\u2019d lost their first
    Vexor, the Megathron was on its way out. Three more Vexors fell in exchange for
    another, putting a great deal of damage onto the remaining one as they were taken
    down. All that was left after the carnage was a badly beaten Megathron in low
    armor and a Vexor in much the same position, flanked by a Sentinel. Keeping safe
    from the Megathron fire whilst directing its drones onwards, the Vexor slowly
    whittled it down as the Sentinel safely worked away on its capacitor. With only
    4% structure left on the Vexor and the Megathron stopping for a reload, the match
    went Kadeshi's way. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 51: Hydra Alliance Vs Notoriety Alliance**\n\nNotoriety
    brought another interesting formation to bear this time, but found no weak links
    to exploit in the brutal ten-Thorax team of Hydra, who gave them their first loss.
    It was a battle of strategy this time, with both teams adapting their tactics
    on the fly and trying to outdo one another.\n\n**Hydra Alliance:** 10 Thorax  \n**Notoriety
    Alliance:** Scimitar | 3 Vigilants | 2 Sentinel | 2 Keres | Kitsune\n\nWith a
    single Thorax taken down in exchange for a Vigilant, it looked as if it would
    be quickly over for Notoriety. ECM drones swarmed the Scimitar, stopping it from
    doing it\u2019s job and another Vigilant was lost as a second Thorax hit deep
    hull. With 8 Thoraxes left on the field and their third Vigilant lost for only
    slight armor damage on a single Thorax, it seemed as if the battle was a foregone
    conclusion.\n\nNotoriety kept their cool however, adapting their strategy on the
    fly and maintaining pressure on the damaged Thorax. Whittling down its armor with
    their drones, they eventually removed it from field and went to work on another.
    Keeping their frigates safe, they looked as if they might actually come away with
    a win if they only killed two more Thorax. Hydra turned the battle around however,
    removing the opposition drones from the field and scoring a kill on a webbed Sentinel.
    As the fourth Thorax slipped into very low hull, Hydra hurriedly removed the last
    of the drones and escaped with both 7 Thorax and a win when time was called. \n\n*
    * *\n\n**Match 52: Synchr0nicity Vs Green Alliance**\n\nGreen came away with another
    win and yet another totalhelldeath as they tore apart the Synchr0nicity team with
    surgical precision, changing their tactics to nullify their opponent's.\n\n**Synchr0nicity:**
    Abaddon | 2 Dominix | Myrmidon  \n**Green Alliance:** Absolution | 4 Ishtar |
    Vengeance\n\nThe match started with Green sending in a drone swarm towards Synchron0city,
    whose own conspicuous lack of drones signaled the imminence of some smartbombing.
    Withdrawing them before any were lost, Green exchanged them on the field for sentry
    drones, which immediately began to trouble the Myrmidon and eventually take it
    down. From there the match slowly slipped away from Synchr0nicity as their Battleships
    fell under the fire of the drones and Absolution lasers. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match
    53: Pandemic Legion Vs Ethereal Dawn**\n\nPandemic needed to come away with a
    decisive win in this battle and did just that with a totalhelldeath win.\n\n**Pandemic
    Legion:** 2 Guardians | Rook | Curse | 2 Thorax  \n**Ethereal Dawn:** 3 Abaddon
    | 2 Kitsune | 2 Vigils\n\nImmediately trying to alpha-strike the Rook from the
    field, ED met some stiff resistance from the dual-Guardians. Unable to throw the
    logistics pilots by switching targets to the Curse and then later spreading it
    across both vessels, they found few weaknesses and made no further progress as
    they lost their Kitsunes. The Curse had by this time thoroughly troubled the capacitor
    of one of the Abaddons and it was taken down. From there another Abaddon was neutralized
    and dropped in tandem with one of the Vigils. Repeating the process, Pandemic
    came away with a much-needed high points win that takes them to the top of the
    group. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 54: Brutally Clever Empire Vs Cry Havoc.**\n\nCry
    Havoc. outdid their opponents this time with a tried and tested setup easily outdoing
    the drone-reliant formation fielded by Bruce and coming away with a totalhelldeath
    win.\n\n**Brutally Clever Empire:** 4 Ishtar | 5 Ishkurs  \n**Cry Havoc.:** 3
    Dominix | Guardian\n\nWith three logistically-supported Dominix staring off a
    mass of drone-heavy vessels, it looked grim from the beginning for Bruce. Bruce
    had no answer for the Dominix smartbombs and saw the loss of a great number of
    their drones early on. Sitting comfortable, Cry Havoc. got to work on dispatching
    the Ishtars and the rest of the team. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 55: Cosa Nostra. Vs
    Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate**\n\nThe \u201Cfourteen billion ISK match\u201D.
    IAC came up against the group leaders Cosa Nostra. who cruised through with yet
    another convincing win and a totalhelldeath against IAC.\n\n**Cosa Nostra.:**
    2 Abaddon | 2 Oneiros | 2 Rifter  \n**Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate:** 5 Ishtar
    | 5 Griffin\n\nCosa Nostra. quickly got to work on the Griffins of IAC using the
    Abaddon\u2019s lethal EM alpha-strike. Focusing their fire on the Rifters which
    were busy killing drones, IAC made no progress in the face of some masterfully
    executed logistics from the Oneiros pilots. With their ECM removed from the field
    and only the Ishtars remaining, IAC had no chance to break the logistics chain
    and were slowly picked apart. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 56: Blade. Vs Phalanx Alliance**\n\nThe
    second draw of the tournament this time around, as neither side managed to break
    down their opponents logistics chains.\n\n**Blade.:** 2 Dominix | 2 Basilisks
    | 2 Vigils  \n**Phalanx Alliance :** 2 Hyperion | Dominix | Guardian\n\nBoth teams
    brought some competent logistics piloting to the field and played it safe. With
    no points scored by either team, Phalanx managed to deny Blade a shot at a finals
    placing. \n\n* * *"
