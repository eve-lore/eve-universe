- body: "Over the past few months there have been a growing number of pod pilots taking
    notice of a young, quick witted and sometimes foolhardy capsuleer named Innominate
    Nightmare. Much to the dismay of his instructors at the Caldari State War Academy,
    he decided to jump in a shuttle and head off to unsecured space in search of what
    he termed \u201CThe meaning of life\u201D. Recently though, his actions have made
    some people wonder if his intentions are philosophical or financial in nature.
    \n\nHis journey so far has taken him from the Venal region in the north to the
    Stain region in the south and he has had many interesting, amusing, romantic and
    sometimes dangerous encounters with capsule pilots in the many solar systems he
    has visited. \n\nWhen asked what his most memorable experience has been so far,
    he answered,\u201D\u2026 it could be quite difficult to choose a favorite, although
    if I were forced to pick I would have to go with the parade of capital ships that
    [ gave me to when I first arrived at their home system.\u201D \n\nAlthough he
    had started his self appointed \u2018experiment\u2019 with a meager one million
    ISK, his wallet soon fattened with donations from pilots he has encountered. Some
    giving money, some giving ships, some offering to let him tag along as they destroyed
    pirates to let him take a portion of what salvageable modules where left behind.
    \n\nHis self generated celebrity has caused Innominate to also become the target
    of some amorous approaches from other pod pilots, most notably Missytrex who promised
    him a vast fortune, and Frivolous who offered to kill Missytrex to acquire his
    favor. Innominate briefly flirted with the idea of hiring the Mercenary Coalition
    to dispatch Missytrex so he could steal her assets and run off with Frivolous,
    but this scheme was short lived after the Mercenary Coalition refused the contract.
    \n\nJust recently though Innominate has offered to let pilots purchase shares
    in his one man corporation named \u201CInnominate Neutrality\u201D. \n\nValued
    at one million ISK per share, he has made five thousand shares available to potential
    investors, while keeping five thousand one shares for him self as CEO. Many capsuleers
    have already invested in \u201CInnominate Neutrality\u201D even though he has
    no business plan. \n\nInnominate said, \u201CI now found myself with a balance
    rapidly approaching one billion isk\u201D. \n\nHe has now acquired over one billion
    isk. \n\nOne has to wonder what his future intentions are."
