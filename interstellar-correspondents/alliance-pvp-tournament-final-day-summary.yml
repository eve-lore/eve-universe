- body: "The last day of the tournament saw Band of Brothers move through the final
    rounds and secure victory and the first prize against Ascendant Frontier. \n\nProving
    it is not just destructive power that wins matches, both teams went into the final
    with an extremely well thought out line-up and found after thirty minutes of fighting
    that they were evenly matched against each other and unable to break the opposition\u2019s
    defence. \n\nThe final came down to an interceptor dual, which saw both teams
    field Crow class Caldari interceptors. Gunstar Zero of Band of Brothers won the
    dual against Mr Fix of ASCN; with a standard missile setup over his opponent\u2019s
    rocket launcher fitting. \n\nPleasingly, the final day saw no forfeits as all
    teams were content to roll the die and see what fate had in store for them. \n\nThe
    Second Round opened with The Five defeating Veritas Immortalis; who suffered a
    warp drive malfunction for the second successive match as their Basilisk emergency
    warped out of the arena. Mercenary Coalition defeated 3rd Front Alliance, whilst
    ASCN changed their cruiser to combat The Red Skull\u2019s tactics and held on
    for a time-out victory. \n\nStain Empire continued their destructive approach
    to the tournament and destroyed Kaos Empire to set-up a quarter-final match against
    ASCN. Stain- Alliance managed a time-out victory over Lotka Volterra after the
    latter opted to change their line-up in an attempt to counter SA\u2019s long range
    webification support. \n\nMorsus Mihi finally succeeded in doing what no-one else
    had done in the tournament and broke SMASH Alliance\u2019s defenses to qualify
    for the quarter-finals. Band of Brothers outlasted Dusk and Dawn whilst Interstellar
    Alcohol comprehensively overcame Exuro Mortis despite a defender missile tactic
    by their Flycatcher pilot. \n\nIn the first quarter final match Mercenary Coalition
    bested The Five. MC\xB4s Cerberus fended off all efforts to destroy it, allowing
    his team mates to eventually find a weak link in their opponents\u2019 defence.
    The Five did not yield willingly and their Crow pilot ensured that a time-out
    had to be called by evading all efforts to destroy him. \n\nASCN advanced their
    all-Gallente line-up into the semi-finals with a timed-out victory over Stain
    Empire. While Band of Brothers defeated Stain- Alliance in their quarter final
    match. \n\nResponding to this, Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate achieved their
    own perfect victory against Morsus Mihi, who ran into difficulties once their
    Zealot pilot flew out of the support range from the rest of the team. \n\nThe
    first of the two semi-final matches saw ASCN defeat Mercinary Coalition with the
    all-Gallente support line-up of ASCN proving to be a match for MC\u2019s destructive
    power. \n\nBand of Brothers clawed back an exciting victory against Interstellar
    Alcohol Conglomerate with two vessels remaining after an early warp drive malfunction
    in BoB\u2019s Scimitar class logistics vessel and the destruction of their light
    ships suggested defeat. \n\nAfter their enthralling match against IAC, BoB went
    on to win their second alliance tournament in an interceptor dual against ASCN
    after the final match ended in stalemate. Band of Brothers receive the Caldari
    Gaming Commission\u2019s first prize of a Wyvern class Mothership, five Chimer
    class carriers and five Navy Issue Raven class Battleships."
