    patrol received assistance from a number of resident capsuleer organisations operating
    within the Pure Blind region.   \n  \nUpon learning of the patrols intentions
    the capsuleer contingent, primarily made up of pilots from Cutting Edge Incorporated
    and Bladerunners offered their services in securing the area.   \n  \nReinforced
    by these numerous capsuleer vessels, the patrol now numbering over twenty ships,
    and led by Lt. Amlerik Raun made a clean sweep through all Mordu systems without
    encountering any problems. Oddly enough this is the first time Raun has been seen
    leading a Mordu's wing since rumours of his demotion began to circulate in the
    wake of the Legion\u2019s exodus from ORE space, though Legion officials are remaining
    tight lipped as to whether the rumours are true or not.   \n  \nReports soon came
    flooding in specifying that hostile vessels thought to be of the Ascendant Frontier,
    were disrupting traffic in the EC-P8R solar system \u2013 a known pirate hotspot
    and vital trade route for the northern fringes of space. The Legion patrol was
    quickly dispatched to investigate and dispersed the hostile forces without any
    altercation.   \n  \nCEI and Bladerunners, members of the newly founded RAZOR
    Alliance apparently share a mutual interest with Mordu's Legion in keeping the
    Pure Blind region safe, an opinion which was stated in a press release posted
    on the Gal-Net communications network on Monday. Speaking in the statement, Killgorde
    \u2013 CEO of Cutting Edge Incorporated explained that both corporations had \u201Clong
    and distinguished histories throughout the Northern and Western regions of the
    Eve\u201D and went on to say that RAZOR were \u201Cactive in securing the interests
    of a free and open Pure Blind region with a strong anti-pirate stance\u201D.   \n
    \ \nThe RAZOR Alliance seems to have earned a new friend with their actions this
    weekend, with unconfirmed reports that standings between Mordu's Legion and RAZOR
    alliance have been adjusted to reflect this apparently amiable co-existence."
