    Querious** \\- An Avatar-class titan belonging to Gaia Jane of Pandemic Legion
    was downed last night at 21:53 in the hotly contested Querious system of 49-U6U
    by combined forces from the Greater KenZoku Community (also known as the GKC),
    KenZoku, Against ALL Authorities and the allied alliances known as Stainwagon.\n\nDetails
    are sparse at present but it appears the titan had been involved in a battle in
    the system some half hour earlier, in which Gaia Jane claimed some 42 kills. She
    attempted to leave the system through a cynosural field to G-TT5V in Delve. For
    reasons yet unknown, the jump failed, and the titan was probed down and engaged
    by in excess of 100 ships.\n\nThe final blow was laid by rudg3r of BeachBoys alliance,
    flying a sniper Zealot, while Krisz Anla'Shok of HUN Reloaded then executed Gaia
    Jane's pod in his Hurricane.\n\nFurther details will be provided as they come
    in.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n#### Contemporary Accounts:\n\nCAOD - [NICE DD
