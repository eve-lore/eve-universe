    destroying the titan. The loss of this vessel is said to strike a blow to ASCN's
    logistical efforts.\n\nWhen asked if this represented a step forward for BoB against
    ASCN, SirMolle, one of the Band of Brothers\u2019 leaders, explained, \"Of course
    it does \u2026 however, it never posed any real threat, and so its impact is more
    of morale and PR value.\" \n\nCommenting on the value of titan class ships in
    alliance warfare, SirMolle referred to the jump bridge system as being \"invaluable
    for strategic purposes,\" adding that, \"it beats anything on gate camping. [The
    titan is] a tool to be used in a fleet, on its own its pretty useless.\"\n\nVirtuozzo
    of ASCN\u2019s high command commented on the loss as follows:\n\n\u201CThis particular
    ship was a symbol, granted, but for the average ASCN pilot it represents an argument
    to build more. Deep space is lawless space, but people, for the majority, strive
    for order. They will live out here, build out here, and do whatever it takes to
    survive. As such, they strive to make use of every tool and means to do so, and
    titans are the most powerful ship type around.\u201D\n\nVirtuozzo added that Ascendant
    Frontier are planning to build a second and third titan, possibly even more, despite
    the cost of these vessels."
