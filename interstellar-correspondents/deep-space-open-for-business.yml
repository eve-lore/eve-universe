- body: "The Interstellar Starbase Syndicate has recently announced its newly drafted
    contract with the well known Firmus Ixion Alliance. Their goal; the colonization
    and industrialisation of deep space.   \n  \nPublicly, the details of the contract
    are sketchy at best, but one thing is known for certain. Firmus Ixion has openly
    invited Interstellar Starbase Syndicate[ISS] member corporations to start a new
    life in FIX space.   \n  \nCount TaSessine, Chairman of the ISS had the following
    to say in reference to the company's move: \"This development is the first step
    in a new era of collaboration and industrialisation in deep space.\" When questioned
    about the company's goals, he replied, \"It is our goal to assist alliances develop
    in deep space and to see these vast territories come alive and reach their true
    industrial potential.\"   \n  \nFirmus Ixion Alliance, or FIX as they are more
    commonly known, currently claim ownership of dozens of solar systems in deep space.
    This contract with the ISS seems to be the first step in a large-scale industrialisation
    operation, which could mean the construction of many additional starbases throughout
    FIX space, providing the manufacturers of empire with the moon minerals that are
    required to build the latest ships, modules and luxury goods.   \n  \nCorporal
    Hicks, of Firmus Ixion had the following to say: \"This mix of political, military
    and financial interest has long been underway. For us, the contract with the ISS
    signals the start of a new era of expansion and wealth for Firmus Ixion and our
    citizens.\"   \n  \nThe Interstellar Starbase Syndicate is headed by an Operations
    corporation, which serves as a mediator between host-Alliances and smaller corporations
    who wish to reap the benefits of 0.0 space. When the political framework is in
    place, the individual ISS corporations run their day-to-day business alongside
    the host alliance, to their mutual benefit.   \n  \nIn military terms, the ISS
    holds a neutral stance, though it does possess a limited defensive capability
    which is provided to its member corporations via the ISS Navy Task Force. The
    organisation also operates a separate logistics division which handles deep space
    shipping.   \n  \nFor information on this development, or on either of the organisations
    involved, please contact Corporal Hicks of Firmus Ixion, or Count TaSessine of
    the Interstellar Starbase Syndicate."
