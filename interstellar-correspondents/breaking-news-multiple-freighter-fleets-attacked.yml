    SECURITY SPACE** \\- Multiple freighter fleets suffered severe losses this evening
    as massive logistical operations took place all across New Eden. The latest reports
    indicate twenty-seven freighters belonging to RAZOR Alliance [-RZR-] and SOLAR
    FLEET [SOLAR] fell victim to hot drops in separate attacks.  \n  \nThe first attack
    was reported around 20:02 when a large -RZR- logistical operation was surprised
    by Triumvirate [TRI] after bridging in to a control tower in NL6V-7, a -RZR- jump
    bridge system in Tribute. Ten freighters were destroyed in the attack while approximately
    fifteen escaped.   \n  \nJust minutes after the first -RZR- freighter imploded,
    Atlas Alliance [ATLAS] hot dropped a fleet of SOLAR freighters on a stargate in
    Great Wildlands. At last report, seventeen freighter wrecks were reported surrounding
    the gate. A number of brand new infrastructure hubs were discovered in the wreckage.
    \  \n  \nLarge scale logistical operations are expected to carry on throughout
    the night in all corners of the universe as sovereign alliances race to secure
    the new infrastructure hubs from various empire outlets. The \"ihubs\" have a
    volume of 750,000m3 and each unit costs five hundred million ISK.\n\n### GalNet
