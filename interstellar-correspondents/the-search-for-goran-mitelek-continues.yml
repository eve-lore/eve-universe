- body: "Several weeks ago a prison convoy carrying the UDI operative Goran Mitelek,
    believed to have been one of the persons responsible for the attack on the Elarel
    Rent-a-Dream Pleasure Dome last month (\u201CThe Elarel Massacre\u201D), was attacked
    en-route to the Avair Theology Council Tribunal while passing through the Ebo
    system deep in Amarr space.   \n  \nMost of the convoy was destroyed, including
    the transport carrying Goran Mitelek, and the remaining debris contained only
    unidentifiable pieces of biomass - leading authorities to suspect that Goran Mitelek
    may still be alive. Amarr security forces collaborating with CONCORD have since
    been stopping and scanning passing ships through the Domain region for any evidence
    which may lead to Goran Mitelek\u2019s whereabouts, although none has been found
    thus far."
