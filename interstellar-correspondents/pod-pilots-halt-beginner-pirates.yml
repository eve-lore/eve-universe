- body: "Late Tuesday evening a pair of Gallente brothers and pirates were cornered
    and destroyed by pod pilots, and forced to flee from the Ammold system after earlier
    engaging a pilot in the Pator system. \n\nThe brothers, Emile and Bertrand Beauvais,
    who had made a failed attempt at piracy in the Renyn and Grinacanne systems the
    previous Sunday, entered the Pator system on Tuesday evening with the intention
    of pirating as many commercial ships as was possible and escaping with whatever
    valuable cargo would fit in their holds. The brothers first target was kosmonaught,
    a pod pilot traversing the system, who was hunted down and then briefly cornered
    by the pair before escaping to the Ammold system with the brothers in close pursuit.
    \n\nThings took a turn for the worse for the Beauvais' shortly after entering
    the Ammold system however, as their prey suddenly turned on them. Aided by pod
    pilots Kata Amentis, HiRider, Tychus, kashkaisha, owntbyagarbagecan, Rakhan kane
    and DJCrimson, who were rallied to the cause via the local open communication
    channel, kosmonaught succeeded in splitting the brothers up. Emile was forced
    into the gravity well of Ammold I, where the pilots made quick work his Arazu-class
    Force Recon cruiser, and a short time later Bertrand was caught and destroyed
    outside of the Republic Military School station. The escape pods from both ships
    were able to dock at the station though, after the victorious pilots were distracted
    by offers of ransom money made by the brothers in order to prevent their pods
    from being destroyed. This small turn of fortune allowed the pair to escape with
    their lives, if not their wallets, aboard the next scheduled InterBus transport.\n\nWhilst
    travelling home on board the transport and lamenting the days events, Emile commented
    \u201CAll I really wanted to do was get enough money to buy a freighter, but I
    support my brother in whatever he does.\" Bertrand responded \"I give up on all
    these crazy schemes, first it was the neo-chicken investment pyramid, now this,
    I fail at everything that's not piloting a transport ship. My brother and I are
    going back home to our father's moving company, and away from all this piracy
    nonsense.\""
