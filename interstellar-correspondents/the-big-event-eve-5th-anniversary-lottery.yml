- body: "**Place Your Bets**\n\nBIG Games are perhaps the most well known group within
    the densely packed lotteries and competition market so it should come as little
    surprise that they will be celebrating the anniversary in style. \n\nWell known
    throughout the cluster, BIG are one of the few corporations who have good relations
    with the main empires, independent factions and mega-corporations. Their many
    relationships have been cultivated over the years whilst negotiating for advertising
    and broadcasting rights. This has put them in a unique position. \n\nFor the anniversary
    lottery, round number 131, they are presenting something not seen before. BIG
    have managed to secure custom pilot equipment and memorabilia from the majority
    of their customers. These items will be given away alongside the normal lottery
    prizes. \n\nThis is an opportunity for pod-pilots, crew members and the general
    populace to own very rare custom branded equipment from BIG's sponsors, items
    potentially worth millions in the future. \n\nDo not delay. Visit BIG Games' [GalNet
    announcement](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=764361)
    for more information. \n\n**EVE 5th Anniversary**\n\nOn May 6th, we are celebrating
    our fifth birthday!!! As part of the celebrations we have donated some items to
    BIG from the EVE Store. \n\nThe Anniversary Lottery starts on the 5th and runs
    until the 18th so you have plenty of opportunity to grab yourself a ticket! \n\n_The
