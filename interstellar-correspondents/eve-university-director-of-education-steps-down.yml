    Metropolis** \\- Dierdra Vaal, Director of Education for the prestigious training
    institution, EVE University, officially stepped down from her post on March 6th.
    \ \n  \nDierdra has also served on the first, third and fifth Councils of Stellar
    Management as Councilperson, Chair and Vice-chair respectively.  \n  \nAs the
    CSM 6 candidate list is finalized, Dierdra insists that she has no current political
    ambitions and is not currently considering a future run for re-election. She has
    in fact, stated that the several years of leadership responsibilities had made
    focusing on her directorship an exacting challenge.  \n  \nEVE University CEO,
    Kelduum Revaan, offered several notes of praise on Dierdra's behalf, even claiming
    that he fully understands \"her wanting to take a break and some time to relax
    for a while\". Kelduum also confirmed that he is temporarily fulfilling Dierdra's
    former duties whiile a replacement is chosen. Although he would neither confirm
    nor deny the identity of Dierdra's replacement, he expects the new Director to
    be named publicly on March the 15th, to coincide with EVE University's 7th anniversary.
    \ \n  \nCurrently, Dierdra has not made any definite plans for her personal future,
    although she revealed that she intends to remain with EVE University while she
    considers her options. When asked if she had a favourite memory from her time
    with EVE University, she gave the following statement:  \n  \n\"It's hard to pick
    one particular fondest moment. Many times I've seen pilots join the university
    as clueless newbies and grow into pilots who command fleets or start their own
    corporations. Seeing that happen over and over is the best testament to the work
    of everyone at EVE University and shows the value of the organisation.\"  \n  \nFor
    the time being at least, Dierdra will retain the title of Professor Emeritus and
    will be readily available to advise the EVE University leadership, or lead the
    occasional course.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this article?
