    of an organized pirate expedition and its inevitable result would be the Veto.
    assault on a RAZOR corporation's mining operation deep within a wormhole.  \n
    \ \nIzo Azlion, a senior member with Veto. Corporation [VETO] reports that while
    a Veto. gang was spread out over a few systems looking for Wormholes and \"individually
    scouting them to see if we could find anything\", one of his gang happened upon
    a THE X-TRADING COMPANY Corporation [XT] mining operation.  \n  \nSmurfR, member
    of Veto., had successfully navigated through five wormhole systems before locating
    the XT mining operation, which consisted of several mining ships, an industrial
    ship, an Absolution-class command ship and a Caldari Navy Issue Raven-class battle
    ship. After notifying the rest of his corporation, he returned back to the Mannar
    System and waited for reinforcements before heading back in.  \n  \nTravelling
    through five wormhole systems, each one potentially closing behind their fleet
    was not to be taken lightly, remarked Izo, adding that \"most if not all of our
    ships that go through the wormholes are at least equipped with a Core Probe Launcher;
    we've read the stories of the lost pilots, and we try to avoid that happening
    to us!\"  \n  \nAccording to Izo, the Veto gang, which consisted of five force
    recon ships, a heavy interdictor and an interceptor were, \"thanks to our scout,
    able to land 'spot on' in the middle of them \u2026before they knew what hit them,
    we had a [heavy interdictor] bubble up from the Broadsword.\"  \n  \nAlthough
    expecting some trouble from the two combat ships, Izo was surprised to discover
    that \"the combat ships were, for some bizarre reason, fitted with ore harvesting
    equipment.\"   \n  \nAfter taking out every ship except for the Caldari Navy Issue
    Raven, Izo reports that they offered the pilot a chance to ransom his ship. Gohlem,
    an officer with [XT], confirms that an offer to ransom the ship for 600 million
    ISK was made by Veto., but stated that \"we never trade with pirates.\" Ultimately,
    no compromise could be agreed on, and both the ship and the pilot's pod were destroyed.
    \ \n  \nGohlem concedes that due to four wormholes opening into their home system
    that day, [XT] did not have all of the entry points covered and so; \"we were
    so much easy fish for that Veto. gang.\" However, according to Gohlem, this incident
    has completely changed XT's security protocols.  \n  \nIzo reports that his corporation
    did not target [XT] ships in particular, only that \"they were unfortunate enough
    to just be there at the wrong time\" adding that upon seeing the mining fleet,
    his gang felt that they had to \"crack them open to see what was inside.\"\n\n
