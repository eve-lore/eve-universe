- body: "Lately, the Intergalactic Summit on GalNet is the source for a relatively
    new group of people, the posthumanists. One of these people, Kaleigh doyle, has
    erected a political party, and is currently trying to run for Gallente President,
    a candidacy that has not yet been confirmed or denied.   \n  \nI have had the
    opportunity to send her a short list of questions, on her party ideals.   \n  \n**In
    the past, you have been mostly associated with public actions surrounding the
    Glamour Bunnies, as well as feeding and housing the homeless.** **How did these
    efforts inspire you become a politician?**   \n  \nRecent complications with Federation
    authorities regarding our employment program, coupled with a lack of genuine interest
    by the presidential candidates towards the needs of the pod pilot community has
    inspired me to seek representation in the government. As a progressive reformer
    and passionate humanitarian, I believe we need a candidate that\u2019s willing
    to lead this nation towards the future, not into the dark abyss of bureaucracy
    and incompetence. **Could you explain to us briefly what the posthumanist party
    represents?**   \n  \nThe Posthumanist Party stands for the progression of freedom
    and individuality with a focus on visionary ideals and the technological advancement
    of our society. We also seek adequate representation for the pod pilot community
    and an active voice in the governing bodies of the Federation. We feel that our
    significant contribution to the prosperity of the interstellar economy of the
    entire nation merits such a voice.   \n  \n**How do you feel posthumanism is relevant
    to the billions of planet bound citizens, who haven't the means to enjoy it's
    fruits?**   \n  \nThe primary focus of the Posthumanist Party is not only for
    the proper representation of the pod community, but to elevate the technological
    capabilities of our people to make them accessible to the countless billions that
    strive daily throughout the Federation. To do so requires the government to facilitate
    an environment conducive to technological growth, as opposed to bureaucratic expansion
    or pursuing personal agendas.   \n  \n**In this election, three candidates are
    running for Presidency. Can you explain where your party programme differs, and
    what your opinion is on their views?**   \n  \nOur chief responsibility is to
    encourage the availability of high technology goods made more readily accessible
    to the average Gallente citizen by enticing planet bound corporations to invest
    in interstellar trade and increasing the economic infrastructure of the Federation.
    This includes a 500% increase in capsule pilot training and government subsidizing
    of the high tech sector to encourage growth.   \n  \nAnd as for the programs of
    the current Presidential candidates, I feel Suoro Foiritan\u2019s push for increased
    government autonomy of regional entities and championing CONCORD as a diplomatic
    effort is wise, but even his charisma can\u2019t hide the incompetence of his
    last term. I fully support Mr. Autrech\u2019s desire to promote interstellar trade,
    but we also need a strong visionary leader that\u2019s willing to take risks and
    challenge the system, and Eman is definitely not that leader. I also agree with
    Mentas Blaque\u2019s push for an increase in navy funding to supplement interstellar
    trade, but funding needs to be derived by trimming the government bureaucracy,
    not from CONCORD. His isolationist and xenophobic tendencies add a dangerous element
    to the fragile peace between our nations, and threaten to tear our nation apart
    once more with the Intaki people.   \n  \n**For whom will you be voting, should
    your candidacy not be accepted, and why?**   \n  \nI would encourage all pod pilots
    who believe in the ideals of the Posthumanist Party to exercise their right to
    not vote should we be excluded from the presidential elections, and refrain from
    accepting the bribes and promise of political favor from the existing candidates,
    as it merely encourages them to deny us the proper representation we deserve.
    The establishment needs to know we aren\u2019t its lapdogs, and we demand our
    voice be heard.   \n  \n**In closing, do you have anything to say to the public?**
    \  \n  \nThe Federation and its people deserve a strong President to lead them
    into the future, and that future lies with the posthuman community and technological
    affordability for the masses. Our goal is to present a candidate that not only
    reflects the needs of the pod pilot community, but to every citizen in this great
    nation. Too long has the stale political machine rumbled to its own agenda as
    its citizens suffer from lack of support. Too long has our proud democracy atrophied
    at the hands of apathetic elitists that buy their way to power.   \n  \nI have
    the vision and I want to lead the Federation into the future.   \n  \nSo here
    you have it. Kaleigh Doyle and the Posthumanist Party are ready to lead the pod
    pilot and planet-bound population towards the future, hand-in-hand. Wether or
    not she will succeed in her bid for presidency remains to be seen. We look forward
    to new developments."
