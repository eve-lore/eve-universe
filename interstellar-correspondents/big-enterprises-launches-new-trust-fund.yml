    on the challenge, there are those who eventually wish to set down the banner of
    war, pursue other paths, and possibly even retire. To this end, a new branch of
    the wildly popular BIG Enterprises has been unveiled, aimed at passing on a retired
    capsuleer's greatest assets to his friends so that they may flourish after his
    departure.   \n  \nBIG Trust Fund is offering to become the keeper of a pilot's
    extremely valuable advanced technology blueprints and will continue to develop
    and manufacture the items for a profit. In return the benefactor may list a few
    people as their beneficiaries, who will then receive a percentage of the money
    made every month. However there are a few conditions, the largest being that it
    is not possible to recover the blueprints at a later date.   \n  \nWhen asked
    why such a strict rule set was developed regarding the assets, BIG responded that
    security was number one, and in a universe of clones and doppelgangers BIG could
    never truly be sure they were handing assets off to the right person.   \n  \n\"I
    can say... that they are as safe, and handled in the same way as our own stock
    of valuable BPO's,\" assured BIG CEO TornSoul.   \n  \nIn regards to the viability
    of such an enterprise in a very untrusting universe, where thievery and espionage
    run rampant, TornSoul was supremely confident that BIG has built a name and reputation
    over the years that people will trust. While he was unable to provide specifics
    about how the assets were handled, he assures that the proprietors have just as
    much to gain as the beneficiaries, ensuring maximum effort.   \n  \n\"It's greatly
    satisfying when a BIG gamble pays off - I think most in New Eden can identify
    with that,\" stated TornSoul who also referenced the success of The BIG Deal and
    The BIG Lottery among other BIG ventures. \"And being a trailblazer, seeing others
    pick up the ideas and often improve and expand on them is very satisfying as well.\"
