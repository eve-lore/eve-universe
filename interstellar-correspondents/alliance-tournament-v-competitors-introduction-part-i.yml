- body: "The **Fifth Alliance Tournament** is almost upon us. This year's entrants
    include a number of new, smaller and mostly unknown alliances as well as the established
    tournament veterans. Over the next few articles the Interstellar Correspondents
    would like to give you a brief introduction to a selection of the alliances taking
    part. \n\nThis article will introduce _**HUN Reloaded, The Star Fraction** and
    **Pandemic Legion**_\n\n**HUN Reloaded (RAX)**\n\n* * *\n\nRAX was formed in April
    109. Consisting of a small core group of corporations led by HUN Corp. \n\nThe
    Fourth Alliance Tournament saw their debut in the competition. Despite GalNet
    observers not expecting them to progress far, they only lost one match during
    the group stages and came top of their group. A good performance saw them conquer
    Atlas Alliance and The Five to reach the tournament final. After a battle with
    Pandemic Legion, RAX was crowned the tournament champions. \n\nThe original draw
    for this years tournament did not feature the defending champions, allegedly due
    to some to oversight on the part of the organisers. However, when one of the other
    teams was withdrawn by the organisers, HUN Reloaded were given a chance to defend
    their title. \n\n**The Star Fraction (-SF-)**\n\n* * *\n\nFormed in January 107,
    SF describe themselves as an \"Alliance of Free Captains and Revolutionary Heroes
    committed to opposing the spread of imperialist memetics and territorial exclusion
    across the...cluster.\" With Jericho Fraction at the core and old friends in Stimulus
    inside the Alliance presumably for the duration of the tournament, they'll be
    bringing the same faces to the fights as previous years. \n\nSF have been in a
    couple of tournaments so far. Last year they made it to the quarter finals and
    were knocked out by eventual finalists Pandemic Legion. \n\nDuring the Fourth
    Alliance Tournament SF claimed the biggest 'scalp' and caused a memorable upset
    by besting three-time champions the Band of Brothers, dominating them with a 10-Thorax
    gang. \n\nTheir success against Ascendant Frontier in the previous year's tournament
    has given the group a certain \"giant killer\" mystique and many will be watching
    to see if they live up to it again this year. \n\n**Pandemic Legion (-10.0)**\n\n*
    * *\n\nPandemic were formed in January 109 and currently consists of eight corporations
    led by Sniggerdly. \n\nLast year they came top of their group, beating THE R0NIN
    and GoonSwarm to the top spot. They then went on to beat Interstellar Alcohol
    Conglomerate and The Star Fraction before losing to HUN Reloaded in the final.
    \n\nWith a strong performance last year many GalNet observers will be monitoring
    their progress. \n\n* * *\n\n_More coverage will be available live during the
    tournament. HUN Reloaded will have its first fight on Day Two against RONA Alliance.
    On Day One, The Star Fraction will face Molotov Coalition and Pandemic Legion
    will face Brutally Clever Empire._"
