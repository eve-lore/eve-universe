    a notorious haven in New Eden for scamming. Being the primary trade hub within
    New Eden, capsuleers come to Jita with the intention of buying or selling items,
    and some capsuleers fall foul of varied and crafty scams.  \n  \nThere is the
    most common form of scam; offering to \"double your ISK\" by claiming to send
    you twice the amount you send them. Some scammers will send back double of small
    amounts of ISK in the hopes that you will send back larger amounts for doubling
    after your 'test'. Needless to say, larger amounts will undoubtedly not be doubled
    and sent back.  \n  \nOther common Jita scams include name changing; a ship offered
    in a trade window may have been named as a higher valued ship. For example, a
    Caldari Raven named as a 'Caldari Navy Raven', which the unsuspecting victim purchases
    at the inflated price only to discover the error after the trade is complete.
    \ \n  \nAn uncommon scam involves courier contracts to unsafe stations; the destination
    for the courier contract is usually set for those similar to the ones in high
    security empire space such as the \"Caldari Navy Assembly Plant\" and they offer
    a large reward but an even larger collateral. The unsuspecting capsuleer accepts
    the contract assuming it is a high security courier contract for a large reward,
    only to find out that the station in question is a capsuleer alliance outpost
    in 0.0 space, intentionally named after a high security station to lure capsuleers
    in.  \n  \nOne capsuleer has managed to outwit the architect of the most recent
    scam and make some ISK out of it.  \n  \nCapsuleer Kadra explains the latest scam;
    \"These individuals create a sell contract for (usually) obscure tech 2 rigs or
    other items which are considered useless and thus neither produced nor traded.
    It is safe to assume that such items in the hands of capsuleers in New Eden number
    only in the handfuls. They [then] massively overcharge for these items.\"  \n
    \ \nThe scam typically involves the production of these items for the approximate
    price of 20M ISK. The scammer then offers these items at a much inflated amount,
    such as five for 600M ISK. The rarity of these items on the market make it appear
    as though the capsuleers of New Eden are getting a deal on seldom found items.
    \ \n  \nTo further the illusion, the scammers would then fill the market with
    inflated buy and sell orders, showing a seemingly distinct margin for good profit
    by any unsuspecting capsuleer.  \n  \nUnfortunately, in many cases capsuleers
    find that they are unable to sell back their recently purchased items for the
    profit as Kadra explains; \"the minimum quantity (an often overlooked attribute)
    on the market buy order is larger than the volume they are selling in the contract,
    so the person falling for their scam is unable to sell them back the said items.\"
    \ \n  \nKadra also explained to us how to successfully avoid the scam and make
    ISK off the back of these scammers; \"Once seeing which items the scammers are
    using to scam with, to go and invent and produce the tech 2 rigs and thus catch
    them when they are most vulnerable, by filling that buy order they have put up.\"
    \ \n  \nThere can be many profitable deals to be found in Jita as a capsuleer,
    however if it looks too good to be true, it probably is.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected
