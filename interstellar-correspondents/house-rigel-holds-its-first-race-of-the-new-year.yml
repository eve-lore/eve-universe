    of skill, courage, and even some carnage, as capsuleers at the **House of Rigel**
    frigate race crossed space on a track named  'Inferno'. \n\nFor a 1 million ISK
    entry fee, pilots from all over New Eden put their names and ships on the line
    in a competition that was designed to be about skill and not simply technology.
    With only Frigate class vessels allowed fitted with nothing but basic modules,
    pilots were severely limited in the outfitting of their ships.\n\nThere were plenty
    of prizes worth racing for with the top three being;\n\n\\- 90 million ISK\n\n\\-
    a Shadow Serpentis Warp Disruptor anonymously donated\n\n\\- 10 million ISK courtesy
    of House Rigel\n\nThe track itself had been designed by **Julius Rigel** and was
    roughly 240 km in length with 5 turns, one of which was a surprise hairpin that
    really set the racers on edge. House Rigel places a great deal of importance on
    the opinions of the racers, using feedback to create ever more exciting tracks.\n\n**Laxyr**
    won the day in his Vigil, traveling at speeds in excess of 4,000 km/s and pulling
    out the stops to bring it all the way home. Out of more than a dozen pilots vying
    for top position, he was able to efficiently weave through the turns with enough
    speed and skill to outrun his competitors. In second place was **Kirzath** with
    a respectable top speed of 4,141 km/s, the highest in the race flying an Executioner.
    Third place was won by **Stovetop Cookie** in a Condor.\n\n**Adrena Tirkuni**
    was destroyed by a squad of CONCORD Battleships for reasons unknown, and thus
    automatically disqualified.\n\nIn their announcement pertaining to the competition,
    House Rigel revealed why they went through all the trouble of setting up such
    races, stating:\n\n 'Why? For fun silly...'\n\n \n\nFor further information on
