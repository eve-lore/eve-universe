    The Citadel** \\- Late last year, Julius Rigel, CEO of Sub-warp Racing Venture
    [SRV], vanished from the public eye. He has recently re-emerged and has revealed
    the latest season of SRV's flagship series, Impulse Con.  \n  \nFor several months,
    there was no word from SRV regarding future events after the cancellation of the
    fourth season of Impulse Con. Rigel has now apparently returned for good and is
    making public appearances to promote Impulse Con YC 113.  \n  \nOn the matter
    of his disappearance, Julius has respectfully declined to comment and instead
    chose to simply offer assurances that any party affected by the cancellation of
    the fourth season will be fully reimbursed. When it comes to former participants
    he said: \u201CI am hoping they will understand the circumstances and that it
    will not deter them from participating in future events.\u201D  \n  \nOn March
    the 5th, 6th and 7th in the Ikao system, the first set of three \"informal\" races
    got underway to promote the re-establishment of the league. According to Julius,
    the events were successful, as \"newcomers and veterans alike were able to claim
    some prizes\".  \n  \nThe SRV offers both cash prizes and assorted market goods,
    including ships, to the pilots who prove to be the fastest in New Eden. All proceeds
    are funded by private donations and through the sponsorship of pilots and racing
    teams. Eventually, Julius hopes to establish SRV-officiated betting in order to
    make the league a self-sustaining entity.  \n  \nImpulse Con YC113 has been officially
    set for April 10th. Julius wished to make capsuleers aware that, \"like last year
    there will be a series of events. Including manual flight lessons, drag racing
    and a newcomer race, as well as a circuit race to start off the new season\".
    The invitation to participate as a racer is open to anyone who wishes to register.\n\n###
