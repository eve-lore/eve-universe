- body: "49-U6U, Querious \n\nThe Interstellar Correspondents have investigated reports
    of a major fleet engagement involving a Titan class starship belonging to Evolution
    of the Band of Brothers alliance along with over 800 other ships in the system
    49-U6U, the sovereignty of which is held by Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate.
    \n\nThe Doomsday weapon on the Avatar, piloted by Shrike, was fired three times
    over the course of a conflict that saw Band of Brothers heavily out gunned, Coalition
    rivalries break out in fighting, the destruction of many hundreds of star ships
    and what is believed to be an unexplained solar event. \n\nEvents started when
    a fleet belonging to Band of Brothers was spotted in the region and became engaged
    in the systems surrounding 49-U6U including 4-07MU and 25S-6P. The Titan jumped
    into 49-U6U and fired its doomsday weapon at the 4-07MU star gate, \"killing maybe
    20 to 30\" according to VileLust who spoke to us on behalf of the alliance Interstellar
    Alcohol Conglomerate. Following this, a single Heavy Interdictor managed to tackle
    the Titan, keeping it pinned to the star gate. \n\nWord was sent to the Coalition
    forces that the ship was held in the system and ships from the entire of the southern
    universe started heading towards the action. EmpO3 of Quantum Industries, a member
    of Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate, commented \"The order I gave was to bubble
    and point Shrike with Heavy Interdictors, while targeting Band of Brothers in
    this order; support, fighters, capitals, Shrike. The Band of Brothers fleet was
    starting to take heavy losses and we were clearly going to win the battle, especially
    as there were more GoonSwarm, Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate, Red Alliance,
    Against ALL Authorities, Knights Of the Southerncross, Imperial Republic Of the
    North and other blue forces moving into system\". \n\nA representative of Band
    of Brothers High Command stated \"For 3 hours and 30 minutes Shrike was pinned
    down on the gate. Several unconventional alliances where made at that point, like
    Mercenary Coalition showing up fully blue with their 'arch enemies' such as GoonFleet,
    Against ALL Authorities and Red Alliance\". The Titan's Doomsday device was fired
    twice more during the battle, while numbers eventually reached over 800 ships
    with Band of Brothers outnumbered at approximately 1:9. \n\nAs more ships were
    preparing to join the assault, what is believed to be an unexplained solar event
    occurred that instantly caused all ships in the system to suffer an electrical
    malfunction, resulting in them disengaging and leaving the battlefield. Some ships,
    including Shrike's Avatar did not return, putting an end to the bulk of the fighting.
    \n\nAs soon as other ships had returned however, differences between members of
    the Coalition turned hostile when fire was exchanged with members of Knights Of
    the Southerncross. VileLust stated \"As a direct result of issues after the fight,
    IAC set KoS alliance red, and removed them from the system\". This was apparently
    due to \"failure to follow rules of engagement in our space\". When asked to comment,
    shnooker, CEO of Hounds Of War, part of Knights Of the Southerncross, said \"Interstellar
    Alcohol Conglomerate hunted me down ... and podded me while they were blue\".
    He furthered this, saying that they were attacked \"in order to damper the loss
    of the Band of Brothers' Titan\". \n\nBoth the Band of Brothers and Interstellar
    Alcohol Conglomerate representatives agreed that the fighting that occurred here
    is unlikely to change the state of play in the region; how this conflict will
    pan out remains to be seen."
