- body: "Several days ago, Amarr loyalists led by Rodj Blake traveled to Pator to
    urge the Minmatar leadership to restrain from violence. The pleas were not heeded
    as evidenced by the recent Minmatar attack on the Amarr Empire at Mekhios. The
    Imperial Navy was able to force the invaders from the Kor-Azor Region of the Amarr
    Empire and Derelik Region of the Ammatar Mandate.\n\nBlake, CEO of PIE Inc., [issued
    a Statement](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=793435&sid=398305376)
    on the matter \u201CI have no idea why they would attack us other than that they
    are bloodthirsty savages. The purpose of our operation to Pator was to attempt
    to get them to step back from the brink,..that appears to have failed.\u201D\n\nShortly
    after the attack, scores of pilots including PIE Inc., promptly joined the 24th
    Imperial Crusade Militia in a show of dedication to the Amarr Empire. Under Blake\u2019s
    leadership, the efforts of PIE have been mainly focused on the movement of supplies
    into their current theater of operations for rapid resupply of the militia.\n\n\u201CI
    call upon my countrymen to join us in this war. Many Amarrians have left the Empire
    to pursue other interests. To them I say this: now is the time to return home,
    become a minister of death and bring revenge for this unprovoked attack to the
    heart of the servants of the Demon.  \n  \nIn the days ahead, the Empire will
    need every Amarrian. No, it will need every person who believes that unprovoked
    offensive war is a sin against everything civilized. We need everyone who believes
    that the savage nature of the Matari attacks deserves justice to join us in ending
    this threat to peace and the Amarrian people.\"\n\nKarn Mithralia, spokesman for
    Ushra'Khan, responded to the statement made by PIE:\n\n\"For the Amarrian Empire
    as a whole to talk of peace is laughable at best and nothing more than an attempt
    to deflect eyes away from the real issues \u2013 the enslavement of our people.
    For Pie Inc., an Amarrian Para-military, to do so is even more laughable \u2013
    they exist purely to bring war to our people and protect the institution of slavery.\n\n\"Any
    one with eyes to see can spot the inconsistencies in this statement \u2013 PIE
    invaded Matari soil (as they have done for years), came to our very home-system
    and engaged in warfare. How they can then see this as a peace mission is beyond
    me. Delusional at best, bloody minded warmongering at worst.\n\n\"Violence begets
    violence; if they truly wanted us to \u2018step back from the brink\u2019 they
    would have stayed home and released slaves into our care. Do not be deceived by
    their worm tongues, they seek nothing more then the \u2018reclamation\u2019 of
    our entire race.\"\n\nKarn also had this to say about recent events and militia
    activities:\n\n\"We\u2019re overjoyed at the appearance of Elders and the events
    that unfolded over the last few days. Not only have our people risen but the whole
    \u2018verse can now clearly see exactly what the Amarrian regime represents. The
    cruelty and scale of their reprisals can leave no one with any doubts as to what
    the ways of Amarr bring \u2013 tyranny and oppression for all.\n\n\"Moreover,
    they have the audacity to call Ushra'Khan murders.\n\n\"The Ushra\u2019Khan is
    pleased to see so many of our brothers and sisters go to war. My only disappointment
    is that Concord was not destroyed in its entirety, once more we are forced to
    fight our wars as sanctioned by their rules. Rules that keep alliances such as
    the Ushra\u2019Khan on the outside as best they can, rules that only appease the
    Amarrians and protect the institution of slavery.\n\n\"Now we must face permanent
    barring from high security empire space just to fight beside our brethren. Despise
    this situation as we do, we gladly give up such freedoms for the liberty of our
    people - indeed for freedom for all.\n\n\"Ushra\u2019Khan have started \u2018Operation
    Defiance\u2019 and mobilized to Auga right on the border between Minmatar and
    Amarrian space. We are in discussion with corporations flying under the Matari
    Militia flag and members of the Tribal Liberation Force to determine how we can
    best work together. We have already destroyed many slaver vessels and will destroy
    many more as we find our feet in this new theatre of war.\""
