- body: Delegates from the Inter-Galactic Agent-Rights group met recently with CONCORD
    officials to present their candidate for Interstellar Reporter. Agents throughout
    known space have long sought to more broadly express their concerns and the opportunities
    they provide to the adventurous pilots of EVE. Now, it seems, they will get that
    wish, for it is with pride that I, Coronach, their candidate, accept CONCORD appointment
    to the position of Interstellar Reporter. I look forward to serving CONCORD, the
    pilots, and the agents of EVE, as a reliable source of useful information. I hope
    to keep you abreast of new developments in science and technology, in the markets,
    and in the world of corporate and faction agents. I invite those with related
    data, rumours, or observations to contact me, as well as anyone who needs to be
    heard. Thank you, and take care, out there.
