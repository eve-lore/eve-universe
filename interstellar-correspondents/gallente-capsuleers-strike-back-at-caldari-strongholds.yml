    NEWS - After successfully pushing the Caldari out of Covryn, the Gallente just
    hours ago announced the capture of Murethand as they continue their push against
    the Caldari held systems.  \n  \nAfter Murethand fell, Julius Foederatus, a Luminaire
    General within the Federal Defence Union [FDU] stated the reason he believed the
    Caldari have been pushed out of Covryn, and now Murethand: \"[It was] an incredible
    amount of hard work put in over the past few days and persistence of FDU plexers
    for the past few months.\"  \n  \nThe attack was conducted under two fleets. One
    of which was lead by Zagamesh, while the other was led by Julianus Soter. Some
    assistance was recieved by the Minmatar corporation Invicta as well.  \n  \nThe
    FDU concentrated their attacks while the Caldari capsuleers are focused elsewhere
    on Minmatar strong points. Val Erian, an FDU capsuleer stated that \"The Caldari
    did leave forces behind to control the situation, but these were insufficient.\"
    \ \n  \nThere have now been two quick captures by the FDU against the Caldari
    strongholds and Julius Foederatus states that it won't stop with Murethand: \"We'll
    continue pressing our Caldari foes until they've paid for all the humiliation
    and aggression they've shown us.\"  \n  \nThe FDU are pushing further into Caldari
    space as Caldari capsuleers continue to concentrate on Minmatar targets. With
    both sides advancing, more systems are expected to change hands quickly.  \n  \nThe
    Interstellar Correspondents will bring you more news on this as it unfolds.\n\n*
