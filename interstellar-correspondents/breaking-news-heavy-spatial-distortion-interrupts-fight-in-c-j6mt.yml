    to pilots flying in the area, the severe disturbance rendered it impossible to
    coordinate fleets during the fight. As a result, the fight between ATLAS, Against
    All Authorities and their allies battling against White Noise, Red Alliance, XiX
    and Pandemic Legion, was interrupted.  \n  \nAbout 20 supercapital vessels and
    5 titans were present in close proximity of the 78-0R6 gate in C-J6MT.  \n  \nMany
    veteran capsuleers blame the presence of such huge vessels in confined quarters
    as the cause of the severe disturbance.  \n  \n\"Both sides had pretty even numbers,
    and it should have been a great fight, but no one could really shoot anything
    by the end,\" said Jean Dessaut of ATLAS.  \n  \nThe fight for C-J6MT will likely
    continue in the near future. It is the second time in a short period that ATLAS
    was forced to defend the system, which is regarded as a sort of \"motherland\"
    by several other alliances.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this
