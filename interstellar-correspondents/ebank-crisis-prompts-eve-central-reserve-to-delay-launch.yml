    \ \n  \nThe announcement came after ECR's board of directors decided that the
    market's turmoil due to EBANK's crisis may overshadow the launch phase of their
    new service.  \n  \nGrendell confirmed that ECR's opening has been postponed,
    adding that its staff will use this time to improve security on the bank's procedures:
    \"it is something needed due to the current state of the secondary market,\" he
    said.  \n  \nLadyOfWrath added that ECR will gauge capsuleers' reactions to the
    present crisis to improve the bank's procedures, provide more transparency and
    ultimately reassure the public: \"we want fact and figures available at all times,\"
    was her comment.  \n  \nCustomer trust in financial ventures has been badly shaken
    by the recent events. Seraph Castillon, a former EBANK customer, admits that he
    would not deposit ISK again: \"the risk is too high for what you get out of it,\"
    he explained.  \n  \nIt is still unknown whether ECR's quest for trasparency will
    prompt a positive answer by the market: \"separation of investment by risk is,
    we hope, going to be well received,\" concluded Selene D'Celeste.\n\n \n\n* *
