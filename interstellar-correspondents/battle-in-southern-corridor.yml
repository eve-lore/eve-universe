- body: "On the evening of the 25th, Against ALL Authorities alliance engaged a mixed
    fleet including members of Paxton Federation, Curatores Veritatis Alliance, Interstellar
    Alcohol Conglomerate, and Sev3rance in SV5-8N. Reports indicate that as many as
    five -A- titans were involved. \n\nHED-GP is considered the beginning of the southern
    route from empire space into the regions of Catch, Stain, Esoteria and Paragon
    Soul; any alliance holding the corridor can wreak havoc on supply lines for other
    alliances. With SV5-8N only one jump from HED-GP, -A- had decided that the presence
    of a Paxton Federation control tower and possible jump bridge was too much of
    a threat to their supply lines. As one anonymous -A- pilot said \u201CI don\u2019t
    think it is in our best interests to allow a hostile group of this size to have
    a jump bridge near our logistics portal.\u201D \n\n[![Bubbled Gate](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2272/8gatethumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F2272%2F8gate.png)\n\nAlthough
    Paxton owns the tower, several allies were called in to assist with the defense.
    When asked about his thoughts on -A-\u2018s attack, a CVA pilot remarked \u201CIt\u2019s
    not theirs and we will defend whenever needed.\u201D Apple Boy from IAC shared
    a similar sentiment, \u201CCVA and Paxton asked for our help, we\u2019re helping\u2026
    that and it\u2019s going to be one hell of a fight.\u201D \n\nDespite severe spatial
    disruptions affecting navigational and weapon control, over 450 pilots attempted
    to do battle. The fight was split between conventional ships at the stargate to
    F9E-KX and capital ships at the tower. Although the allied fleet sustained heavier
    casualties at the stargate, the capital ship fight at the tower was more evenly
    matched. \n\nEarly battlefield reports indicate 17 -A- dreadnoughts lost, and
    14 allied dreadnoughts plus 3 carriers lost as well. Three -A- titans on the scene
    were not used, but two in a neighboring system successfully destroyed part of
    an allied battlegroup on its way to SV5-8N. \n\nWith the successful destruction
    of the tower, the -A- fleet immediately left both battlefields."
