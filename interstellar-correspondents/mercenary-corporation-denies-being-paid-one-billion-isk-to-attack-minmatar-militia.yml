    Heimatar -** According to Tribal Liberation Front corporation, Hoplite Brigade,
    former Mercenary Coalition corporation Sharks With Frickin' Laser Beams [FRICKS]
    were hired  to declare war on prominent Minmatar Militia corporations. Core Impulse
    deny the allegation.   \n  \nAccording to duct tayp, a capsuleer of Hoplite Brigade
    [HPLT] and a member of the Minmatar Republic, FRICKS were paid  one billion ISK
    by Core Impulse [CORIM] to help in the faction warfare.   \n  \nHe said, \"From
    what I understand, Core Impulse had paid Sharks With Laser Beams quite a sum to
    wardec a majority of the better FW corporations.\"   \n  \nAfter what duct tayp
    describes as a \"failure\" by [Underworld Excavators](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1347653)
    to get involved after they were beaten back in Auga, CORIM and other 24th Imperial
    Crusade corporations turned to FRICKS for help.   \n  \nDunn Idaho, of CORIM,
    said that CORIM never hired mercenaries to help them and expressed the belief
    that they are not needed. \"My opinion in this matter is that mercenaries are
    not needed around here, at least not for aiding the Amarr milita as we're more
    than capable of dealing with anything the other militas can throw at us.\"   \n
    \ \nTixxie Lix, a capsuleer in FRICKS denied that they took one billion ISK from
    CORIM: \"I received some mails from folks saying that one of the corps thought
    we wardec'ed them to help out another Minmatar FW corporation.\"   \n  \nTixxie
    claimed that FRICKS simply \"decided to randomly wardec juicy Minmatar FW corporations,\"
    but decided to leave the war after just three days as, according to Tixxie they
    only got \"one or two kills.\"   \n  \nIn a final twist to the story, an anonymous
    source in Underworld Excavators admitted that they had been paid by a third party
    to attack a Minmatar corporation. When asked whether they believed FRICKS would
    have been paid, they only said, \"Maybe.\"   \n  \nDuct tayp remains convinced
    of a payment being made and has his own summary of why it went wrong: \"Long story
    summarised: Amarr militia pays [FRICKS] one billion isk. [FRICKS] attempt but
    fail to destroy minmatar ships. Amarr is upset about performance of their contract.
    Amarr militia takes revenge by attacking the mercenaries.\"   \n  \nTypically,
    unless explicitly instructed by an employer to deny being on contract at all,
    mercenary corporations will state they are on a contract but not by whom they
    were hired. Both the alleged employer, Core Impulse, and Sharks with Frickin'
    Laser Beams, the mercenary corporation in question, deny any formal contract for
    attacks on the Tribal Liberation Front, though Hoplite Brigade representatives
    are adamant that money changed hands to retain FRICKS for the attacks.\n\n* *
