    to the Alliance Tournament Team Spotlight, where we take a closer look at some
    of the teams competing in the [Alliance Tournament XIV](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/eve-online-news/alliance-tournament-xiv-schedule/).
    Today, we are looking at [Complaints Department](https://gate.eveonline.com/Alliance/Complaints%20Department)
    [P45], who are newcomers to this year's tournament.\n\n![](http://imageserver.eveonline.com/Alliance/99006045_128.png)\n\nIn
    an interview with [Frag Solo](https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Frag%20Solo)
    of Complaints Department, the capsuleer disclosed that he had previously taken
    part in Alliance Tournament XIII under the banner of Tactical Narcotics Team [TNT],
    and this factored into his decision to take Complaints Department into the tournament
    this year. \"It's a old project,\" he said. \"Last year I made the AT and we finish
    Top 12 , we won something like 120b but the alliance exec stole the winnings,
    so I planned to make my own team this year!\".\n\nFrag Solo was also anticipating
    an early matchup with Tournament heavyweights Pandemic Legion [-10.0] and didn't
    rate his team's chances particularly highly. \"At the moment it's very low ....
    we don't have excellent setup for the moment.We are still working a very strong
    setup. We know we will probably fight PL for our second round, so we don't have
    any hope on this match for the moment.\" When queried about which team he would
    like to fight against, however, he responded with Pandemic Legion, reasoning that
    to \"fight the best is a good experience\".\n\nWhen asked about his team's philosophy
    for the tournament, it appears that Frag Solo is invested in his fellow tournament
    pilots. \"My philosophy is .... I run the tournament like a business! I invest
    money and I want a pay back! My strategy is stay serious and try to have some
    fun,\" and offered a simple \"GLHF\" to the pilots and the citizens of the cluster.\n\nAdditional
