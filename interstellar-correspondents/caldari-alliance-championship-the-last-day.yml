- body: "The final battle was held yesterday at midnight between Band of Brothers
    and Kaos Empire. Before this last fight of the tournament, the two alliances both
    had to fight their way through the quarters and semi finals of the championship,
    encountering well known alliances such as Red Alliance, the Five, The R0ck and
    Tribal Souls. \n\nBand of Brothers met Tribal Souls in the quarter finals and
    quickly took out their support ships leaving only the battleship of Tribal Souls
    to stand up alone against the onslaught of missiles coming from BlackLights\u2019
    Caldari Navy Raven. The Band of Brothers won this battle with their usual tactics
    of attacking fast and removing the support with minimal losses on their side.
    \  \nKAOS Empire was destined to fight the Red Alliance during the quarters and
    it was actually the Red Alliance\u2019s second match of the entire championship.
    Both side moved towards each other when the battle started and both the battleships
    and both the heavy assault cruisers went on a 1 vs. 1. Kozak from KAOS Empire,
    flying a Navy Megathron, decided to focus his attention on the heavy assault cruiser
    which went down rapidly after that. The enemy wolf was next on their agenda leaving
    the full team of KAOS Empire to focus on the remaining Megathron of the Red Alliance
    flown by Daroh. The result was another flawless victory for KAOS Empire. \n\nIn
    the semi-finals BoB faced the pilots Tyrrax Thorrk, Homo Erectus and Jim Raynor
    who were fighting on behalf of The Rock, who were using a Crusader, a Guardian
    and a Caldari Navy Raven. In earlier rounds Tyrrax was seen flying Imperial battleships
    such as the Armageddon and Apocalypse. Tyrrax told me they switched ships because
    they expected this would be the hardest fight to win and they wanted to surprise
    BoB using a different tactic, where the Guardian and the Raven repaired each other.
    Sadly Jim Raynor activated his modules a second to late to repair Homo Erectus
    and in that time BoB took down the Guardian. Before this both teams did minimal
    damage towards each other but by missing a repair on the Guardian the Rock gave
    BoB the room to do some serious damage; an opportunity they did not waste. After
    the Guardian was downed, BoB destroyed the crusader and focused their fire on
    Jim Raynor in the Raven who was able to tank it for a few minutes until apparently
    he had run out of energy.   \nKaos Empire fought against the Five using the same
    tactic as they used throughout the championships, moving in towards the other
    team while sticking close together and help each other tank whatever the enemy
    throws at them. This time the Deimos of Kaos Empire flown by Kunming received
    all the missiles from Kayosoni in the Rattlesnake, but with the help of his teammates
    he was able to tank the damage. The only time it was a close call for the Deimos
    was when he was out of the range of Kozak who couldn\u2019t keep him repaired.
    The error was corrected swiftly, though, showing that these pilots knew what they
    were doing. KOAS ignored the rattlesnake and focused on the supporting ships of
    the Five and in the end fisho\u2019s Ishtar couldn\u2019t withstand the fire and
    was destroyed leaving Kayosoni to face the full team of Kaos Empire. Yet again
    KAOS Empire proved to be a tight team in this fight and fought their way into
    the finals with the most flawless victories of the championship \n\nBand of Brothers
    team consisted out of the same ships as their previous round, Blacklight in a
    Caldari Navy Issue, Alasse Cuthalion in an Eagle and TWD flying a Taranis. Kaos
    Empire\u2019s team remained unchanged with Kozak in a Navy Issued Megathron, Kunming
    in a Deimos and almightybig in an Ishkur. When the battle started TWD rushed in
    to remove the support of KAOS Empire, sadly he had to run away from their drones.
    The rest of BoB approached steadily, while the Megathron was tanking the Raven
    and the Eagle while trying to get into his optimal. BoB realizes this and moved
    back. After TWD had succumbed to the drones the two battleships focused on each
    other with the support of their heavy assault cruisers. Kozak\u2019s Megathron
    was destroyed in the end but the Raven from BoB followed shortly after, leaving
    only Alasse on the field against the cruiser who was half into armor and the frigate
    of Kaos Empire. Alasse focused on destroying Kunming while tanking the damage
    of his Deimos and the Ishkur. This went on for some time until Alasse surprised
    everyone by removing the Deimos successfully. The Ishkur then tried to stay out
    of range of Alasse but it couldn\u2019t outrun the missiles. BoB has won the Championship
    by sheer persistence of the Eagle pilot Alasse Cuthalion. \n\nYou can view the
    recorded holoreels of this final battle [ by going here ](\u201D), and expect
    in-depth interviews from Kaos Empire and Band of Brothers regarding their set
    up and tactics soon."
