- body: "**MOLEA** \\- A lone pod pilot tends a cemetery she has lovingly crafted
    in orbit above the planet of Molea II. The caretaker, Azia Burgi, has anchored
    over four hundred small secure caskets in distinct rows. \n\nEach casket contains
    the recovered corpse of a pod pilot, as well as an inscription identifying the
    decedent. Multiple corpses of the same pilot are \u201Cupgraded\u201D to Mausoleum
    status. Any pod pilot with a corpse in Azia\u2019s cemetery is welcome to request
    a customized inscription. \n\n\u201CI thought it was a little sad that people
    just left their victims corpses alone in space after such a violent death. I used
    to have a small cemetery of about ten or so corpses in Kor-Azor Prime. There used
    to be a ruined cathedral there but it crumbled away, then CONCORD upgraded the
    system\u2019s security status so I had to move the corpses if I wanted to keep
    adding to it. I chose Molea as the location of the new cemetery because it was
    quiet and close to my home system.\u201D \n\nA quick view of the cemetery reveals
    two distinct lines of graves: \u201COriginally I just had them in a random cloud.
    Then I decided to see if I could make the line of graves reach the planet surface.
    A friend suggested that they would prefer to be buried in the rings so I'm now
    trying to get a line to reach the rings. I haven't got around to moving the older
    cans.\u201D \n\nAzia has collected only forty of the corpses herself; the rest
    have been donated to her by sympathetic pod pilots. Although she currently has
    a backlog of over six hundred corpses to inter, she is hoping that the pod pilot
    community will continue to collect the abandoned dead of New Eden and pass them
    to her for proper care. Azia\u2019s current corporation affiliation does not allow
    anyone else to inter and anchor secure caskets on her behalf, so it remains this
    sole pod pilot\u2019s endeavor. \n\nPlease contact Azia directly for further details
    and donation instructions. \n\n_External GalNet References_   \n[Cemetary Details](http://azia.geekandproud.co.uk/docs/eve_cem.php)"
