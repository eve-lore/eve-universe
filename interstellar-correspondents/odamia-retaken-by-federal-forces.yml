- body: "After two months of occupation, the system of Odamia has been reclaimed by
    Federal forces. \n\nIn a three day operation called \u201COperation Padlock\u201D,
    members of Mixed Metaphor corporation successfully recaptured Odamia, the first
    system seized by a militia since the Emergency Militia War Powers Act was enacted.
    CEO Andreus Ixiris of MXD tells us that the heroes of the day were Dreadchain,
    Gabriel Karade, and Carlos Jaeger. These three pilots were pivotal in taking the
    control bunker in the system. \n\nThe past few months has seen a virtual stalemate
    between the State Protectorate and Federal Defense Union. Although numerically
    superior, the Caldari have only been able to seize two systems, and have consistently
    been defeated in combat. As Andreus reminds us, \u201CThe territorial losses have
    been one thing, but the ship-to-ship battles have been quite another. We've consistently
    shown more skill in that than the Caldari have. We're at an obvious numerical
    disadvantage in terms of militia members but we still have considerably more confirmed
    kills than them. That speaks highly of our boys' competence.\u201D Current statistics
    can be found [here](http://fwstats.eve-ic.net/)\n\nAndreus believes that the current
    Amarr militia push is being backed by Caldari forces. With the Caldari distracted,
    Federal forces have been able to switch from a defensive posture to an offensive
    one. Once the Caldari refocus on this region, it may be too late for them to stop
    the Federal Defense Union's momentum."
