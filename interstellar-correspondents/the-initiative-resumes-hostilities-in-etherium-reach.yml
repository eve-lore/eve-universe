    Reach** \\- The Initiative [INIT.] which had previously withdrawn from the drone
    regions conflict has re-entered the fray, sending roaming fleets to engage targets
    of opportunity amongst the Ethereal Crossing Coalition (Ethereal Dawn [ED] and
    Intrepid Crossing [IRC]).  \n  \nHaving initially withdrawn for strategic reasons
    after SOLAR FLEET [SOLAR] began engaging INIT. and Majesta Empire [ME] forces
    in DYPL-6, The Initiative. is now fully re-engaged in the fighting. However, INIT.
    is refraining from deploying any towers in the Etherium Reach Region, preferring
    to engage in ship to ship combat, as opposed to claiming space. Hasan Rachid of
    \ Mad hatters Inc. [MADH] stated, \"at this time we are acting alongside Red Alliance
    [RED], there is no need for us to anchor towers beyond the occasional staging
    tower.\"  \n  \nWith regards to the motivations behind INIT.'s current aggressive
    stance towards the Coalition, Hasan states that \" Northern Coalition and [GoonSwarm]
    wanted pressure on IRC/ED to stop invading RED space in Insmother. We are providing
    that.\" Hasan further added that, \"We have no real political agenda, although
    we are aligned with the Northern Coaltion.\"  \n  \nAsked about whether or not
    the rumor is true that INIT. is using this conflict as a covert means of securing
    a beachhead for a future invasion of SOLAR space, Hasan responded with a firm
    \"No.\"  \n  \nSince resuming hostilities Hasan states that his alliance has been
    engaging \"more IRC forces than ED\" and claims that INIT. \"probably has a 5:1
    kill/death ratio\" against the so-called Ethereal Crossing Coalition (INIT. killboard
    shows 88.28% and 50.18% efficiency against IRC and ED respectively), adding further
    \"more importantly we're getting good fights.\"  \n  \nA representative from IRC
    could not be contacted before the article went to print.\n\n### Battle Reports:\n\n[The
