    Devoid** \\- The Tribal Liberation Force captured the Ezzara system from Amarr
    hands at 22:22  on the 22.01.112. The final siege of the 24th Imperial Crusade's
    bunker in system met with little resistance.   \n  \nIn the last month, both Amarr
    and Minmatar militias have been fighting fiercely across the Devoid region, but
    when Minmatar forces recently staged an attack on the Ezzara system they allegedly
    met very little resistance.   \n  \nEzzara is adjoined to the Arzad system, home
    to [Starkman Prime](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eveonline.com/background/potw/default.asp?cid%3D11-03-05),
    the former homeworld of the recently-rediscovered Starkmanir tribe of Minmatar,
    now home to those outcast from the Republic for their ominous destiny marks. The
    planet was bombarded by a fleet of Amarrian vessels, which has left the planet
    scarred and desolate. The Minmatar still hold the celestial body dear to their
    hearts as the last known location of the Starkmanir and by taking Ezzara they
    are one step closer to securing one of their most sacred of locations.   \n  \nAccording
    to Eran Mintor of the Tribal Liberation Force-aligned Valklear Guard corporation,
    this is not a strategic victory, but rather a morale boost for his comrades. \"I
    think the major victory was retaking Lantorn, which the Amarr held for over a
    year... Their resistance has increased at an alarming rate since the recapture
    of Ezzara,\" he said. \"I do not see any stop in Valklear Guard's activities in
    the Amarrian territories at this time.\"   \n  \nBattlestar Crusader, of the Amarr
    Militia, also evaluated the present situation. \"System control little effects
    my day to day operations and those of my corp and most of the militia... At the
    moment [morale] seems rather low, we do not have enough fleet commanders and a
    severe lack of interest from the general militia hinder fleet operations.\" Battlestar
    Crusader believes the future of amarr militia is based on building a new command
    structure. \"The key corps have grouped together to draw up strategies to win
    on our own two feet rather than taking Caldari aid,\" he stated.   \n  \nThe 24th
    Imperial Crusade is still far from being critically weakened by the present turmoil.
    1st Praetorian Guard of the 24th Imperial Crusade was one of the groups that actively
    attempted to force system control over Ezzara back to Amarr hands before the bunker
    could fall. Gangleri, one of their fleet commanders, commented \"We fight them
    on a daily basis, always on the defence of our own military complexes and taking
    the offensive to hack their complexes.\"   \n  \nWhile the Minmatar were successful
    in taking the Ezzara system, Amarrians pledge to rebuild their strength and strike
    back. Both sides are still locked in combat and both aim for victory. Only time
    will tell who will prevail in this fight.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the
