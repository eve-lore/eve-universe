- body: "On the 17th of December YC119, at roughly 13:50 a Revenant supercarrier belonging
    to Mister Meseeks Lookatme was destroyed in the Providence region when it unknowingly
    cynoed into a defensive trap.\n\nProvidence is an area famed for the welcoming
    attitude residents have for new Capsuleers operating in their region. Provibloc
    residents allow unknown Capsuleers to come and go in their space freely, as long
    as they do not harm any of the residents. Despite this known policy, a small hunting
    party decided to take their chances on an attack of a mining fleet.\n\nA Sabre
    class interdictor piloted by Beautiful Thieves, found its way into the system
    of FC-3YI, a system that is known to contain a regular mining fleet. The interdictor
    pilot decided to spring a trap and thus she waited for the ideal moment. She soon
    found a freighter in the asteroid belt, supposedly picking up the jetcans from
    the mining ships, as well as a single Procurer. She moved in quickly and bubbled
    the Freighter and Procurer and then burned away to get some range before lighting
    her cynosural field to allow the Revenant to come in and destroy the ships.\n\nUnknown
    to both Mister Meseeks Lookatme and Beautiful Thieves, an interdictor belonging
    to Provibloc had been cloaked just off of the Procurer. As soon as Beautiful Thieves
    lit her cynosural field, the Provibloc interdictor decloaked and burned straight
    at the hostile interdictor and bubbled up. Thus, when the Revenant jumped in,
    it was right into a bubble.  \n\nThe Revenant immediately targeted the Provibloc
    interdictor and destroyed it, but during this, another Provibloc ship fitted with
    a cynosural field was exiting warp and a cynosural field was lit; in jumped 12
    dreadnoughts, two heavy interdictors and a single Apostle. Straight away, the
    dreadnoughts begun targeting the Revenant and lashing out with their formidable
    firepower.\n\nAt this point, realizing his mistake, the Revenant pilot called
    in a friendly Minokawa belonging to Eonan Dmalum. Lordmopp1, the fleet commander
    for the Provibloc response force ordered all neutralizers to be put on the Minokawa
    and all damage to remain on the Revenant. After just several minutes, the Revenant
    was downed and the Minokawa followed soon after.\n\nAt the end of the battle,
    Provibloc forces had lost a total of 92 million ISK while they destroyed a total
    of 167 billion ISK. The battle report can be found [here](https://zkillboard.com/related/30003718/201712171300/o/%7B%22A%22%3A%5B%22154104258%5C%2F%22%5D%2C%22B%22%3A%5B%5D%7D/)\n\nRevenant
