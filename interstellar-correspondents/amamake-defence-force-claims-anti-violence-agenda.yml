    Heimatar** -  A group of so-called vigilantes who call themselves the Amamake
    Defense Force or ADF have formed to attempt to enforce non-violence in Tama, Old
    Man's Star and Amamake. These systems are purported to be a \"hot bed\" of activity
    in inter-factional warfare. Their leader, Spectre3353, credits Helicity Boson
    for the idea, though many ADF pilots claim Spectre3353 undervalues his own role
    in their formation.  \n  \nThe ADF plans to patrol these systems with fleets of
    \"officers.\" When acts of hostility are detected, they claim they try to quell
    the violent acts in a non-lethal manner, employing various types of electronic
    warfare.   \n  \nAccording to the ADF spokesperson, Spectre3353 (also of Python
    Cartel.), fleet members are generally from the Jerk Cartel Alliance. Reports indicate
    that the ADF fly Blackbird-class electronic warfare cruisers with a mix of other
    ships. Despite the allegedly-good intentions of the ADF forces, regional law enforcement
    considers the use of electronic warfare against a ship unflagged for aggressive
    behaviour to be a hostile act, regardless of its non-lethal properties.   \n  \nUpon
    entering a system, the Amamake Defense Force claims it warns possible trouble
    makers with the following broadcast: \"All pilots must stand down and cease all
    aggression and violent actions in these systems or face the consequences\". They
    then proceed about the system scanning for trouble spots and interceding where
    they can, in what they claim is an attempt to keep the peace.   \n  \nAccording
    to Spectre335 the \"police\" operations have not yet achieved the desired goal,
    which is \"to foster a safe and friendly universe for all.\" The ADF has \"lost
    many good officers\" to hostile fire. The team is currently considering several
    new strategies including \"training and bringing in an ADF 'SWAT' team to assist
    with our inability to squash violence in our targeted systems\" and several others
    that Spectre3353 was not willing to disclose.   \n  \nMany ADF pilots were also
    involved with the spate of \"suicide kills\" associated with the [Hulkagedon events](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?article=3512).
    Spectre3353 professed a change of heart in the interim, however. \"Hulkageddon
    was a mistake. I was young and did not yet understand of the ramifications of
    my actions. I am incredibly apologetic for my role in its success.\"   \n  \nN'grasta
    of Evil Doers [ELFEN], a Federal Defence Union corporation reported an encounter
    with the ADF where-in they might have destroyed his fleet, yet they warped off
    claiming to be \"anti-pirate.\" This, he stated, made him feel that \"their claim
    is valid\" but he went on to say that he had seen many of the same pilots \"actively
    engage in [piracy] in the low-sec systems between Villore, and Nourvukaiken.\"
    As a result, he said, \"Until there is more evidence that members of the ADF are
    true to the claim that they are 'defenders of low-sec' they will be considered
    valid targets by the majority of our fleet commanders.\"   \n  \nIt remains to
    be seen if the Amamake Defence Force will hold true to its professed agenda of
    enforcing non-violent behaviour in the hotly contested systems of Tama, Old Man
    Star and Amamake, or whether the call of piracy and \"sweet, sweet... tears\"
    will prove too strong a lure. All ADF pilots involved in the operations so far
    have, however, professed great enjoyment in the activity.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[The
