- body: "Three alliances took over two outposts today in AZN-D2, Feythabolis and in
    JU-OWQ, Deklein. BoB was responsible for taking control of the outpost located
    in JU-OWQ, which was owned by IRON. G and Iron took over the ASCN outpost in AZN-D2
    after weeks of preparation. \n\nThe system AZN-D2 has been a hotspot for weeks
    and every day there were fights between ASCN and the G and IRON forces. G and
    IRON have laid siege on this system by taking over the starbases owned by ASCN
    and by building their own. It is required to have the sovereignty of a system
    before you can either build an outpost or take control of an existing outpost.
    \n\nAs Shanzem from ASCN told me they are determined to regain the control of
    the system and the outpost since the system is a tactical desired one, it joins
    two regions who are both rich in minerals, and it has been ASCN home for months.
    Shanzem: \u201CThese regions are our home. Where we live, build and prosper, we
    are Ascendant`s children and were here to look after her.\u201D \n\nG and IRON
    are pleased with their effort and satisfied with their accomplishment, but they
    pointed out that they are far from reaching their goals. Liquidism from G: \u201CAs
    I said before, this is just one step towards our goals. We\u2019re here to tackle
    and maybe destroy ASCN in the long run. The war is definitely not over.\u201D
    Liquidism also confided that G and IRON will attack other systems of ASCN until
    they are willing to negotiate about their terms of defeat. \n\nIRON did lose their
    outpost in JU-OWQ to BoB forces who have been in the system since Saturday. Fotoflame
    from IRON explained that this loss was a pre-decided sacrifice. Fi T'Zeh of Evolution
    commented in the following regarding this sacrifice: \u201CI can't comment on
    their actions, however it would seem to me unwise to leave ones house unlocked
    whilst out shopping for a new one.\u201D Fi T\u2019Zeh assured me that BoB has
    confidence in the capabilities of Xelas during BoBs absence. Fi T\u2019Zeh:\u201DWe
    see no threat there at this time. It would unwise to think that we are not keeping
    watch upon all our assets\u201D. At this moment BoB sees no reason why they should
    return to Fountain even though trouble in the form of Serpentis and supporters
    has been sighted by fellow interstellar correspondents."
