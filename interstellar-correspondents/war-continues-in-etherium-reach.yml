    Etherium Reach** \\- Fighting between the Ethereal Crossing Coalition (Ethereal
    Dawn [ED] / Intrepid Crossing [IRC]) and the Red Alliance [RED] and allies continues
    unabated throughout the region. With Red Alliance currently holding half of Ethereal
    Dawn's four stations in the 6TT8-Z constellation, or \"the loop\" as local residents
    refer to it, the outcome of this war remains uncertain. Both sides are committed
    to a fight until the end; there will be no surrender, no compromise.  \n  \nWhile
    there has been some relief to the embattled Coalition, Red Alliance forces remain
    firmly entrenched deep within Ethereal Dawn territory. Pressure was relieved on
    the Coalition when Majesta Empire [ME] and The Initiative. [INIT.] withdrew from
    the fight when SOLAR FLEET [SOLAR] appeared on the scene. The withdrawal of United
    Legion [UNL] due to the war in Immensea with [ATLAS] and Aggression. [AGGRO] alliances,
    also gave the Coalition a small respite.  \n  \nCzech Lion of Best Path Inc. [BPINC],
    a member of [ED]'s High Command, states that forces currently arrayed against
    Ethereal Dawn and Intrepid Crossing include \"Red Alliance, Voodoo Technologies
    [VIP], LUCKY LEAGUE [LUCKY], Red Army Alliance [REDAR] and Sc0rched Earth [BYRN].\"
    Additionally, while [SOLAR] did act against some of the alliances that were members
    of the Northern Coalition, it is unknown if they would enter into hostilities
    against the Red Alliance as they are currently friendly.  \n  \nAccording to Red
    Alliance fleet commander Bapp of Warriors Tribe [W.T.], forces are poised for
    the last push into Ethereal Dawn's capital system of 3H58-R: \"When ED's towers
    in that system come out of reinforced mode there will, possibly, be the final
    battle for sovereignty.\" Although Bapp would not discuss the timing of any assaults,
    he tells us that [RED] has amassed a large force including several titans in preparation
    for the taking of the system.  \n  \nCzech Lion doesn't see the loss of 3H58-R
    as anything significant; \"we will have one less grouping point and can focus
    on smaller territories, until we have the power to get it back\" Further he stated
    \"it's a typical war of attrition...but that's what we chose and people don't
    have to worry, we will stay in combat as long as necessary; it's a challenge we
    are willing to accept\".  \n  \nWhile both sides acknowledge that there has been
    a tentative offer of peace from the Red Alliance, according to Czech Lion it has
    been categorically rejected. Specifically he remarked \"the RA peace offer consisted
    of wanting to get two titans from us, which we happily denied\", adding further
    that, \"as can be seen that we are still in the fight, it is a thing of honor
    and self-respect to not just fold and be slaves. We either can defend it or not.\"
    \ \n  \nWith the rejection of their offer, Bapp signaled that there would be no
    stopping for his alliance in this war, short of completely removing the Ethereal
    Crossing Coalition from null sec, stating that, \"we already offered them safe
    way to end this war, but they said that price is too high for them and they rejected
    it. So, it seems like they want to die; we will help them in that way.\"  \n  \nOn
    this point both sides agree; there will be no peace. What started out as isolated
    border skirmishes has escalated to the level of a blood feud. Even if one side
    or the other loses their sovereignty, they are committed to the further prosecution
    of this conflict, as evidenced by Czech Lion's closing remarks \"Even if we lose
    the space, we are in this for long haul; we are going to attack their space, hit
    their infrastructure, and continue the war to kill them.\"\n\n* * *\n\nAre you
