- body: "ASHAB | Amarr Empire \n\nSinged bits of biomass lay stretched over several
    thousand kilometers of space near the Amarr gate in Ashab this morning. The lives
    of over two-hundred and thirty-thousand slaves were extinguished as Amarr freighter
    pilot Darien Dashel violently exploded under the weapons of the Electus Matari
    (-EM-). \n\nEarlier the freighter, part of a rehabilitation convoy carrying recently
    freed slaves towards new homes and lives of freedom, veered suddenly towards the
    Amarr home worlds. The pilot, under the orders of the Holders, intended to deliver
    the immense amount of newly freed citizens back into the clutches of slavery.
    \n\nThe -EM- caught up to the pilot nearing the gate to Amarr, what followed was
    a tense battle of insults, slander, appeals for decency, and all manner of negotiation.
    Having halted the freighter with various tactics the exchange of hostile words
    went on for sometime. Reportedly the freighter was hit with several warning shots,
    and attempts to _\u201Csoften the target\u201D_ in hopes of forcing Dashel to
    release the slaves, or allow the large craft to be boarded and the new citizens
    freed. Dashel gave those present only two options, _\u201CGenocide, or Slavery\u201D_\n\nThe
    situation became dire as Pilot Dashel initiated his self-destruct mechanism leaving
    the -EM- little time to act. The warning beacon active, few of the surrounding
    ships moved away to avoid being caught in the blast. However the small -EM- fleet
    drew closer and engaged, pummeling the freighter and its cargo of frightened citizens
    until the craft split apart in a sorrowful splash of light. The pod of Darien
    Dashel was quickly dispatched without ceremony, or regret. \n\nSpeaking with a
    -EM- representative it became clear that the actions of the alliance were based
    on a hope that the destruction of the ship before the self-destruct could complete
    would leave some of the cargo areas intact and allow for the rescue of the captive
    citizens. It was also evident that continued lives of slavery were not an option
    the alliance would accept. The -EM- representative continued, saying _\u201CThe
    Electus Matari are dedicated to the Minmatar Republic. This abduction and murder
    of its people in the name of Holders shall not be tolerated by the Electus Matari.
    We shall see justice met...\u201D_. A ceremony will be held in Pator the night
    following the attack at 00:00. \n\nThe wreckage, as feared, contained no survivors."
