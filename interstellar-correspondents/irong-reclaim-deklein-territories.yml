- body: "Late last week the Band of Brothers (BoB) alliance, and the Coalition of
    the Imperial Republic Of The North (IRON) together with the G Alliance, clashed
    heavily in the Deklein region, resulting in the withdrawal of BoB and the surrender
    of the system JU-OWQ and its outpost to the attacking force. \n\nIn the early
    afternoon of last Thursday a sizeable contingent of IRON, G and associated ships
    entered the JU-OWQ system under the sovereignty of BoB. Their target, a large
    control tower, had been reduced to reinforced mode the previous day, and the fleet
    was intending to finish the task and destroy the tower as part of an overarching
    attempt to reclaim the system. However this was not to be, as the attacking forces
    discovered that the tower had rapidly regenerated its shields during the short
    interim, and with the fleet ill equipped to lay siege to the tower a second time
    they instead sought battle with the system's defenders, a token force of vessels
    compared to the attacking armada. Four straight hours of battle ensued, with each
    side escalating their forces on the field on several occasions, including the
    deployment of fearsome dreadnought units. DANGEROUS, fleet commander for IRON:
    \u201CAll IRON and G forces were called to support at this stage because the number
    of ships going down on both sides was huge\u201D. \n\nThe tide finally turned
    when, due to the sheer number of enemy vessels and activity in the vicinity, two
    of the three dreadnoughts deployed by BoB suffered a catastrophic overload of
    their command circuits, rendering all of their systems inoperative. With only
    a single dreadnought remaining on the battlefield - facing the entire IRON/G armada,
    which itself included three dreadnoughts \u2013 the BoB forces retreated to the
    safety of its marshalling areas, this was too late for the remaining dreadnought
    which was destroyed. Although claiming victory over the battlefield, the result
    failed to make any impact on IRON and G's final goal \u2013 to reclaim the system
    for their respective alliances. An anonymous pod pilot remarked \u201CWe couldn't
    get superiority in the system, so we were heading back to VFK-IV\u201D. A parting
    comment from DANGEROUS summed up their general sentiment, \u201CBoB will NOT have
    a foot hold in the north for many more hours.\u201D \n\nIndeed this statement
    held true as just two days later, an even larger IRON/G fleet assembled and entered
    JU-OWQ with the intention of re-establishing sovereignty of the system and reclaiming
    the stolen outpost in the system at any cost. However the destructive and vicious
    battle IRON and G prepared for was not to eventuate, as the BoB alliance had taken
    down all but two of its Control Towers as a prelude to withdrawing from the system.
    BoB managed to evacuate the system using small fleets and freighters before the
    opposing force arrived, and the seizure of the outpost was but a formality as
    it lay undefended in IRON controlled space. Buddrow, the leader of IRON said \u201CWe
    were very effective today and we dealt a very serious blow to BoB's so called
    'road trip'. It is my belief they tagged this offensive as such to give them a
    way out when IRON and G fully returned from its southern campaign\u201D. When
    asked if the two alliances would pursue BoB deeper into its own territory, Buddrow
    answered only \u201CWell, that's tricky to answer.\u201D \n\nThe BoB alliance
    issued a single, short [public statement](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=275616):
    \u201CAs of Friday the 6th ... all our Towers were pulled down, the road trip
    is over. After nearly a month in hostile space, this is it. The Capital Age is
    coming, and we are off. For all the hostiles that wants a piece of us, you will
    find us at home\u2026\u201D. IRON and G, however, added one final statement to
    punctuate the days events \u201CA road trip? ... Nothing but an excuse to be removed
    from the theatre, because BoB was just that, removed.\u201D"
