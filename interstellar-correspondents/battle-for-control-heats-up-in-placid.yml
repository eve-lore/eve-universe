    year, a concerted effort by State Protectorate forces resulted in the [capture
    of all systems controlled by the Federal Defence Union](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?article=3113).
    This was followed by a long period of stasis as those forces which remained active
    in the FDU mostly focused on engaging the Caldari State's forces away from their
    military installations and those who continued to target the FDU's military objectives
    were simply unable to break the State Protectorate's hold.   \n  \nThis year has
    seen the Federal Defence Union once again contesting Caldari State-held systems.
    Alsavoinon was returned to Gallente Federation sovereignty on the 07.02.112 but
    31 other Gallente systems remain under Caldari State control.   \n  \nThe State
    Protectorate are far from allowing the FDU to proceed unopposed. Efforts have
    already begun to retake Alamel, which currently stands contested and on the 08.02.112,
    they captured the Placid system of Hevrice for the second time, after it had been
    resecured by the FDU on the second of this year. Currently no systems originally
    held by the Caldari State rest in Gallente hands.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Alamel
