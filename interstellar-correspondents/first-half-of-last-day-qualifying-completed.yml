    Teams continue to vary their fleet compositions looking for the ideal setup. A
    surprising number of teams have been using Sansha Phantasm cruisers and Nightmare
    battleships in their fleets, with some rather poor results as demonstrated in
    the ATLAS ALLIANCE vs Molotov Coalition match. Using a fleet including 7 Phantasms
    and a Nightmare, ATLAS was not able to make their expensive venture deliver a
    win.


    The heavy utilization of faction cruisers, although popular in the qualifying
    rounds, has not always been the key to a solid win. Statistics will be posted
    after all data has been compiled and analyzed.


    Match results will be posted [here](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=981389)
    as they become available.'
