    Heimatar** \\- A few nights ago, a mixed fleet of Faction Warfare capsuleers,
    mostly in dreadnaughts and battleships, ambushed and destroyed a Pandemic Legion
    titan in Amamake.   \n  \nThe planning itself was done in secrecy \u2013 only
    the planners themselves, Tekitha and Lock Out of Shadows of the Federaion and
    First General of Wolfsbrigade, along with a few trusted aides were informed of
    the plan, with the hope that it would help keep details of the attack from Pandemic
    Legion\u2019s spy network.   \n  \nMost of the members of the 85-man fleet did
    not know the full plan even as they set off for the selected locations and found
    ships waiting for them there. Before long they were rewarded with a sighting of
    a titan.   \n  \nCloaked ships suddenly lit off cynosaural beacons, a titan jump
    bridge was established and the fleet jumped in to attack the Erebus.   \n  \nThat
    part of the plan can be said to have gone off perfectly. Unfortunately a large
    contingent of the Pandemic Legion fleet was only one jump away, waiting for their
    scouts to report a target, and most of the combined Shadows of the Federation
    and Wolfsbrigade fleet was destroyed in short order.   \n  \nWhen asked for comment
    on the destruction of their fleet,Tekitha had the following to say: \"I'd say
    30 insured dreads is less than 30 billion ISK lost, the titan alone was worth
    triple that.\"\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Pandemic Legion Erebus is destroyed](http://eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&kll_id=12761765)
