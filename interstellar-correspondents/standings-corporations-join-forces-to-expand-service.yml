    Eden** \\- Two corporations who share a common goal have decided to form a partnership
    as they help capsuleers raise their standings with megacorporations and factions.
    DNLeviathan and Imiarr Timshae have announced that Standings4U, run under SOZA
    Innovations [SOZAI] and The Standings Correction Agency [TSCA] will be working
    together to bring their services to capsuleers even more efficiently and effectively
    than before.  \n  \nThough their services are open to all capsuleers regardless
    of race or political affiliation, agreement is that most often the industrial
    pilots have the most to gain. DNLeviathan, CEO of Soza Innovations and driving
    force behind the Standings4U service states, \"Most people want it for low tax
    rates and refinery loss, others for research [counterparts].\"  \n  \nImiarr Timshae,
    the decision maker behind TSCA, responds to the question of why they are joining
    forces, \"We met a few weeks ago when our seperate advertising campaigns collided.
    I ended up contacting DNL...\" He continues, \"We'd got to the stage in our conversation
    where we'd just talked about how we each operated and performed our service, and
    found striking parallels, so we eventually decided integration would be almost
    seamless, and we'd halve each other's workload.\"  \n  \nDNLeviathan also states
    that the partnership with TSCA has given them the ability to \"[have] improved
    service provision, [provide] greater...coverage, and with the joint management
    there is a greater response time to all inquiries.\"  \n  \nAlthough standing
    increases are traditionally awarded based on combat actions in a fleet, it is
    not necessary for their clients to be an actual active participant in the combat,
    just a member of the fleet running missions. Mr. Timshae points out, \"The grind
    for 0.00 [standings] to level four mission agent status is a tedious one.\" Because
    of this convenience, the services are not cheap but do free the client up to continue
    their day to day activities while their standings are being raised.  \n  \nSince
    services are provided for corporations found in the space of each of the four
    races, they tend to live a rather nomadic existence. Since capsuleers will see
    them in all areas of New Eden, the easiest way to get in contact with Soza Innovations
    and The Standing Correction Agency is via their communications channel in your
    Neocom, Standings4U/TSCA.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Information about the service](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1435513)\n\n*
