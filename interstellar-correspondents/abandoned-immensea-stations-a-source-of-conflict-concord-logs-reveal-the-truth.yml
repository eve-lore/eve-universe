- body: "One month ago, DED - the enforcement arm of CONCORD - activated a hidden
    spy module in the previously abandoned stations, to monitor their use for the
    good of the empires. One month ago, the surveillance systems began their collection
    of usage data - including any claims of ownership and conquest that might come
    to pass.   \n  \nToday this information was revealed to a stunned crowd of CONCORD
    officials and reporters. It would seem that not only had various corporations
    claimed the stations, but some of them had also been fiercely fought over and
    some of the stations had exchanged hands many times. Still others had been taken
    by a corporation and simply held, without anyone refuting their claim. Like stated
    in CONCORD's initial press release, the stations lie outside CONCORD jurisdiction,
    and were thus free for anyone to grab - if they had the resources. What follows
    is a little data collected by DED's spy modules.   \n  \n\n\n### Most contended
    station:\n\n**Located in V2-VC2, in the Catch region.** Interestingly named _\"MoSDaL's
    pimping central\"_ by one of its owners. The station exchanged hands 118 times
    in the last month, so that name may have been changed as you read this. Currently
    believed to be held by **The Collective**.   \n  \n\n\n### Second most contended
    station:\n\n**Located in BKG-Q2, in the Branch region**. Named _\"PA DOLLHOUSE\"_
    by one of its owners. Exchanged hands 116 times during the last month, and believed
    to be currently held by **Cataclysm Enterprises**.   \n  \n\n\n### Third most
    contended station:\n\n**Located in G8AD-C, in the Cloud Ring region**. Named _\"Compare
    our piles\"_ by one of its owners. Exchanged hands 96 times during the last month,
    and believed to be currently held by **SteelVipers**.   \n  \nOf course, some
    stations weren't fought as hard over. Or were they simply being held by a superior
    force? This reporter doesn't know.   \n  \n\n\n### Longest in possession of one
    corporation:\n\n**C-J6MT IV - Moon 1 - Cloning Outpost** , in Insmother. Held
    by **Northern Guerilla Reaver Unit**.   \n  \n\n\n### Second longest in possession
    of one corporation:\n\n**ZLZ-1Z IV - Moon 3 - Cloning Outpost** , in the Vale
    of the Silent. Held by **Forsaken Empire**.   \n  \n\n\n### Third longest in possession
    of one corporation:\n\n**MO-GZ5 VIII - Moon 2 - Manufacturing Outpost** , in Delve.
    Held by **Free Imperial Vikings**.   \n  \n  \nEven that doesn't tell the whole
    story. Some of the stations were located in systems that were already hotspots.
    Or perhaps they didn't offer any useful services, in which case they were mostly
    left alone. However, it is interesting to see what corporations most often took
    over a station...   \n  \nIn the first place is **Evolution** , the lethal vagabonds,
    having taken a station an amazing 136 times, and holding one at the time this
    is written (\"a station\" in D7-ZAC).   \n  \nIn the second place is **The Collective**
    , veterans of lawless space, who have taken stations 66 times, and currently holding
    two (V2-VC2, like mentioned above and one in 5-N2EY).   \n  \nIn third place is
    **Omega Corp** , with 50 stations taken, but none held at the moment.   \n  \nOther
    big names follow closely. **Tyrell Corp** with 46 times, **m0o** with 42 times,
    **Dragon Clan** and **Forsaken Empire** tied with 32 times and **Shadow Company**
    with 26.   \n  \nCONCORD officials allegedly debated briefly on the wisdom of
    making this data public, but are quoted saying _\"Ah, what's the worst that could
    happen?\"_"
