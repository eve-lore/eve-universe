- body: "After two years of lotteries on a bi-weekly basis, BIG has decided to celebrate
    their 53rd round with a special lottery in honour of their second year anniversary.
    Regular BIG lotteries only feature one winner, claiming the first prize of 250,000,000
    isk. This time however to reflect the special occasion BIG has doubled the first
    prize and added other prizes, including a variety of Tech II items.   \n  \nWe
    at the Interstellar Correspondents department have managed to get in contact with
    BIG\u2019s CEO, TornSoul for a few questions regarding this rounds lottery.   \n
    \ \nMr. TornSoul, what is special about your 2 year anniversary lottery?   \n
    \ \n\"Well, the one very special thing about it is that it is in fact a 2 year
    anniversary. Those are rare. But I know what you are aiming at of course. What
    makes this round special - the 53rd round by the way - Is the huge amount of prizes
    we have got lined up to mark the occasion. Usually the BIG Lottery sports just
    a single cash prize, \"Winner takes it all\" style.\"   \n  \nWhat are the chances
    of actually winning something?   \n  \n\"Well, to answer that \u2013 I would need
    to know how many tickets are sold - which I don\u2019t. But taking the last rounds
    as basis, i.e. the amount of tickets sold the last rounds. Then the chance is
    around 10-15% to win *something*.\"   \n  \nHow many people usually participate
    in BIG\u2019s lotteries and how many tickets are sold on average?   \n  \n\"The
    last many rounds it has been between 100-120 each round and around 200-250 thousand
    tickets sold, corresponding to 200M-250M ISK.\"   \n  \nYou have held special
    lotteries in the past, what are your expectations in participations for this round
    of your lottery?   \n  \n\"Well... it is very hard to speculate about... I would
    guess around 3 times as many participants as usual. Some of the prizes offered
    are rather sought after - and most importantly - hard to get by usually. 'Rare'
    Tech2 ships especially.\"   \n  \nConcluding the interview Ms. TornSoul, added
    the following comment.   \n  \nAt an anniversary you always tend to 'look back'
    a bit. I am very happy and surprised that I'm able to look that far back - 2 years...
    I would like to use the chance to thank all those who over the years - Never thought
    I would be able to say that about the BIG Lottery - have taken part. The BIG Lottery
    is only there because people actually think it is fun to take part So, thanks
    to all those who have taken part over the years - and in the end made the BIG
    Lottery the record running success it is.   \n  \nThe ticket price for this special
    round is 1,000 ISK with a maximum of 5000 tickets per character and the winners
    will be drawn on May 23rd at 1800 Eve time. For further details of how to participate,
