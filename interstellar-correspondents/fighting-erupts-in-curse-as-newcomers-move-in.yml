    Curse** - Tensions have risen sharply in Curse after Darkside. moved into Hale
    constellation. Local residents Kahora Catori spoke out on GalNet, claiming that
    Darkside. are invading their home to gain access to the Serpentis and Angel Cartel
    agents that occupy the area.  \n  \nThe Hale constellation already sees frequent
    and vicious engagements between allies, Kahora Catori, Panda Supremacy and Blade.
    and Gentlemen's Club and Triumvirate, among others.  \n  \nAtropos Kahn of Kahora
    Catori gave his alliance's view on the new conflicts engendered by Darkside's
    arrival. \"Hopefully, we can find some sort of political solution, but in the
    meantime we are counting on our [capsuleers] to knuckle down.\"  \n  \nDarkside's
    spokesperson, Miracle, seemed confident that they could keep a foothold in Hale.
    \"Although not all of our forces have moved, there [are] enough of us to dominate
    in Hale.\"  \n  \nThe fighting has been fierce with some alliances visiting the
    system just to seek combat; Gentlemen's Club is one such alliance. Their spokesman,
    Camaris said \"I don't think Darkside. will last long. They are a strong force
    but not strong enough to run their own alliance and fight a force that has been
    living there for so long.\"  \n  \nThe arrival of Darkside. has certainly stirred
    a pot that was already boiling. Fighting has become intense in the Hale area and
    while Darkside. attempt to unsettle alliances like Kahora Catori, there are others,
    like Gentlemen's Club, who drop into the fracas periodically and engage all-comers.
    The area currently remains hotly contested with thousands of ships already destroyed
    in the ongoing battles.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[CAOD Statement from Kahora
