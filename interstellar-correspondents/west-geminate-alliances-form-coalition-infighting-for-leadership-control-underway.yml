    \\- A coalition of alliances has been formed with the goal of capturing systems
    in Geminate after Widly Inappropriate. [WI.] [dropped sovereignty in the area](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?article=3617).
    Currently, leadership by TERMINATION [-74-] is being challenged by In Tea We Trust
    [TLEAF].  \n  \nPhunkadin of TLEAF reports \"On the very first day, the Coalition
    joined together and formed up an impressive fleet of nearly 200 in under 3 hours.
    There were carriers, dreadnoughts and even an Aeon ready to do battle, accompanied
    by hundreds of support ships.  \n  \n\"We first attacked WI. jump bridges and
    cyno arrays in AD-5B8 and all was going smoothly until we were hot dropped by
    a WI. fleet of similar strength. Fights ensued and unfortunately WI. held the
    field, but less than a week later a friendly structure which had been put into
    reinforced [was engaged by] WI. [and] [huge ATLAS fleet was jumped in by a coalition
    [friend] and battle ensued.](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?article=3625)\"
    \ \n  \nShortly after, Apollo428 introduced himself as a spokesman for the newly
    founded \"Anathema Coalition,\" a coalition made up of alliances operating in
    West Geminate. \"WI. is a part of the Northern Coalition and no we are not afraid
    of them. We will not stop the attacks on WI. until they have been fully removed
    from Geminate.\"  \n  \nAll did not go well inside Anathema Coalition, however
    and TLEAF has since declared war on TERMINATION and Eternus Imperium Alliance
    [EIA]. \"After multiple acts of disrespect... and their violation of TLEAF's anti-piracy
    policy in their home system of Eurgrana, TERMINATION was caught attempting to
    sneak an IHUB into a nullsec system after TERMINATION Alliance had established
    a policy of distributing control of Geminate and the anchoring of IHUB until after
    the campaign is completed.\"  \n  \nThis incident was reported by an anonymous
    source as having occurred due to a TERMINATION member not being present at the
    policy setting discussion and when jumping into Eurgrana was \"met by a blue force
    that were intent on attacking him... and told... that if he was to [return to
    Eurgrana] it would be [considered] a declaration of war.\"  \n  \nBlunter, the
    founding member of TLEAF, reports \"We found that quite possibly the Coalition
    leadership... were trying to manipulate a good faith agreement to work together\"
    to remove Wildly Inappropriate. as owners of Geminate. He went on to claim that
    there are a number of Coalition members who \"have overstepped their boundaries\"
    and that TLEAF's \"Terminated\" campaign against EIA and -74- would continue until
    \"a mutual level of respect is gained on all sides. [We] are still supporting
    the overall goals of the Coalition.\"  \n  \nCurrent major conflict areas with
    WI. \"are on the border systems of Geminate, some of the Coalition are based in
    nullsec stations.\" Apollo428 further reports that \"WI. has no idea what we are
    capable of.\"  \n  \nInternally, TLEAF reports \"We are resolved in firmly holding
    our ground in Eurgrana whilst this fight for honour and respect is resolved. The
    [infrastructure upgrades are] a fantastic opportunity for smaller, less-known
    Alliances... to make identifiable and clear moves into... sovereignty whilst maintaining
    our corporation and alliance culture and not [being forced to merge] with bigger
    entities.\"\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this article? Do you
