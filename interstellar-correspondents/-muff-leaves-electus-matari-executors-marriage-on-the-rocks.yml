- body: "Pator - The Republic capsuleer community was abuzz the past week with the
    news on 24 February that the Minmatar United Freedom Front, a founding member
    of Electus Matari, would be leaving the alliance by the end of the week. According
    to -MUFF CEO Meklon, the corporation came to the conclusion that it was \u201Cfinally
    time...to move forward to new goals which, unfortunately, cannot be reached within
    the current political and operational structure used by Electus Matari.\u201D
    However, rumors persist that marital problems between Meklon and his wife and
    successor as Electus Matari executor, Evanda Char, may have had something to do
    with the split as well. \n\nThough the first public notice of the Freedom Front's
    decision to leave Electus Matari and form their own alliance was only this week,
    a number of people we talked to in the Electus Matari leadership said that the
    move was not particularly surprising in light of problems MUFF had been suffering
    since Meklon was forced to take a leave of absence last July. Elsebeth Rhiannon,
    Electus Matari spokeswoman, said that -MUFF \u201Clost a lot of influence and
    capacity during his absence,\u201D and Gradient CEO Rocius said \u201Ctheir activity
    has been sporadic, and greatly felt the loss of Meklon during his time in the
    med labs.\u201D \n\nCompounding these problems, the leadership of the Freedom
    Front has been butting heads with the other Electus Matari leaders, pushing for
    the alliance to take a more aggressive stance against the Amarr. These internal
    political pressures seemed to take their toll on the Freedom Front's relationship
    with the established leadership, consisting of Re-Awakened Technologies and Gradient.
    When Meklon returned to active duty, the troubles seemed to come to a head. \n\nBehind
    the scenes, however, it appears that the personal relationship between Meklon
    and Evanda Char was also disintegrating. The burden of leadership, the added pressure
    of a conflict between Electus Matari and both Caldari and Amarr paramilitaries,
    and Meklon's medical problems appears to have weighed heavily on Commander Char's
    shoulders. As a result, she sought solace in the arms of another. While requests
    for comment from Char or her press secretary on the matter were denied, Rocius
    told us that rumors of an affair between him and the alliance executor were true.
    When Meklon returned to duty and found out about the affair, there was a physical
    confrontation between him and Rocius, though both men tried to downplay the incident
    and said that their relationship has remained professional. \n\nIt's clear that
    this has had an effect on the marriage of Meklon and Char, however. Just six weeks
    ago, shortly after Meklon returned to duty, the two of them appeared to be quite
    in love when interviewed for another news article, but the two are now separated
    and a divorce seems likely, though Meklon expressed regret at the situation. \u201CEvery
    time I open the file, I cannot bring myself to sign the dotted line,\u201D he
    said with regard to the couple's divorce papers. \u201CEvanda, if anything, was
    the reason I choose to stay with the Electus for this long after my return.\u201D
    \n\nElsebeth Rhiannon, not only Char's press secretary but a close personal friend
    and confidante, told us that she believed the marriage was suffering long before
    Meklon's convalescence and the affair, however. \u201CI think they rushed it,\u201D
    she told us. Citing the stresses both had in their roles as corporate leaders
    and already confrontational nature of the Freedom Front compared to the rest of
    Electus Matari, Rhiannon told us that she thought the marriage was an uphill battle
    from the start. \u201CI did wish that they'd be happy,\u201D she said. \u201CI
    merely estimated the odds not in their favor.\u201D Admiral Rodj Blake, leader
    of the Amarr paramilitary PIE Inc, commented that the marriage was \u201Cclearly
    a mockery of that fine institution to begin with\u201D when contacted by IC. \n\nWhatever
    the reason, it appears that the relationships between both -MUFF and Electus Matari
    and Meklon and Evanda Char are coming to an end. We asked Meklon what his plans
    were for his new alliance, the 11th Hour, which was established with CONCORD on
    28 February. \u201CI felt that we could do more for the people who are currently
    held in bonds than what we were currently doing,\u201D he said, explaining that
    he wants his new alliance to take a more aggressive role against the Amarr Empire,
    using the forces mustered by the Minmatar loyalist capsuleer community against
    targets in Amarr space. \n\nWhen asked if this meant he was moving towards favoring
    the positions of the Ushra'Khan, he tried to downplay any connection. \"My plans,
    if they succeed, are more of tact than reliance on brute force,\" he said, though
    he made sure to recognize the contributions of the \"brave pilots of the 'Khan\"
    to the Minmatar cause. He added that it was likely that that his forces would
    end up working closely with Ushra'Khan pilots against the fortified positions
    of the Curatores Veritatis Alliance in the Providence region. As far as specific
    plans for the 11th Hour, Meklon declined to give any insight into what those might
    be. \n\nThe growing diversification of the Minmatar loyalist capsuleer bloc is
    something that many in the defense establishment of not only the Republic, but
    the other three major nations, will be watching closely as international tensions
    increase throughout the cluster. \n\nSpeaking on the issue, Getonsur Irkold, a
    professor of political science and foreign policy at Republic University, told
    us that \u201Cany conflict between the four major nations of the cluster is likely
    to be influenced by the involvement of the pod pilot community.\" He added that
    \"the fractious nature of the Minmatar loyalists must obviously be of some concern
    to the Republic's military and intelligence agencies.\"\n\n\"They have likely
    been concerned somewhat about the strength and cohesion the Amarr paramilitaries
    over the last few years. Should the Republic come under attack, it remains to
    be seen how well the various Minmatar loyalist forces will be able to work together.\u201D\n\nIt
    remains to be seen if MUFF and the 11th Hour will represent an attempt to bridge
    those differences, or contribute to the divisiveness that has sometimes plagued
    the Minmatar capsuleer community."
