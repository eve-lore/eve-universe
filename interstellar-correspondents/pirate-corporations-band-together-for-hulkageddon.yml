    Laison** , A group of pirate corporations and several capsuleers within empire
    corporations declared a one day pogrom against empire-based miners; the operation
    was designated \"Hulkageddon\" and was spread out over multiple regions and systems
    with fleet commanders coordinating the times of attack.  \n  \nMembers of approximately
    eighteen corporations took part, including The Python Cartel. [GROP3], I.M.M.
    [IMM], The Bastards [BSTRD], and Space Jerks [UJERK] alongside members of the
    empire corporations The Scope [TS], Garoun Investment Bank [GIB] and Sebiestor
    Tribe [S]; all willing participants in this self described \"terrorist act\".
    According to several reports, the organizer of this attack was Helicity Boson
    of The Python Cartel.   \n  \nWhile the exact motivations behind this act are
    unknown, Hulkageddon involved a concerted effort to hunt down and destroy empire
    based miners, despite the certainty of CONCORD intervention. A GalNet notice posted
    by the offenders claims that the group engaged and destroyed \"66 Exhumers, 22
    mining barges and 27 pods\", with no losses incurred by return fire from their
    victims.  \n  \nAttacking ship types, as described by Kobrakilla [UJERK], were
    \"primarily Catalysts and several battleships fitted with smart bombs.\" In addition
    to security rating penalties, most of the capsuleers involved lost their ships
    to the CONCORD response fleets.  \n  \nKobrakilla describes \"stunned silence\"
    as the only response of their victims to these attacks, followed by other potential
    targets \"docking up en masse.\" He estimates the combined ship loss for Hulkageddon
    participants to be approximately \"300 disposable ships, paid for by insurance
    and loot\", adding that so many Catalysts were lost to CONCORD that at one point
    \"we bought Jita out of Catalysts.\"  \n  \nThis attack serves to underscore the
    continuing need for all capsuleers to be vigilant of their surroundings and exercise
    due caution regardless of the security status of the system that they are in.
    Kobrakilla's closing remark serves to further reinforce the point, he states that
    \"this\u2026is not\u2026the end.\"  \n  \nNone of the victims contacted could
    be reached for comment.\n\n#### Battle Report\n\n[Hulkageddon Kills](http://hulkageddon.griefwatch.net/index.php?p=kills)\n\n*
