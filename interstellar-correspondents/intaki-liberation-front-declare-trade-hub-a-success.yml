    [ILF] have succeeded in raising what they believe to be billions of ISK in the
    system.   \n  \n[Nine months on from the completion of an upgrade to their Prosperity
    station](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=3455&tid=7), the ILF have
    attempted to create a \"one-stop shop\" for small and medium ships in the Placid
    region, with the hope of also being able to offer every type of hull, rig and
    item a capsuleer may wish for.   \n  \nApollonius Verus, spokesperson for ILF
    listed their recent sales in the Intaki 5-5 trade hub and what they have on offer.
    \"[Between] June 7th [and] July 6th, we sold 168 ship hulls. This included 22
    battlecruisers, 30 cruisers, 14 destroyers, 72 frigates, 22 shuttles, 7 mining
    barges, and 1 industrial. We currently have 24 battlecruisers, 97 cruisers, 49
    destroyers, 360 frigates, 110 shuttles, 11 mining barges, and 18 industrials for
    sale on the Intaki market. All ships were produced locally at our Prosperity Station
    shipyards.\"   \n  \nApollonius said \"Many of the profits are re-invested back
    into our factories and labs for ongoing research and manufacturing that keeps
    the Intaki trade hub supplied with goods. Another portion of the profits goes
    toward our anti-pirate... activities. Two examples of this are the ILF's Ship
    Replacement Program and our Anti-Pirate Bounty Program.\"   \n  \nThese ILF programmes
    replacing every hull up to tech 1 battlecruisers lost by an ILF member in action
    against pirates and a 10 million ISK bounty for every pirate capsuleer destroyed
    within four jumps of Intaki.   \n  \nThe ILF believe that they already offer the
    highest level of trade activity in low-sec Placid and Apollonius described his
    organization's future plans in the area. \"I next envision us competing even more
    aggressively with Stacmon V-9 and Orvolle I, the high-sec Placid trade hubs. We
    already beat the prices of one or the other hub on many ships and items. We also
    plan to expand into T2 ship production and sales. Who really knows how far we
    can take it?\"\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this article? Do
