    GEMINATE** \\- Wildly Inappropriate [WI] has confirmed a full scale invasion of
    Geminate, initiated on 07.4.111, is underway. The news follows weeks of increased
    [WI] activity and invasion rumors in the Geminate region.  \n  \nReports from
    the region indicate that [WI] successfully uprooted Idle Empire [IDLE] from the
    area within forty-eight hours and are currently targeting Ethereal Dawn's [ED]
    control towers in the 8K-CHA constellation as well as United Freeman Alliance
    [UFA] fleets. Currently [ED]'s sovereignty has dropped in three of 8K-CHA's seven
    systems.  \n  \n\"As a growing alliance our goal is to expand to a more reasonable
    sized area of operation than our current holdings in Branch,\" stated [WI] diplomat
    Tomcat. \"...being our first offensive operation as an alliance, this also creates
    a public identity for [WI] and what we can be capable of. This also allows us
    a more strategic beach-head for longer term pvp operations.\"  \n  \nThe attack
    on [ED] space in Geminate coincides with Majesta Empire's (also a Northern Coalition
    alliance) assault on [ED] control towers in the LS-JEP system in Vale of the Silent.
    Both attacks have garnered little resistance from [ED] according to [WI]. \"The
    space is not much value to us at all,\" emphasized [ED] CEO Ralian Gelian. \"LS-JEP
    is pretty useless space aside from the cosmos constellation next door.\"  \n  \nAccording
    to Gelian there has been little concern for the area given that \"we have much
    bigger targets to focus on.\" Ethereal Dawn and sister alliance Intrepid Crossing
    [IRC] are currently engaged in a fierce conflict with Red Alliance [RA] and several
    smaller factions in both Etherium Reach and Insmother. Gelian believes the Northern
    Coalition attacks are intended to \"pull us off our current campaign vs [RA],
    which really hasn't slowed us down much at all.\"  \n  \nIt is unknown as to where
    the [WI] invasion armada will turn once the mostly uncontested invasion of 8K-CHA
    concludes.  \n  \nAnalysts have already recognized that the fall of 8K-CHA allows
    for direct, conventional access to NK-AOZ - the larger of [UFA]'s two constellations.
    While [WI] is keeping all information concerning the potential for an invasion
    of NK-AOZ classified, the possibility certainly exists given the moderate amount
    of fighting taking place between [WI] and [UFA]. Last week's battles leaned in
    [WI]'s favor with the destruction of three [UFA] carriers.  \n  \nAt this moment
    Tomcat believes the majority of [UFA]'s fleet has been \"pinned down\" in the
    K25-XD system of NK-AOZ - their sole station system in Geminate.  \n  \n\"The
    thought that first comes to mind is 'as planned',\" stated Tomcat when asked to
    speculate on the invasion's outcome. \"Everything thus far has been executed perfectly
    ...everything is right on schedule.\"  \n  \n[UFA] is taking a wait-and-see approach
    to the conflict and indicated they were aware of the impending invasion well in
    advance. According to Gendril, a [UFA] CEO, no [UFA] towers have been aggressed
    and any losses sustained up to this point have been insignificant. However, he
    noted that [WI]'s numerical advantage has been a factor.  \n  \nAttempts to contact
    [IDLE] for a statement were unsuccesful.\n\n### **GalNet References**\n\n[Geminate/Vale
