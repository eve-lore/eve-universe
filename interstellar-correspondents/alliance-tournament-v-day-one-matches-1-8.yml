    and drones shred competition vessels ruthlessly in an opening round filled with
    carnage. With a diverse mix of tactics and some surprising results already, the
    tournament has already provided some great viewing. Here are the initial results
    and reviews of the first eight matches. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 1: Blood Blind Vs
    The Kadeshi**\n\nThe first match of the tournament opens with a convincing win
    from The Kadeshi against Blood Blind.\n\n**Blood Blind:** 3 Ruptures | 6 Thorax
    | A last Thorax pilot had ship problems and dropped from the fight before the
    beginning of the match.  \n**The Kadeshi:** 4 Vagabonds | Fleet Issue Stabber
    | 2 Atrons | 2 Kitsune\n\nIn a move reminiscent of the infamous Star Fraction
    Vs Band of Brothers match, the fight opened with a swarm of ECM drones launched
    from the Blood Blind Thoraxes. With no damage being taken by The Kadeshi vessels,
    and a Rupture quickly taken into armor, it looked grim from the beginning for
    Blood Blind. As Vagabonds circled at a 20km orbit, leaving their own mass of combat
    drones to apply a spread of damage, they soon began to take down their opponents.
    The only loss was a Kitsune that was caught turning into the fire. Despite several
    drop outs from their own pilots, costing them at least one Vagabond, Kadeshi slowly
    whittled their opponents down to walk away with a win. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 2:
    The Star Fraction Vs Molotov Coalition.**\n\nThe first totalhelldeath of the tournament
    came in a decidedly one way fight, with SF going down rapidly against Molotov
    Coalition.\n\n**The Star Fraction:** 1 Dominix | 2 Ishtar | 2 Rooks  \n**Molotov
    Coalition:** 3 Megathron | Maulus | 6 Griffins\n\nWith only two Rooks to jam a
    large amount of pilots and nothing to stop the advance of the triple-Megathrons
    charging into the fray, SF quickly saw the loss of their first Rook, which dropped
    rapidly under the savage firepower. The second Rook soon followed, then the Dominix
    and Ishtars soon after. Molotov\u2019s well-designed team proved easily superior,
    their decision to spread out both their damage and electronic warfare across greater
    numbers giving them a big win against one of this year\u2019s more anticipated
    contestants. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 3: Hydra Alliance Vs Synchr0nicity**\n\nThe
    third match of the tournament, and a quick and bloody match, with Hydra snatching
    a decisive victory from Synchronicity.\n\n**Hydra Alliance:** 5 Ishtars | 5 Griffins
    \  \n**Synchr0nicity:** Raven | 2 Myrmidons | Hurricane | 2 Blackbirds\n\nThe
    two Blackbirds from Synchronicity were primaried from the beginning by the Hydra
    team and were mauled under a withering swarm of drones. Synchronicity returned
    fire, trying to eliminate the Griffon ECM support of Hydra, but by the time they
    had eliminated them, they had lost their Hurricane, leaving them with only a Raven
    and a pair of Myrmidons. This handful of heavy ships could not hold out against
    the drone swarm and remote repair logistics strength of the five Hydra Ishtars,
    giving Hydra a strong win to start off the tourney. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 4: SMASH
    Alliance Vs Green Alliance**\n\nAnother decisive win this time, with Green Alliance
    taking apart SMASH and gaining the second totalhelldeath win of the tournament.\n\n**SMASH
    Alliance:** Harbinger | Drake | Basilisk | Thorax | Manticore | Crusader | 2 Deimos
    \ \n**Green Alliance:** Hurricane: 4 Ishtars | 2 Amarr Navy Slicers | 2 Punishers\n\nPotential
    warp-in troubles set the scene against SMASH early on with their frigates positioned
    poorly. Despite this, they looked solid initially, taking an enemy Hurricane into
    half armor quickly. Soon after however, they saw their own Basilisk being torn
    to pieces, and things began to turn against them fast. With the Hurricane rapidly
    repaired back to full armor, it was then only a matter of time. A mix of ECM and
    combat drones from SMASH perhaps spread their capabilities too thinly, and Green
    Alliance was able to exploit this for a convincing win. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 5:
    Pandemic Legion Vs Brutally Clever Empire**\n\nAn interesting clash between two
    renowned alliances: Bruce loses to Pandemic Legion but did so impressively, managing
    to score points that could later prove vital.\n\n**Pandemic Legion:** 3 Abaddon
    | Dardevil | 5 Vigil  \n**Brutally Clever Empire:** Kronos | Rook | 4 Taranis
    | Crow\n\nWithin the first few seconds of the fight, the Rook \u2013 unable to
    jam all three Abaddons - was torn apart by their impressive combined laser fire,
    tilting the advantage heavily in Pandemic\u2019s favour. The Kronos followed not
    long after, leaving only their interceptors for the majority of the fight.\n\nIt
    was not yet entirely over however, and to their credit Bruce fought on, going
    after the Pandemic support and eventually taking them all down. Against 3 Abaddons
    that were smartbombing and using remote-logistics however, they were unable to
    either close range, use drones, or provide enough damage to come out with an late-game
    upset win. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 6: Mercenary Coalition Vs Cry Havoc.**\n\nCry
    Havoc. comes away with a solid victory against MC, proving the reliability of
    their team formation and displaying an impressive ability to use it to full extent.\n\n**Mercenary
    Coalition:** Vargur | 2 Golems | Griffin  \n**Cry Havoc.:** Raven | 2 Ishtars
    | Guardian | Rook\n\nThe first ranged fight of the tournament, spectators saw
    some impressive damage coming from the MC heavy ships. Despite the onslaught,
    the aptly-named Guardian kept the Rook intact just long enough to disrupt the
    MC team and draw their fire, as they turned their own guns on MC\u2019s Griffin.
    With the Rook dropping deeper into hull as each potent alpha-strike rained down,
    Cry Havoc was in a race against time to eliminate the MC ships before losing their
    ECM support. However, under some also-impressive firepower by the Cry Havoc Ishtars
    and Raven, the Vargur fell rapidly, and with the Rook still clinging to life,
    the two Golems inevitably followed. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 7: Blade. Vs Cosa Nostra.**\n\nAnother
    one-sided victory this match, with Blade failing to overcome a solid team formation
    put forward by Cosa Nostra, who come away with the third totalhelldeath of the
    day.\n\n**Cosa Nostra.:** Harbinger | Hurricane | Curse | 2 Guardian  \n**Blade.:**
    8 Thoraxes | 2 Caracal\n\nUnable to break the locks of one Guardian as they focused
    on the other, it was over before it began for Blade. Thoraxes dropped quickly
    against the combined firepower of the Harbinger, Hurricane and drones of the Curse,
    with its energy neutralization no doubt adding to their rapid demise. A quick
    and simple affair for Cosa Nostra. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 8: Phalanx Alliance Vs
    The Crimson Federation**\n\nThe fourth totalhelldeath of the day and tournament,
    Phalanx walked away with a decisive victory against Crimson Federation. \n\n**The
    Crimson Federation:** 3 Rooks | 3 Thorax | Arbitrator | Griffin  \n**Phalanx Alliance:**
    3 Hyperion | Drake | Vigil\n\nAn aggressive and brutal fight this time around,
    with Crimson Federation fielding a unique and ultimately unsuccessful team formation.
    Within the opening seconds all four cruisers had been made primary by different
    Hyperions, ignoring the Rooks and instantly taking their targets deep into armor.
    Unfortunately for Crimson Federation, their Rooks' heavy ECM only succeeded in
    delaying the inevitable victory by Phalanx Alliance.\n\nMore coverage to come
    as the next eight fights wrap up. \n\n* * *\n\n_Eve-TV Coverage: Day One_  \n[View](http://www.eve-online.com/evetv/tunein.asp)"
