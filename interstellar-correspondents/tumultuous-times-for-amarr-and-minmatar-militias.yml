    - The corporation Dark-Rising parted ways with the Minmatar Militia last week
    just two days after Amarr Militia corporation Gunship Diplomacy announced it was
    leaving the Empire's service for frontier space.  \n  \nCompounding the Minmatar
    loss, the former Minor Threat [KARMA] corporation Digital Fury recently pledged
    allegiance to the Empire while Minmatar loyalist corporation Reikoku disappeared
    from the factional warfare front with little fanfare earlier this week.   \n  \n\"With
    both militias, corporations come and go\u2026 I think that the Crusade's big advantage
    in the conflict is that we also have a core of pilots who are committed to indefinite
    service to the Empire and are in it for the long haul, whilst the Shakorites lack
    a similar group,\" said Rodj Blake of the Amarrian loyalists PIE Inc. \"As such,
    we will over time grind them down despite having fewer pilots.\"  \n  \nAngry
    Fist of Tribal Core noted that the loss of Dark-Rising was \"quite a blow\" to
    the Republic.  \n  \n\"They were a great bunch of pilots, fun to work with and
    willing to work with others which can be rare of large corps. It's just a shame
    the militia didn't offer them enough to sustain their interest,\" he explained.
    \  \n  \nWhen asked if the recent swing in numbers, bringing the Empire closer
    to numerical parity, was reason to worry in regards to the battle for system occupancy,
    Angry Fist explained that \"The stalemate in system occupancy is a complicated
    issue that isn't just down to the numbers on each side. If there are actually
    enough corporations and fleet commanders on each side interested in system occupancy
    then the rest of the militia will follow and get involved. Otherwise the stalemate
    will continue.\"  \n  \nDark-Rising did not respond to an interview request.\n\n###
    Recent Events Recap\n\nThe last month and a half of conflict has seen greatly
    increased activity levels in the occupancy battle between the Amarrian and Minmatar
    militias. The capture of Siseide by the Empire followed by the brief capture of
    Halmah by Republic forces marked the first successful occupancy campaign by either
    militia since the battle for Ezzara which concluded with the Amarrian recapture
    in April.  \n  \nIn addition to the occupancy changes, a clash between Minmatar
    and combined Amarr-Caldari elements came to an odd and costly conclusion in early
    July. The incident drew universal attention when a Northern Coalition capital
    fleet interceded for reasons unknown scattering all involved militias. A Dark-Rising
    station and an Amarrian dreadnought were destroyed by the NC during the battle.
    \ \n  \nSpeculation immediately arose that the attack was an opportunity for the
    NC to strike a former KenZoku corporation within the Minmatar Militia. However,
    the NC refused to comment on this conjecture.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Dark-Rising
