    large control tower was destroyed by Red.Overlord forces in BDV3-T. Subsequent
    engagements over the next four hours involved a Northern Coalition capital fleet
    cynoing into the system to engage Southern Coalition control tower gunners at
    another moon. A Southern Coalition fleet then engaged the Northern Coalition capital
    forces, culminating with two titans entering the fray and discharging doomsday
    devices on the sieging Northern Coalition capitals.  \n  \nThe engagements ended
    with Southern Coalition forces reinforcing opposing structures. Northern Coalition
    suffered some support losses, but was able to pull back, saving its capital fleet
    with the exception of a single dreadnaught loss.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Scrapheap
