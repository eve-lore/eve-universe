    and a return to Not Red Don't Shoot (NRDS) rules of engagement.   \n  \nSince
    the end of the conflict between Against All Authorities and CVA, the region is
    far from attracting the levels of unaffiliated pilots and their accompanying trade
    that it did previously. While CVA's enforcement of NRDS in the region was done
    out of a wish to extend Imperial law with the intent of eventually handing the
    region over to the Amarr Empire, the new residents of Providence rule their space
    in their names and in pursuit of their own ideologies, which vary from one alliance
    to the next.   \n  \n[![9UY4-H's Station](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3998/9uy4-h-stationthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3998/9uy4-h-station.png)According
    to Forlorn Wongraven of Ushra'Khan, a few neutral corporations and alliances are
    still present in the region. He explained that while an NRDS ROE allows neutral
    capsuleers to kill Sansha ships and mine without hostility from Ushra'Khan pilots,
    those rules apply _only_ to Ushra'Khan pilots.   \n  \nMany other spaceholders
    in the region are still strictly NBSI and Ushra'Khan have stated that they will
    not seek to enforce their own ROE upon their neighbours nor act as \"space police\"
    on wanderers' behalves.   \n  \nAccording to some of Providence's new inhabitants,
    conflict, albeit on a smaller scale than the past war, is still rife in Providence.
    \"We have seen neutrals pass here many times. They do not seek ISK here however,
    all neutrals that pass are here to fight,\" said Michal Kaczev of Sodalitas XX
    alliance.   \n  \nMichal Kaczev explained that current NRDS rules of engagement
    are not dictated but rather suggested by Ushra'Khan to their allies. He emphasised
    that Sodalitas XX follows NBSI policies and any neutral found by its pilots is
    promptly dispatched.\n\n### Providence Diplomatic Contacts\n\nWith sovereignty
    costs greatly increased since the region was first conquered by Amarrian holders,
    the space in Providence is divided between 20 different alliances, each with their
    own diplomats and rules of engagement. Travelling far into the region inevitably
    requires pilots to pass through systems held by NBSI-alliances, so communication
    and political nouse is essential for those wishing to operate in the area.  \n
    \ \nSome possible routes for diplomatic contact with spaceholders in the region
    are given below, but please be aware that the availability and workloads of such
    individuals varies. If you are aware of any updates, corrections or omissions
