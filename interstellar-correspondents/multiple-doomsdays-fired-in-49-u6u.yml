    the fiercely-contested system of 49-U6U in the evening of the 20th.**\n\n[![Camera

    battles on the 20th-21st were over five control towers that were contesting GoonSwarm's
    sovereignty on behalf of KenZoku, that were scheduled to emerge from [reinforced
    mode](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.eveonline.com%2Fwiki%2FStarbase_Defense_Management%23Surviving_The_Siege%3A_Reinforced_Mode.21).\n\nThe
    attacking forces - KenZoku, Against ALL Authorities and their allies - had staged
    a heavy buildup over the course of the day, peaking at [300-400 ships in the system](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scrapheap-challenge.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fp%3D787248%23787248),
    with a heavy capital presence. Shortly before KenZoku's first control tower was
    due to become vulnerable, Against ALL Authorities forces suddenly left the system.
    Shadoo of Pandemic Legion (one of the alliances working with GoonSwarm to defend
    the recently-conquered system of 49-U6U) [expressed his reaction at the time](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scrapheap-challenge.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fp%3D787248%23787248):\n\n\"Our
    'tinfoil' meter went red with cap fight bait as -A- suddenly decided to leave
    [49-U6U] system.\"\n\n('Tinfoil' is a metaphor used by capsuleers to denote suspicions
    of tricks, traps and conspiracies. It refers to the 'tinfoil hats' supposedly
    worn by the paranoid to protect themselves from mind-control rays.)\n\n\"We tracked
    them moving towards some formup system, before getting scout reports from [Red
    Alliance and Shadow of xXDEATHXx] that they had gone to 46d to save towers [that
    we think] Death had put in reinforced yesterday.\n\n\"As such, we quickly called
    all hands on deck to attempt to break into 49-U6U and secure system control as
    there were 5 towers coming out of reinforced while Against ALL Authorities was
    on a roadtrip. Our numbers slowly built up, but we still did not have comfortable
    numbers in case this turned into a capital slugfest and thus let one [control
    tower] be repped.\"\n\nWhile the tower was being repaired, at 16:20, BlackHawk69
    (Black Eclipse Corp, KenZoku) unleashed an Aurora Ominae doomsday weapon from
    his Erebus-class titan against a group of GoonSwarm and Pandemic Legion battleships
    and support that were trapped inside a heavy interdictor bubble generated by SFShootme's
    Onyx. The blast [killed 39 hostiles and 4 of his allied force](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.killboard.net%2Fplayer%2FBlackHawk69%2Fkills%2F).\n\nThe
    second tower to emerge from reinforced mode saw heavy fighting. Support ships
    from Pandemic Legion, the Northern Coalition and Goonswarm engaged enemy carriers
    outside the tower's shields, trying to force them back inside where they would
    be unable to use their remote repair modules on either the tower or supporting
    vessels. KenZoku and their allies brought in snipers and trapped the attacking
    support ships in interdiction bubbles. Both sides took losses in the ensuing exchange
    of fire, but KenZoku ships were forced to withdraw from the tower by incoming
    GoonSwarm, Northern Coalition and Pandemic Legion capitals.\n\nUnder fire from
    Dreadnoughts in siege mode, the tower was sustaining hull damage when a C0ven
    battleship fleet warped in and attempted to snip the sieging dreads. The fleet
    was probed down by the defenders and a counter-attack warped in directly atop
    them - at such close range, the sniper ships were heavily disadvantaged by their
    poor turret tracking. A squadron of smartbombing battleships from Tau Ceti Federation
    [wreaked havoc on both sides](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scrapheap-challenge.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fp%3D787248%23787248),
    but successfully drew the fire of the C0ven ships, allowing the Pandemic Legion
    sniper fleet time to work unhindered.\n\nPandemic Legion attempted to unleash
    a double-doomsday from Shadoo and Viper ShizzIe against the main KenZoku fleet,
    but the ships were mostly [able to evacuate before the weapons were fired](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scrapheap-challenge.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fp%3D787248%23787248).
    The bubbled support fleet used the opportunity to escape, however, and re-engaged
    the Stain Wagon sniper fleet. The KenZoku fleet returned to aid them, and while
    both sides took heavy casualties, the greater capital forces from GoonSwarm, Pandemic
    Legion and the Northern Coalition took their toll and a heavy assault cruiser
    fleet from Sons of Tangra arrived to reinforce the sovereignty-holders' forces.\n\nThe
    Interstellar Correspondents attempted to reach members of KenZoku and Against
    ALL Authorities for comments and corroboration, but the only member who could
    be reached was LadyScarlet, who only said \"Bright lights\" as she was in combat
    at the time.\n\nIn the course of the day's fighting, in total one KenZoku tower
    was successfully repaired and 3 destroyed, along with a RED.Overlord tower (RED.Overlord
    are allies of KenZoku in the current conflict).\n\n#### GalNet References\n\n**Interstellar
