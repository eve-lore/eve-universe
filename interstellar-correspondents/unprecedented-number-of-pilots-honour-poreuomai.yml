    Matari praised Poreuomai, stating that \u201CA cursory search will show the character
    of [his] combat record, his debating skill, and reveal his enthusiasm and excitement
    for this community\u201D, while Ugleb of Sarz\u2019na Khumatari described Poreuomai
    by saying \u201CThis is a man who has not turned from the truths in his life,
    this is a man who knows his self.\u201D   \n  \nUgleb was praised by Zoolkhan,
    a member of Mirkur Draug\u2019tyr, who stated \u201CThe speech was just right.
    Ugleb is a master of words \u2014 He finds them while the rest of us still seek
    them\u201D. Zoolkhan added that though the number of pilots that attended was
    well beyond his expectations, \u201Cit was very touching to see so many old friends,
    former Ushra\u2019Khan pilots and foes, to gather for this event\u201D.   \n  \nUgleb,
    who many say was closest to Poreuomai, was also rather shocked: \u201CLook at
    the number of people who came in person, inspired by his tale. His contributions
    to date will be well remembered, as will he.\u201D\u200B\u200B\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Pilots
