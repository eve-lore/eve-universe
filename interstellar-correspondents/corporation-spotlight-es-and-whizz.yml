    effort to bring you more information about your friends and neighbors, as well
    as enemies and rivals, we introduce the first of our semi-regular \"Corporation

    celebrated its 10th anniversary.\n\nThe corporation evolved from a humble smuggling
    operation moving illegal goods within the empires to a full blown manufacturing
    concern providing an end-to-end illegal products solution.\n\nFor the entire month
    there will be celebrations including (but not limited to);\n\n  * Special Illegal
    goods discounts across New Eden.\n  * Instructional classes in the illegal markets
    and the end-to-end production of illegal goods (In Conjunction with EUNI).\n  *
    A special fleet operation for friends, family, customers and the general public
    to join in on.\n\n\n\nFor further information on the celebrations contact Zam
    Zumah and Ni-Zha, \"The Commisar of Truth.\"\n\nTo have your Corporation highlighted
    in this new segment contact ISD Jarrett Pelley with your celebrations and events."
