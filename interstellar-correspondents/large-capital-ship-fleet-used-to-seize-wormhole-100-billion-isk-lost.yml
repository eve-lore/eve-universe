    weeks ago, Aperture Harmonics [AHARM] moved 16 capital ships into a wormhole to
    engage Capital Construction Research [CCRES] for control of the wormhole. The
    inherent instability of wormholes made this task difficult and time consuming.
    \ \n  \nThe mass of capital ships passing through a wormhole can collapse the
    opening after only one or two ships have gone through. In addition, [CCRES] was
    aware of the pending invasion and made every effort to prematurely collapse any
    opening they could scan down. Despite these difficulties, [AHARM] persisted in
    searching out new openings and moving capital ships in, eventually bringing 11
    dreadnaughts and 5 carriers into the wormhole.  \n  \nDespite a slow start to
    the conflict, [CCRES] downed an [AHARM] carrier early on: \"[They] eventually
    let their guard down a bit and opened some opportunities for retaliation, and
    we managed to destroy a carrier that was assisting a subcap blockade of our main
    tower.\" explained Thernys of [CCRES].  \n  \nThe battle raged through the night
    and into the next day. With the large number of [AHARM] capital ships present
    and assistance from mercenary alliance Noir. Mercenary Group, Thernys decided
    to follow a 'scorched earth' policy; \"[We] resorted to self destructing a considerable
    amount of assets, simply to stop them from ending up in hostile hands as spoils.
    [This] speaks to the volume of ships in there - we could not possibly have used
    them all in combat without getting pod killed, and ending up in a station leaving
    everything up for grabs.\" [AHARM] member Seamus McLove reported seeing pilots
    self-destructing [CCRES] assets for as long as eight hours.  \n  \n[CCRES] estimates
    that they lost at least $100 billion in assets, despite getting several tech 3
    ships out of the area. [AHARM] reports losing one carrier, but no other loss information
    has been provided.  \n  \nIn retrospect, [CCRES] feels no bitterness at their
    defeat. Says Thernys, \"As for general commentary, Aharm received information
    on a good time to launch an attack, got their assets in place and bought up some
    extra muscle to make sure the job gets done - this is all well and good and in
    the spirit of [New Eden.] We had our own initiative against them planned and in
    the setup stage, but unfortunately they beat us to the punch.\" adding that; \"The
    characteristics of wspace being such that external aid can be extremely hard to
    reach, especially if a hostile force manages to control access to the static exit.\"
    \ \n  \nBoth sides are adamant about prospering in the near future. Thernys states
    that \"we have already re-established a wspace presence and will continue to be
    a relevant entity there.\" Two step also commented from the [AHARM] perspective:
    \"[Our] future plans include more of this. [We] have heard from a lot of other
    w-space corps that the whole thing made them rethink their own defenses.\"\n\n*
