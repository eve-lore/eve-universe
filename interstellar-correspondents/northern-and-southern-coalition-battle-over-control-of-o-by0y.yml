    Pure Blind -** On April 29, 112, Northern Coalition [NC] forces attacked several
    Southern Coalition [SC] towers, destroying a number of them in a day of activity.
    \ \n  \nImperian, Fleet Commander for the NC forces, had his fleet concentrated
    on their first target, a technetium moon tower, when SC forces headed by IT capsuleers
    intercepted them.  \n  \n[![](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3859/imagethumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=)Responding
    to the number of SC carriers, Imperian had his cap fleet drop back from O-BY0Y
    to a nearby system, where they were able to gather reinforcements before jumping
    back in and engaging the SC forces.  \n  \n\"It was a turkey shoot since we had
    10 titans on the field that doomsdayed their dreadnoughts left and right,\" Imperian
    said.  \n  \nThe SC lost an estimated 39 dreadnoughts in the fighting and 11 interdictors
    as well as what is believed to be 9 towers in a number of systems. It is believed
    the NC lost 3 interdictors and 6 dreadnoughts.[![](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3859/imagetowersthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=)
    \ \n  \nThe war continues between both coalitions with skirmishes daily. Imperian
    expects more from the SC as both sides give and take over the same space.  \n
    \ \n\"At the moment, Pandemic Legion is attacking IT in their home region, Delve,
    so IT have to handle both fronts and can't concentrate giving us fight around
    the clock.\"  \n  \nThe war continues daily, but is at a stalemate as both coalitions
    continue to exchange systems while not yet committing forces to a concerted push.\n\n*
