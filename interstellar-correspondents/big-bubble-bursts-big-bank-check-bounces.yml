    has suffered a 140 million loss even before any members of the public used its
    services. \n\n\u201CNot a single loan has been made,\u201D were the words that
    Tornsoul used to describe the current state of the BIG Bank, \u201Cexcept one
    'test loan' from an interested shareholder. This will be a heavy blow to investors
    who believed they would be getting huge dividends from the scheme after BIG's
    previous success\u201D. What is worse is that the Big Bank has suffered its first
    loss. \u201CIt\u2019s a bit of a shocker, so in fact the BMBE is in the red as
    140M has been spent on eve-radio advertisements, part of the reason is of course
    that 'the word hasn\u2019t spread enough yet.\" \n\nBig Corporation is famous
    across the galaxy for its lottery and also the BIG Deal a blueprint sharing scheme
    that has seen many young corps helped into Battleship production. Tornsoul expects
    to be heavily criticised for the disappointing success of the Big Bank by her
    investors. \n\nBusiness analysts suspect that Big Corporation is wealthy enough
    to survive the loss induced by the Big Bank enterprise. Tornsoul also explains
    that the Big Lottery is still successful and that its beginning weren\u2019t easy
    either. \u201CWell it was a tough beginning but the past year or so it seems to
    have 'levelled' out at a 'reasonable' amount of participants each time. I'd say
    the biggest success of the BIG Lottery is that it's still around after nearly
    3 years. It has mostly seen cash prizes ranging from anywhere from a few million
    ISK, in the VERY early days, up to 1.75B in cash prizes in a single round. Not
    to mention a few very special ships on a few occasions as well, the Imperial Issue
    Apocalypse and the Imperial Issue Armageddon\u201D. \n\nThe second scheme BIG
    made available to the galaxy was the BIG Deal a blueprint part share scheme which
    became a great success. Ms. Tornsoul explained how it had been helping young corps
    for almost three years. \u201CThe BIG Deal is a simply scheme to get into the
    Battleship building business at an 'entry level'. BIG Buys the Battleship BPO's
    and BIG Deal clients - can then buy 'shares' in these - 1/10th shares, and for
    each share they own they get one BPC each week. This is ideal for people not being
    able to fully utilize a full print or for those who simply cannot afford it. Over
    time you can buy all 10 shares and when you get the 10th share BIG hands over
    the researched BPO to you.\u201D \n\nMs. Tornsoul remains hopeful and believes
    that the BIG Bank will take customers when \u201Cword gets around\u201D. The news
    of its disappointing success and initial loss was announced last Sunday and has
    been met with words of encouragement from all factions. \n\nIf you are interested
