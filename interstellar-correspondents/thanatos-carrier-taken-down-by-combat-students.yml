    Syndicate** \\- On 112.04.18, a Thanatos-class carrier flown by ZarnieWoop of
    Huzzah Federation was destroyed by an Agony Unleashed basic combat class.   \n
    \ \nAgony Unleashed has been offering combat training to capsuleers since 110,
    with courses comprising pre-class reading, then a theory lecture followed by a
    fleet exercise escorted by an instructor. On the 18th, the class fleet (which
    mostly comprised frigates) engaged a large gatecamp at Reblier gate in 6C-Z49.
    While the battle was in progress, a Thanatos belonging to ZarnieWhoop of Huzzah
    Federation jumped into the system and joined the fray.   \n  \nZarnieWoop said
    there were reports of 80 frigates moving in the direction of Reblier gate, where
    his corporation had a gatecamp of, he estimated, half a dozen ships.   \n  \n\"I
    stripped out all my fighter drones knowing full well the likely outcome and made
    sure I had no faction mods fitted... I jumped in once all the [frigates] had arrived
    at the gate and started repping a friendly [dominix].\"   \n  \nOlozim, who was
    commanding Agony Unleashed's fleet, explained there were three battlecruisers
    and a Dominix at the Reblier gate in 6-CZ49. \"While the three battlecruisers
    were going down, the Dominix, which was on the far side of the gate... lit a cyno
    field and a Thanatos appeared.\"   \n  \nOlozim ordered the fleet to tackle the
    Thanatos and Dominix; the carrier engaged Triage mode - increasing the speed and
    efficiency of its remote repair modules, but crippling its own ability to defend
    itself or escape - and started repairing the Dominix.   \n  \nThe carrier withstood
    the incoming fire for some time but finally succumbed just as ships arrived from
    the Important Internet Spaceship League to reinforce Huzzah. \"I was in my 4th
    triage cycle, so they had been shooting a while,\" ZarnieWoop stated.   \n  \nAgony
    Unleashed is a combat-focused corporation which also offers combat classes as
    a service to the capsuleer community. It was their Basic class, which aims to
    give new pilots a thorough grounding in the fundamentals of combat, that attacked
    the Huzzah gatecamp and its supporting carrier. \"The basic class was able to
    overcome the reps and kill the cyno Dominix without any support,\" FC Olozim reported.
    Despite his loss, ZarnieWhoop also seemed satisfied with the engagement. \"The
    battle was excellent fun... The loss was not unexpected.\"\n\n* * *\n\nAre you
