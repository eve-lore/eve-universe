    others, the Mercenary Coalition [reset all standings](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=660955)
    and swiftly followed it up by outlining a [new future](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=661207)
    for the Period Basis region as a mercenary-and-friends owned area \u201Cunfettered
    by the agendas of foreign powers\u201D. \n\nThe Tortuga announcement declared
    that \u201Cas of Saturday the 15th of December MC, KIA Alliance, Ev0ke and 0utbreak
    claim the region of Period Basis as our home\u201D and stated as their reason:
    \u201Cwe do this for ourselves, our fellow brethren of space.\u201D It finished
    by claiming that \u201Conce our new home is secure, MC and KIA will be available
    for regular contract work.\u201D \n\nThis latest dramatic twist in the southern
    war is being seen by some as perhaps the largest turning point in a conflict littered
    already with many landmark moments. The removal of the Mercenary Coalition from
    the side of the Band of Brothers means one less group for them to call upon, and
    arguably the greatest loss so far in terms of willing allies. [Leaked instructions](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=661278)
    have alleged that BoB leadership has ordered their alliance to withdraw from most
    of the current theatres of conflict and prepare to make a final, decisive stand
    in Delve. \n\n\u201CAll Catch fleet will be pulled to Delve on Sunday and onwards,
    5-N2EY will be left, V2-VC2 will be left. We keep FAT-6P and 25S-6P. I\u2019m
    sorry, but no one spits on our face like that. Ever.\u201D \n\nWords exchanged
    between the once steadfast allies (or business partners, depending on one\u2019s
    perspective) are already showing signs of an increase in a tension many have observed
    for quite some time. Zakma of the MC advised his BoB counterparts that the move
    could in fact be a blessing in disguise, reducing the number of areas they need
    defend, and indeed reinforcing the key region of Period Basis which neighbors
    Delve. His [statements](http://www.scrapheap-challenge.com/viewtopic.php?t=11368&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=45)
    however were laced with an animosity that is fast coming to define at least parts
    of the new MC/BoB relationship. \n\n\u201CIn the end, we do what is in our best
    interest. If BoB\u2019s leadership thought about this a bit more, they'd see that
    this probably benefits them in the long run. Their south side border is shut off\u2026they
    have a region less to defend\u2026However, in typical BOB style they'll probably
    try and go against us. Opening yet another front for themselves, and weakening
    the defences on the other ones\u2026their ego just can't take it so their leadership
    will ultimately be their downfall.\u201D \n\nBoB\u2019s leader SirMolle was quick
    to retort, claiming that since his alliance had come under direct attack from
    the MC and was thus being immediately threatened, they would not simply ignore
    it or leave the MC\u2019s actions free of consequence. \n\n\u201CThere\u2019s
    a huge difference between asking \u2018Hey, guys, can we have this space here
    for XXXX and XXXX so that we feel secure?\u2019 or sending in 250 pilots with
    40 dreads and attacking head on. I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s us who needs
    to do the thinking here, if you for one second think that we are going to sit
    idle while _you_ attack us, you\u2019ve got another thing coming. \n\nMake no
    mistake, this is _your_ doing, and no one else\u2019s.\u201D \n\nSome of the first
    public signs of tension between the MC and Band of Brothers were seen months ago
    during the assault on the Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate in Catch, when GoonSwarm
    leaked [internal discussions](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=603519)
    between MC revealing a frank and robust debate amongst them about BoB\u2019s tactics
    and their worth as allies and clients. In a telling exchange, leader of the MC
    Seleene had this to say at the time: \n\n\u201COne last thing to any of you who
    doubt it - My loyalty is to the MC, to _you_. BoB is in no way, shape or form
    in control of me or this alliance\u2026Don't think for a minute that MC is on
    anyone's strings. There are always plans within plans and I'm not one to tie our
    destiny to any specific path. The MC will always adapt and overcome.\u201D \n\nIn
    yet another leaked [internal communication](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=661207&page=3#81),
    the CEO of Black Nova Corp Coranor was alleged to have labelled the MC as traitors
    and warned his alliance mates to expect harder times ahead, including the loss
    of stations. Despite this he maintained that BoB would and should continue to
    fight regardless and not buckle under the increasing pressure. \n\n\u201DMC is
    probably going to hit us tonight in Period Basis. Traitorous bastards, to be honest.
    The goons and company are hitting us tonight in Catch. Pretty much every northern
    alliance is due to hit us tomorrow in Fountain\u2026stations are gonna go damn
    quick once this kicks off. \n\nWe [have] fights on our doorstep every day now\u2026they
    think that they can actually drive us out of delve and kill us. They think they're
    actually better than us. They think we're panicking\u2026.We're the un-killable
    alliance and we're gonna bleed them for every system they take. If we lose our
    outposts then we move to the [Blood Raider] stations and take them back. We're
    not leaving delve\u2026Delve is the Alamo\u2026\u201D\n\nIt remains to be seen
    just what the fallout from this latest turn of events will be. Some are expecting
    the MC to consolidate their space and then open up for business, claiming that
    it would be unlikely for them to push on further against BoB outside of Period
    Basis without a contract. What exactly any potential new contracts could bring
    however, assuming they do secure the region, remains anyone\u2019s guess. Speculation
    is already flying. Some are predicting that MC\u2019s capital fleet just may enter
    Delve in their first contract against BoB, whilst others claim that if BoB goes
    down, MC will be the next target regardless of these recent actions \u2013 a suggestion
    that one of GoonSwarm\u2019s leading pilots The Mittani has [refuted](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=660955&page=6#173).\n\n\u201CIf
    MC goes through with their plan\u2026and gets the hell out of the war, they're
    no longer on the list of 'people who make me an unhappy mitten'\u201D \n\nAs with
    much at this early point in the next stage of the southern conflict, it remains
    unclear whether of not his words will hold true in time. For the moment, all eyes
    are on Period Basis, watching with anticipation of just how deeply these latest
    changes will affect the conflict at large."
