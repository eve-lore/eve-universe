- body: "Hamish of the Tribal Trust of Pator issued a statement regarding the latest
    news piece involving the Ushra'Khan alliance, a Minmatar freedom fighter organisation.
    I have chosen to re-print the statement in full. You can find the original piece
    on the GalNet forums [here](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=155073).
    \  \n  \n\"I would just like to correct some misunderstandings that seem to have
    snuck into the piece. First I'd like to point out that the reporter in question
    was present for the escort at our invitation and was provided with information
    and access to involved parties if she had any further questions. Wink   \n  \nThe
    Imperial Issue Armageddon is NOT currently in the posession of Tribal Trust of
    Pator and Ushra'Khan, it remains in the hands of its owner Icarus Starkiller.
    (Until Friday the 4th of March Very Happy)   \n  \nThe escort we provided our
    good friend Icarus, through a great deal of Amarr Empire space from Tividu to
    Pator as he piloted the great vessel was not a show of defiance as the respected
    Interstellar Correspondent Emilianne Bouteiller dramatically proclaimed it, rather
    a show of respect to him and the nobility of his intentions.   \n  \nThe hand-off
    ceremony has not yet taken place (and was never planned to so soon) due to bureaucratic
    scheduling between all involved parties, as well as the need for tight security
    due to the considerable interest our enemies the Amarrians and others are expected
    to have in this event.   \n  \nFinally I'd like to thank the reporter for the
    interest she's shown in our efforts and bringing our war on Amarr closer to the
    eyes of the public.\" There you have it. Our apologies for the mistake."
