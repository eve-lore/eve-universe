- body: "Syndicate \u2013 For Goonfleet, it was just another week of business as usual:
    Replenishing depleted equipment stores, reviewing attack strategies, and of course,
    war declarations. This time, the focus of hostilities was the Kr0m corporation,
    but with such a busy operations docket, no one seemed to notice. \n\n\u201CKROM?
    I've never heard of KROM,\u201D said Doctor Draw, Chief Diplomat and Vice CEO
    of Goonfleet. \u201COh, wait, I do recall something about their corporation threatening
    us. I never really noticed what happened with that\u201D. \n\nDraw eventually
    recalled that the short-lived war was declared accidentally while Goonfleet CEO
    Remedial was distracted with the arrival of several exotic dancers. However, Kr0m
    maintains that the war was declared in retaliation for the destruction of several
    Goonfleet ships, and hinted that they intend to renew open hostilities very soon.
    Capsuleer Evil Edna of Kr0m relates the following: \u201CWe moved into their home
    system and started killing their miners, they seemed to take offense to that,
    so I guess they wanted to try and take revenge on us, but it didn\u2019t go so
    well\u201D. \n\nGoonfleet has approximately 800 capsuleers, whereas Kr0m has less
    than 50. But the large difference in numbers is no concern to Evil Edna. \u201CNumbers
    aren\u2019t really a substitute for good piloting ability and tactics,\u201D he
    explains. \u201CI\u2019m confident that we will tactically outmaneuver them, smartbombs
    help and I\u2019m confident we can smacktalk the morale right out of them.\u201D
    \n\nDoctor Draw maintains a much different view, emphasizing that their success
    relies on their brazen willingness to sacrifice ships in exchange for a sure kill.
    \u201CI know some corporations scoff at the inexperience of many of our pilots,
    but with each new recruitment wave our inexperienced pilots become experienced
    mentors for the next wave,\u201D he explained. \u201CFrankly, I'm not too concerned
    with what our enemies think as long as they continue to fail to stop us. If they
    want to brag about the number of frigates and cruisers they blow up, that's their
    choice. Some of our enemies do appreciate us for our willingness to fight even
    when the odds are against us. We will allow ten frigates to engage a single battleship,
    HAC or even an interceptor in a large enemy fleet knowing full well that most
    or all of those frigates will be lost. If they kill the Interceptor we consider
    it worth it and the loss of ten frigates is insignificant\u201D. \n\nGoonfleet\u2019s
    aggressive recruitment policy accounts for the corporation\u2019s huge number
    advantage. Doctor Draw explained that they recruit from a select membership pool
    that yields 200 - 300 new members per round. After each round, the entire corporation
    assists in teaching the new recruits crucial lessons about capsuleer realities
    that the academies do not. In particular, they focus on the power of group tactics
    and the perils of traveling alone beyond empire borders. But despite the counseling,
    it often takes hard knocks to learn the skills required for survival out in the
    deep. \u201CAny reasonably experienced pilot can traverse Syndicate by themselves,\u201D
    Doctor Draw explains. \u201CFor our inexperienced pilots this sort of thing can
    be difficult, but they will learn even if it means waking up in a cloning chamber\u201D.
    \n\nAt the moment, the primary base of operations for Goonfleet is Syndicate,
    although they have taken a keen interest in the activities of friendly alliances
    such as The Five and Black Omega Security. Draw stated that they are eager to
    participate in a larger conflict, and that they would aid The Five if the war
    in the north escalates. \u201CWe always welcome a challenge,\u201D he explains.
    \u201CWe have a lot of respect to foes who stand and fight rather than hide or
    run at the first sign of an even match\u201D. \n\nBut the operations docket of
    Goonfleet is not entirely filled with war preparations. A wedding ceremony entry
    stands out like a titan in the midst of a frigate fleet. It states:   \n\u201CMarriage
    vows are to be exchanged in system M2-CF1 on 14 February at 02:00 hours. Guest
    list: All corporations are welcome. BYO spirits.\u201D If your corporation is
    interested in attending, please note the security of this system. The Interstellar
    Correspondents are not liable for any incidents."
