- body: "YC 113.09.01 - YC 113.09.30\n\nSeptember saw continued pressure from White
    Noise, Red Alliance and their allies being put on Against All Authorities (AAA).
    AAA lost several stations, with a total of 16 stations falling to the attackers
    this month. Despite the amount of territory exchanging hands, the number of capsuleer
    ships being destroyed in the process was relatively low, totalling only 8,765
    for the month compared to 19,420 in August.  \n  \nDelve however has regained
    the top spot that it had held for several months prior to August, coming in at
    17,733 ship losses there this month. Whilst the main alliances involved continued
    to be Morsus Mihi and Brick Squad, both TEST Alliance and Goonswarm also moved
    in to take part in the ongoing near free-for-all.  \n  \nMorsus Mihi and RED.Overlord
    both lost substantial holdings within Delve, Morsus Mihi to Goonswarm and RED.Overlord
    to The Polaris Syndicate. With such flipping of sovereignty on-going, it's hard
    to see any stability in the near future for Delve.\n\nThis month, DED is declassifying
    it's records for the numbers of alliance capsuleer vessels that CONCORD have been
    forced to destroy due to various crimes, mainly due to opening fire on an innocent
    pilot within high security space. The following five alliances committed the most
    violations of the law:  \n  \n<table>  \n<tr>  \n<td>\n\n\n\nGoonSwarm\n\n\n</td>
