    Delve** \\- Triumvirate. Alliance [TRI] lost a titan last week as it fell victim
    to some bad luck and a waiting GoonSwarm [OHGOD] trap. The Avatar-class Titan,
    piloted by Sokra, a member of the DOOM. Corporation and [TRI], was tackled, and
    destroyed during an attempt to save a [TRI] tower.  \n  \nAccording to Sokra,
    \"[the] target was to defend our staging [tower] at [planet] 9-[moon]22, with
    double [doomsday].\" The intent of the two titans was to deprive [OHGOD] dreadnoughts
    of their support fleet, \"but goons bridged in only light support and bubblers.\"
    The double doomsday firing only removed a handful of support ships from the field.
    With the titans out of offensive action, Goonswarm quickly entered the system
    with the intent to deploy bubbles. Sokra's titan was bumped by the second titan,
    which knocked Sokra out of his intended warp-out alignment. The delay in realignment
    was enough for [OHGOD] to successfully tackle Sokra. A valiant effort by the [TRI]
    support fleet was made to clear the [OHGOD] ships that had pinned down their titan.
    In what was intended to be a surprise attack on the [OHGOD] support fleet, turned
    for the worst as the titan went down.  \n  \nA member of the attacking fleet,
    VENOM2k99 of Legion Du Lys comments about the operation, \"we had a strategy to
    'bait' the titan... we did expect at least two because they wanted to kill our
    support BS fleet, which most of them will tank minimum 1 DD (fleet bs fit).\"
    \ \n  \nThe newly commissioned Avatar was only a few days old, a very recent addition
    to the [TRI] fleet. While the loss is substantial, Sokra puts it into perspective,
    \"We will keep going and [TRI] is far from being low on [morale] about the loss\"\n\n###
