- body: "The Ashen Lion Mining and Production Consortium ran a racing event back in
    June and, after a tough few months, they're back on track, planning another event
    for this Sunday.  \n  \nI had the opportunity to speak to Benilopax, CEO of the
    ALMPC, last night and he's very excited about the coming event which will run
    through most of the day, starting early in the afternoon. The two main races,
    to be held in the Kino system, are scheduled for 17:00 Eve Time and 19:00 Eve
    Time, both promising impressive rewards for first place. The first race will be
    a Non-Warp race around the station in Kino and the second will be a Warp race
    around the constellation.  \n  \nBenilopax is dedicated to bringing regular racing
    events to the Eve galaxy, so if you feel the need for speed, join channel \"Almpc
    Racing\" or contact Benilopax himself.   \n  \nYou can read the public announcement
