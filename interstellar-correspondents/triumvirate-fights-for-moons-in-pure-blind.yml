    doomsday fire on over 100 hostile battleships](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftriumvirate-alliance.com%2F%3Fa%3Dkill_related%26kll_id%3D3538850)
    last Monday. The usage of two Titans turned the tide for the combined force of
    Mostly Harmless and Tau Ceti Federation.  \n  \nAccording to iNZi of Triumvirate.,
    the battle commenced after approximately 100 hostile capitals started to reinforce
    two Triumvirate. moon-mining towers in GA-P6C. Triumvirate. immediately called
    in their own capital fleet to counter-attack.  \n  \nThe GA-P6C solar system contains
    two high-end moons - one dysprosium and one promethium, both of which can guarantee
    a steady income of ISK to their owner. Many of the moons in Pure Blind became
    unclaimed after a large amount of pilots left the Imperial Republic Of the North
    [IRON] earlier this month.  \n  \nA source within Tau Ceti Federation explained
    that, finding themselves outnumbered by Triumvirate., their fleet withdrew, but
    when the Triumvirate. capital forces began attacking a Northern Coalition control
    tower, they reshipped into sniper battleships and returned.  \n  \nMostly Harmless
    and Tau Ceti Federation deployed warp disruption fields and tackled most of the
    hostile capitals on the field, picking off five dreadnaughts and one carrier with
    long-range fire in the hour-long battle that ensued.  \n  \nThe segregated positions
    of the two fleet presented an opportunity, and Triumvirate. deployed highly-mobile
    interdictors to tackle the enemy fleet with warp disruption probes, then warped
    in an Avatar and a Leviathan which doomsdayed the battleships, killing over 100
    in twin-waves of destructive force. The final numbers for the fight show approximately
    250 kills for the Triumvirate. alliance, and nearly 50 kills made by Mostly Harmless
    and Tau Ceti Federation.  \n  \nWhile Triumvirate. inflicted heavier casualties
    in financial terms in Monday's fight, a source in Tau Ceti Federation says that
    they are determined to capture all the high end moons Triumvirate. claimed after
    IRON's decline last month, a comment showed true as Mostly Harmless today seized
    sovereignty of the system from Triumvirate.  \n  \nMeanwhile, battles contiunue
    to flare up between the two sides all across Pure Blind. The Interstellar Correspondents
    will stay with this story and bring you updates as they arise.\n\n* * *\n\nAre
