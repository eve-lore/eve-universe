- body: "Many billions of isk were wagered on this year\u2019s final of the Alliance
    Tournament. Most of those wagers were placed for personal gain, but Seor Engis
    and his [AURA] Alliance decided to make a difference in the lives of those without
    such deep pockets. \n\n\u201CWe were only a few people [in the alliance] actively
    watching and discussing that evening and none of us felt like making huge bets.
    Normally I don't bet on things I can't influence, but we agreed the winner should
    donate the money to charity.\u201D \n\nAs talk of the bet evolved, it was finally
    decided that the winner would receive a fully loaded industrial ship filled with
    \u201Cbasic necessities; food, water, and some of the things that makes life worth
    living...\u201D to be given to the charity of the winner\u2019s choice. \n\nSeor
    turned over the winnings to the Sisters of Eve. When asked why he chose SoE he
    told us; \u201CI've worked for the sisters before, and have involved myself in
    their work in the Ani constellation. Seemed like the natural choice...\u201D \n\nThe
    items donated to the Sisters of Eve are as follows: \n\n  * 5000 tobacco\n  *
    10000 quafe\n  * 4500 antibiotics\n  * 1000 spirits\n  * 3300 oxygen\n  * 7000
    water\n  * 19000 wheat\n  * 16800 frozen food\n\n\n\nNo further information is
    currently available as to how the goods will be distributed."
