- body: "Former ISS director, Serenity Steele, is due to release a hard copy of the
    results of her stellar cartography expeditions. This cartographic journal of the
    expedition will contain details of every region of the known universe. It is presented
    in a format designed for capsuleers to use as they pilot their spacecraft, whether
    they are in fleet formation or on solo roaming. \n\nThe book itself is intended
    by Steele to reduce the prevalence of so called \"smack talk\" on the intergalactic
    network relating to territory ownership and disputes. It is expected is will be
    available for capsuleers to purchase soon via the GalNet. \n\nSteele\u2019s map
    book will allow pilots and GalNet observers to monitor the strength and prevalence
    of a given alliance at a single glance, as well as to investigate each of the
    other statistics currently available in the pilots' navigation console. \n\nWith
    a comprehensive translation from a ship-fitted 3D display unit to a portable 2D
    display, the map book provides a handy tool for any pilot that chooses to purchase
    one and further aids the ability of capsuleers to circumnavigate space safely
    and efficiently. \n\n_External GalNet References_  \n[Eve Strategic Maps: Official
