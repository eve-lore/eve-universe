    know something of the Burn Eden Corporation. Each having their own varied opinions
    on the small group of pilots and what could be described as the comfortable level
    of notoriety they have achieved within the capsuleer community.   \n  \nCurrently
    operating in the Geminate region on the eastern fringes of the Eve star cluster,
    Burn Eden has drawn the public\u2019s attention on the GalNet with its current
    hostilities against the Big Blue Alliance and other Geminate residents. Earlier
    this week TheDragoon \u2013 a Burn Eden pilot spoke in an interview with the Interstellar
    Correspondents about his corporation.   \n  \nTheDragoon explained that the backbone
    of Burn Eden\u2019s member base originated from a corporation known as The Fenix
    Alliance \u2013 formerly of a fringe space alliance known as the Ganksta Nation.
    He went on to explain that Burn Eden came into existence after the dispersion
    of Ganksta Nation: \u201CWith our experience we realised that even though our
    numbers were thin we could become the combat force of the future, we were free
    from political hassle and could do anything we wanted.\u201D   \n  \nWhen asked
    of Burn Eden\u2019s goals he commented that the former TFA pilots wanted to show
    that a capsuleer corporation could not only survive but make ISK from what he
    described as \u201Cpure combat.\u201D TheDragoon went on to add that while BE\u2019s
    fundamental goals had never changed they had done a \u201Cvariety of things to
    add flavour\u201D to their occupation such as mercenary work, empire wars, and
    conquering territory and stations.   \n  \nSpeaking on the subject of Burn Eden\u2019s
    somewhat unique combat philosophy, TheDragoon explained that a standard BE fleet
    consisted mainly of Raven battleships equipped for both long and short range combat.
    While utilising the ship\u2019s medium hard points for warp drive disruption and
    other electronic warfare therefore \u201Callowing us to fight against a far superior
    enemy force.\u201D He went on to comment on how their fleets made extensive use
    of \u201Cdedicated tackler ships to strike amongst the confusion\u201D and pick
    off enemy ships.   \n  \n\u201COur setups are primarily focused on working together
    as a group. We believe this is the reason we have been so successful\u201D He
    later added.   \n  \nThe extensive use of the warp core stabilization module in
    Burn Eden\u2019s tactics has been a source of much criticism on the GalNet from
    enemies and observers alike. When asked to comment on the use of this module -
    which is used to counter the negative effects of warp field disruptors, TheDragoon
    explained that they were used to allow BE to fight against the odds with larger
    enemy numbers than their own.   \n  \n\u201CThe whole debate over warp core stabilizers
    is comical. All we are doing is using the best modules, setups and tactics to
    win. And it works!\u201D He went on to remark that as a somewhat renegade corporation,
    Burn Eden was uncaring about what others said about them. Explaining that though
    \u201Cit\u2019s frustrating, even for us, when a target gets away because of stabilizers\u201D
    their tactics had evolved to utilise dedicated \u2018tackler\u2019 vessels. \u201CWhile
    Jo Alliance still fancies taking us on his crusader as they do more damage, damage
    is useless unless you can tackle your opponent.\u201D   \n  \nTheDragoon explained
    that Burn Eden had used these tactics to successfully \u201Cfight every major
    alliance in EVE.\u201D This most recently included Firmus Ixion, Ascendant Frontier,
    and The Big Blue. \u201CNot one of them has been able to oppose us,\u201D He added
    \u201CThe only thing anyone seems to be able to do is vastly outnumber us to try
    and save face.\u201D   \n  \nCommenting on their reasoning for hostilities against
    The Big Blue, TheDragoon explained that Burn Eden was \u201Cvery concerned\u201D
    about The Big Blue allowing pilots who \u201Chave not had their blood shed\u201D
    in combat before into the Geminate region. Stating that the resource rich fringe
    regions should not be \u201Chanded out on a plate as Big Blue are trying to do,
    this to Burn Eden is an insult to all the capsule pilots of Eve.\u201D He went
    to remark that the war was at present in very much in BE\u2019s favour.   \n  \nWhen
    asked to comment on the status of the conflict, Omber Zombie of The Big Blue explained
    that Burn Eden was currently trapped in a dead end system and \u201Ctheir potential
    for damage is somewhat nullified\u201D He went on to remark that \u201Cwhile we
    may not be blowing their ships up, they have been effectively neutralized for
    now.\u201D Omber Zombie also later averred that he had yet to hear of any incident
    of Burn Eden accomplishing anything that would really hurt The Big Blue.   \n
    \ \nDiscussing his opinions of Burn Eden, Omber Zombie explained that \u201Ctheir
    tactics, whilst cowardly, are effective. Their use of electronic warfare and ranged
    attacks make them difficult to pin down.\u201D Commenting that they seemed to
    prefer to avoid close combat.   \n  \nRepresentatives of two of Burn Eden\u2019s
    former enemies were also asked to give opinions of the corporation. Adhamhnon
    of Ascendant Frontier explained that \u201C[ASCN] find them to be insignificant
    to the operations of a major 0.0 alliance, and of little importance in the overall
    scheme of things.\u201D Commenting that while good at outnumbering their targets,
    their \u201Crun and vanish\u201D tactics left a lot to be desired. \u201COn a
    threat scale I'd consider them a nuisance\u201D He said.   \n  \nFarsenir \u2013
    A pilot within Firmus Ixion was in general agreement with these statements, maintaining
    that Burn Eden \u201Cappear to favour targets of opportunity versus organized
    opposition.\u201D He went on to say that they were \u201Cvery efficient, but hardly
    anything that can worry an alliance.\u201D   \n  \nOn the final subject of Burn
    Eden\u2019s future plans, TheDragoon explained that BE simply intended to grow
    and continue to pursue their original goals. \u201CBurn Eden will be around in
    some form or other until then end of time. Our unique fighting style, which at
    first dismissed, has always attracted pilots to us.\u201D   \n  \nHe added with
    some degree of finality that \u201Cnobody is safe; our terror will be known throughout
    the four corners of the galaxy.\u201D"
