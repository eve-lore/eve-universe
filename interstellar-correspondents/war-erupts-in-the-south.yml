- body: "PARAGON SOUL - Last week saw a breakdown in the relationship between the
    two alliances Tribal Souls and Ascendant Frontier. Breaches of confidence, combined
    with resource and outpost placement disputes, reportedly led to a slowly building
    crescendo of diplomatic ill-will. The end result: a capital fleet supported by
    hundreds of smaller vessels was deployed by ASCN for precision strikes in key
    systems of the Paragon Soul region. Facing little resistance, they quickly conquered
    and destroyed all of Tribal Souls's infrastructure, leaving the latter stranded
    in a deep-space region without any friendly ports of call. \n\n\u201CThe current
    situation is that Tribal Souls has lost all of its stations and all of its space,\u201D
    commented Bjoern Bitter, Chief Diplomat of the Tribal Souls Alliance. \n\nCyvok,
    leader of ASCN, stated: \u201CThe timing of this war was 100% wrong... it has
    set ASCN back weeks in our bid to upgrade our core systems. Our goal was simple:
    once fighting started, we needed to end the war as quickly as possible.\u201D
    \n\nAny single reason for the recent hostilities is difficult to ascertain. Statements
    from both sides quickly revealed that the lead-up to war was a mix of issues,
    although the greatest damage seems to have been done by a refusal on Tribal Souls\u2019s
    part to merge with ASCN. \n\n\u201CWe didn't want to give everything we had built
    to ASCN rule,\u201D said Bitter. \u201CThat left only one option, war.\u201D \n\nWhen
    asked if the current desperate situation was preferable to a merger he became
    animated, stating strongly that \u201CNo, this is not preferable to a merger,
    but we see no option.\u201D Bitter argued that \u201Cthe merger was not an option,
    as many corps could not merge.\u201D He cited the prerequisites for corporate
    access to Ascendant Frontier as the reason. \u201C100 member minimum, 22 Billion
    ISK, no... There was no choice.\u201D \n\nSpeaking on the same issue, Cyvok stated
    that \u201Cour [ASCN's] long term plans have always been to move towards the unification
    of Tribal Souls, a merger where they would disband and their member Corps would
    join ASCN.\u201D These long-term plans initially posed no threat to the relationship
    between the two alliances, as for many months ASCN had, despite repeated invitations,
    respected the continued wish of Tribal Souls to remain a sovereign entity. It
    was not until the leaking of a high-level discussion between key ASCN individuals
    about the possibility of forcing a merger that a large hurdle to the two entities'
    peaceful coexistence was created. \n\n\u201CThe discussion was no more than 12
    hours old when, due to an administrative error in our communications security
    systems, the information was leaked to Tribal Souls,\u201D Cyvok stated. \u201CObviously
    it totally inflamed their alliance, as it rightly should have, to be fair.\u201D
    From that point on, a relationship already strained by recent arguments over a
    multitude of issues started to deteriorate. \n\n\u201CTheir reaction to the news,
    and the way in which they received it, lead both our alliances down a rather irreversible
    path. Some bailed out of their alliance just at hearing the news, others left
    Paragon Soul without even attempting to find out what happened,\u201D said Cyvok.
    \u201CBy the time the diplomats stepped in, both the ASCN and Tribal member bases
    were so furious that war was more or less the only option left.\u201D When asked
    why the situation was as volatile as it was, he stated, \u201CASCN had lost all
    respect and trust in the members of Tribal... and I am sure the feeling was mutual
    on their side.\u201D \n\nWhat the future holds still remains to be seen. Cyvok
    was reluctant to declare the war won, despite widespread public opinion, even
    admissions from Tribal Souls members, that in fact it had been. \u201CI can assure
    you that it\u2019s definitely not 100% over. Once ASCN gains official sovereignty
    the battle for the region will be effectively over, but behind the scenes, communications
    from Tribal Souls are laced with all sorts of plans to regroup and counter attack
    at a later date.\u201D \n\nBitter gave no such impression when he spoke of Tribal\u2019s
    future. \u201CMany of us want to start afresh and learn from our errors,\u201D
    he stated. \u201COne corporation is moving out to form its own alliance... and
    several others have accepted offers to move to new alliances.\u201D \n\nWhen asked
    about the future of some Tribal Souls members still remaining in the region, Cyvok
    said that discussions with the remaining pilots were still ongoing, and that at
    this time no details could be provided. He did however, spell out plans for the
    region itself. \u201CWe have no other powerful allies we trust to secure the region
    long term. ASCN core space is a bit overcrowded, so we have decided to hold the
    region as our own.\u201D"
