    pilot and a high-ranking agent of Republic University has resulted in a trend
    that could send the price of the coveted Miner II laser \u201Cfalling very, very
    soon\u201D. Interstellar reporters have confirmed that the pilot\u2014who is part
    of a corporation with only seven members\u2014has obtained an authentic Miner
    II blueprint so far the first one in the game. Until now, the Techell Corporation
    had an been one of the few confirmed suppliers of this advanced technology, using
    two unlimited licenses that they had obtained.  \n\n\n\u201CUntil I had it in
    the factory, I didn\u2019t really believe it\u201D, marveled the freelancer, who
    for ethical reasons will have his name and corporation withheld from this news
    release. Although the technology was introduced by the reclusive Jovians, this
    original copy was handed to the pilot by his Minmatar agent as a reward for his
    \u201Cexemplary service to Republic University\u201D\u2014specifically, the successful
    completion of almost 300 missions. When asked why he decided to approach the Interstellar
    Reporters, he replied \u201CWe'd like nothing more than to see TTI and Techell\u2019s
    hold broken\u2026we wanted everyone to know that [their] reign is coming to an
    end.\u201D  \n\n\nAsked specifically about the massive markup from production
    cost (50,000 isk)--a public relations nightmare for Techell--he answered that
    \u201Cin the very short term, we intend to follow a similar pricing model\u201D,
    again emphasizing that they were a small corporation and \u201Cnot amazingly rich\u201D.
    But he still insists that the likelihood of a significant drop in the retail price
    of the high-yield mining laser is imminent. The sudden generosity of megacorporation
    agents, who already have a track record for awarding high-profile items such as
    cybernetic implants to worthy freelancers, indicates that more originals will
    be released.  \n\n\nThe anonymous corporation is planning an advertising campaign
    that is expected to begin within the next 48 hours. \n\n**IC Editors Note:** Interstellar
