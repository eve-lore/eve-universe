    on August 23rd and 24th from 15:00 to 20:00 UTC.\n\n![](http://cdn1.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/66189/1/AT_XII_logo-banner.png)\n\nAfter
    a [furious first weekend](http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/eve-online-news/alliance-tournament-xii-review-of-the-first-weekend/)
    with thrilling fights and some spectacular matches, the second weekend of the
    [Alliance Tournament XII](http://community.eveonline.com/community/alliance-tournament/)
    organized by CCP is about to kick off with teams already fighting against elimination
    from the tournament.\n\nAs the Alliance Tournament is a double elimination tournament,
    each team can lose up to one match, but the second lost match leads then to instant
    elimination (except for the semifinals and finals, they are best-of-three and
    best-of-five matches).  During the first weekend we saw teams getting sorted into
    the losers bracket (one match lost) or remaining in the winners bracket (no match
    lost), but from now on it is all-or-nothing for the 32 teams in the losers bracket.\n\nDuring
    this second tournament weekend on August 23rd  and 24th we will see action packed
    matches between some of the finest and most renowned alliances to be found in
    EVE Online giving their best to win. The Alliance Tournament spans in total over
    the course of four weekends.\n\nAll matches of the Alliance Tournament will be
    broadcasted and commented live by our tournament experts on the [CCP Twitch.tv
    channel](http://www.twitch.tv/ccp); the free broadcast begins on August 23rd and
    24th at 15:00 UTC - don't miss it!\n\n###   \n\n###  _Alliance Tournament XII_\n\n####
