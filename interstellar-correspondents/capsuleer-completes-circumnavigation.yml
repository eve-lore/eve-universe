    Eden** \\- DevilDogUSMC has [completed his second circumnavigation of New Eden](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/radar/follow/0gpHUVtjJPc79A1X)
    in less than 12 hours.  \n  \nThe venture saw him manually navigate through 25
    regions, including Delve, Fountain and Cache, and make a total of 435 system jumps,
    beginning in Fluekele, Sinq Laison and finishing in 4C-B7X, Outer Ring.  \n  \nDevilDogUSMC
    had hoped that his second circumnavigation would attract more capsuleers, and
    afterward he claimed he was satisfied with how it went: \"I had a greater positive
    reaction in 0.0 than I thought I would ever get. From all regions.\"  \n  \nIt
    didn't completely go without the odd scare, as DevilDogUSMC revealed: \"In J9SH-A,
    I had a group of assault frigates and battlecruisers try to ram me off the gate
    right before I was jumping.\"  \n  \nOn future ventures, he had this to say: \"I
    would do it again but for now I have to rest. I plan on helping young corperations
    learn to manually navigate and to use tactics to help stay alive in unsecure space.\"
    \ \n  \nThe circumnavigation was completed in a Proteus, named Iza Fire. He has
    decided to keep the ship, as it \"means way too much\" to him.\n\n### Galnet References\n\n[DevilDogUSMC
