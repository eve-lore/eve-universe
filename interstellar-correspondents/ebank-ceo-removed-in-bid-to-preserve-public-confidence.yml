    \\- In a stunning move the board of EBank has announced the immediate removal
    of their current CEO, EBANK Ricdic. In a statement released not long ago they
    revealed he was being removed \"for misconduct that can damage public confidence
    in EBANK\".  \n  \n[![EBANK Ricdic](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3121/ebankricdicthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F3121%2Febankricdic.png)The
    decision was reached after an \"impromptu meeting\" by the board, at which EBANK
    Athre was promoted to fill in as CEO on an interim basis until a more permanent
    solution could be agreed. This process was part of a contingency plan that had
    previously been devised, and now implemented.  \n  \nMeanwhile, EBANK customers
    cannot currently deposit new funds, a situation which apparently is set to continue
    for up to a week while the enterprise reorganises. Access to accounts remains,
    however, in all other regards.  \n  \nAelisha, a customer of EBANK, had been expecting
    Ricdic's departure and was concerned how the information had leaked out: _\"It's
    the fact that either a leak or a premeditated 'easing the transit' rumour got
    out from EBANK and it just seems a little unprofessional - when you're trusting
    people with money, trust is a big issue.\"_ When asked if she still feels safe
    leaving her ISK with EBANK, she commented _\"I do not at the moment, but I also
    have faint hopes that it will see a shake up and the return of higher interest
    accounts to stimulate existing customers.\"_  \n  \nJi Sama of Sex Drugs And Rock'N'Roll,
    however, continues to have faith in the organization: _\"Thank you EBANK, you
    still have my trust... Athre is upstanding and would never steal from anyone.\"_
    \ \n  \nThe bank still continues to honour all withdrawals against monies they
    received prior to Ricdic's misconduct.  \n  \nThe Interstellar Correspondents
    will bring you further updates from EBANK as they become available.\n\n### GalNet
