    pilots fly across the starry skies oblivious of the forgotten wonders waiting
    to be rediscovered. \n\nEpic monuments, abandoned stations, crumbling ruins, weird
    and wonderful spacial phenomena, just some of the sights waiting to be seen. \n\nFor
    those pilots who want to experience something different, for those who are wanting
    to capture the spirit of adventure and exploration, here is a collection of some
    of New Edens most important natural, man-made and other mysteriously fabricated
    landmarks and points of interest. \n\nSetting off from the remote port of Polaris
    we will travel in each of the cardinal directions documenting our finds. \n\nOn
    our final leg of the journey what could possibly surpass what we have seen so
    far? \n\n* * *\n\n**Journeying Into The East**\n\n* * *\n\n__Divinity's Edge__\n\n
    \ * In the early stages of Amarr expansion through space they encountered Divinity's
    Edge - a huge void with little in way of solar systems or other stellar bodies.
    For a long time they believed this was the end of the galaxy and that beyond this
    point, nothing existed. Centuries later the Great Wildlands were discovered and
    this theory was abolished, although the name for the place has remained. \n\n

    Of God__\n\n  * Built by the megalomaniac emperor Zaragram II some 2000 years
    ago, intended to be the home of the living god, namely himself. Zaragram set out
    to uproot and eradicate many of the most sacred traditions of the Amarrians, replacing
    them by his own mad ideas on divinity. He called his city Mezagorm, meaning Vision
    of God. Eventually, he was assassinated and later emperors, under pressure from
    the clergy, did their utmost to bury his memory. The ruins of Zaragram's city
    still exist, haunted by ghosts and pirates. \n\n  * _Entered Via_ : N/A \n  *

    decades ago the Amarr Empire was desperate to improve their relations with the
    other empires, mainly to increase trade and tourism. One of the projects they
    embarked on was to build the Myridian Strip vacation resort, located above the
    plasma clouds in the Ezzara system. From an aesthetic point of view the location
    was perfect: stunningly beautiful and exotic. The resort itself was also a wonder
    of the world and for the first few years of its operation tourists from all over
    flocked to it. But the location had one fatal flaw, one that was to manifest itself
    less than 5 years after it opened: it was located too close to Blood Raider space.
    The Blood Raiders eagerly jumped on the opportunity presented to them on their
    doorstep and hundreds perished in their initial raid. Not long after the resort
    was permanently closed and since then only inhabitants it has had are Blood Raiders,
    reveling in their prized asset. \n\n  * _Entered Via_ : N/A \n  * _CONCORD / DED
    Rating_ : N/A \n\n\n* * *\n\n__Golgothan Fields__\n\n  * The Minmatar Rebellion
    saw many battles, both on ground and in space. The largest of the space battles
    took place in the Ennur system a few weeks after the start of the rebellion. The
    main Amarr battle fleet had returned from Jovian space and intended to break the
    power of the rebels once and for all by sweeping through their core systems. The
    Minmatars met the Amarrians with everything they got. The battle was fierce and
    lasted for hours. In the end the Minmatars withdrew and the Amarrians claimed
    a victory, but the Minmatars had succeeded in disabling or destroying the best
    capital ships in the Amarr fleet, thus reducing their offensive strength dramatically.
    Today the old battlefield, commonly known as Golgothan Fields, is littered with
    old shipwrecks and infested with pirates that have taken refuge in the giant hulks.
    They fiercely defend their base, but daring scavengers can still sneak in and
    rummage around. \n\n  * _Entered Via_ : N/A \n  * _CONCORD / DED Rating_ : N/A
    \n\n\n* * *\n\n__Ginnungagap__\n\n  * Ginnungagap is a huge black hole at the
    edge of Minmatar space. It is the largest black hole close to civilized space.
    The black hole has already rendered several solar systems close to it uninhabitable,
    but otherwise it is not considered to pose any great risk to inhabited space for
    the foreseeable future. The black hole can be seen very clearly in the Konora
    system, located very close to it. \n\n  * _Entered Via_ : N/A \n  * _CONCORD /
    DED Rating_ : N/A \n\n\n* * *\n\n__Point Of No Return__\n\n  * Point of no Return
    is a small black hole located not far from empire space. The black hole is rather
    old and was formed by a sun only just large enough to create a black hole when
    it collapsed. One interesting fact about it is that it\u2019s located more or
    less exactly in the center of the known world, if you only count those systems
    that have been linked with star gates. \n\n  * _Entered Via_ : N/A \n  * _CONCORD
    / DED Rating_ : N/A \n\n\n* * *\n\nAs we head back to Polaris our next installment
    will reflect on what we have seen and we will have advice for those wanting to
    experience the life of an explorer and adventurer. \n\n* * *"
