    Implants Discovered In Serpentis shipyard and research sites\n\nOn June 29th,
    YC115, capsuleers across the cluster began to invade Serpentis sites in the hope
    of rich rewards [spurred on by The Scope news reporting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0LhyK5Kc_0)
    and lucrative rewards offered. The capsuleer [Tom Ocilithon](https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Tom%20Ocilithon)
    was one of the first to get his hands on a Mid-Grade Asklepian Epsilon, one of
    several implants that were rumored to be held within the sites. \n\nWhen asked
    about the circumstances around the acquisition he replied \"I'd just like to say
    that I feel real lucky that one dropped so soon (after entering the site), and
    that their stats look awesome... I hope everyone tries their hand at getting them.
    It was relatively easy in an Ishtar, although it was a bit challenging with drones
    taking aggression\".\n\nSince then capsuleers have been able to loot further such
    implants and started selling them with nice profits in the major trade hubs of
    New Eden.\n\n**Additional information:**\n\n[Shadow of the Serpent](https://www.eveonline.com/events/shadow-of-the-serpent/)
