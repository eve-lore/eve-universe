- body: "![](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/assets/icarticlebanner.png)  \n  \nThe second
    round of Group stages completed this past weekend. One more round of Stages and
    the Finals are scheduled for this coming weekend.  \n  \nMinmatar ships dominate
    this tournament with 517 of varied classes being fielded so far. Caldari ships
    are a distant second with 318 being fielded, but 105 of those alone were Tengus.
    The Cyclone (90), Sabre (88), Scimitar (85) and Sleipnir (83) still fill out the
    Top 5 slots along with the 105 Tengus.  \n  \nTwo Flagships were fielded, with
    one lost and one surviving a win. HYDRA RELOADED's Bhaalgorn was valued at over
    30 billion ISK and helped them achieve a flawless victory over Ushra'Khan. It
    is believed that Perihelion's Bhaalgorn lacked officer modules, so their loss
    against Paisti Syndicate is not expected to have a major impact on alliance funds.
    \ \n  \nAll eyes will be on Match 7 this weekend when Tournament VIII champions
    Pandemic Legion face off against Tournament VIII second place winner HYDRA RELOADED
    in their group match. Both teams meet undefeated in their previous matches and
    carry full points.  \n  \nMatch reports and statistics are available on the Interstellar
    Correspondents' website.  \n  \nCome visit us at:\n\n## <http://at.eve-ic.net/>\n\n*
