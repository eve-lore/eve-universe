- body: "The rumours of gladiatorial raiding parties attacking Amarrian Vitoc convoys
    were confirmed late last night, as a convoy led by Edooba Ashwan was ambushed
    in the Rasile system.   \n  \nOne Bestower, belonging to the Amarr Trade Registry,
    was destroyed in the conflict and many slaves onboard were taken by the seemingly
    rogue gladiators. The Impel carrying the Vitoc shipment escaped relatively unscathed,
    and Ashwan commended the pod pilots who helped to fight off the gladiators, mentioning
    Garreck, Pulgor, Ceratin and Argentarius especially.   \n  \nBoth sides of the
    conflict took some losses, but the combined force of the CVA and Aegis Militia
    pilots held the gladiators at bay, allowing the convoy to escape. Commenting on
    the whole affair, Edooba Ashwan had the following to say: \"These gladiators are
    highly skilled pilots, and showed the utmost respect to myself and the other Amarrians
    present. When speaking about the nature of the attack, they simply stated that
    it had to be done. It's all very confusing.\"   \n  \nSpeculation is high that
    these attacks may be linked to the murders of two prominent slaveholders, Rezini
    Lifu and Bamadak Pareh. It is, however, not yet supported by any conclusive evidence."
