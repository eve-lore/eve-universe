    \ by ISD Tedra Kerrigan\n\n**Etherium Reach, New Eden.**   Early this month, members
    of the N3 Coalition alliance woke up one morning to discover that they had lost
    sovereignty in more than 200 systems in Etherium Reach, Detorid, Omist, Immensea
    and other regions.\n\nAccording to sources, a spy disbanded the alliance holding
    a large chunk of the coalition's sovereignty, kicking out all its corporations
    and dropping sovereignty in more than 200 systems. He allegedly also made off
    with 400 Billion ISK. In addition, the 33 stations directly owned by the hijacked
    holding corporation were immediately locked down, stranding hundreds of capsuleers
    in hostile nullsec space. The more than 120 corporations which had been members
    of the now-defunct alliance were also stranded, unable to join new alliances due
    to active wardecs.\n\nAccording to Nulli Secunda member Gorga, the actions were
    taken by Nicholai Sanse, but he added that it appeared that Sanse was under the
    control of someone else at the time.\n\nWith other groups and coalitions turning
    eager eyes on the South, the N3 Coalition rallied a fleet of over two hundred
    supercapital ships and ran operations over four days, initially retaking 156 of
    the 200+ lost systems. According to Gorga a number of systems were taken by renters
    during this process, but he was confident that those systems would shortly be
    under N3 control once more.\n\n###  GalNet References\n\n[Sovereignty loss overview
