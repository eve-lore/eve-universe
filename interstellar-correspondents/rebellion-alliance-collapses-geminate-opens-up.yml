    \\- Rebellion Alliance collapsed as it lost all of its sovereignty in Geminate
    over the weekend. Rumors abound, but the cause of the collapse is not known for
    certain.  \n  \n[![Pilots preparing for battle](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4397/imagethumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4397/image.png)Several
    systems in Geminate were fought over viciously in an impressive string of battles,
    some of which had over 900 capsuleers in system and saw numerous titans and supercarriers
    fielded. The battles come as no surprise to people familiar with the region: Geminate
    has been a hotbed of conflict in recent years.  \n  \nIt may take days to analyze
    the results of the seemingly chaotic system and station grabs that occurred in
    these running battles.  \n  \nAs for Rebellion Alliance, many believe that the
    alliance was taken out from the inside. One very strong indicator that supports
    this rumor is that sovereignty was not lost system by system, but rather throughout
    all of Rebellion Alliance space. Coupled with a drastic drop in membership, evidence
    seems to point to an unplanned disbanding.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Geminate
