    **Deltole, Sinq Laison** \\- Cold Fusion Syndicate [CFS] has officially disbanded
    after more than 3 years as a successful high security industrial alliance.   \n
    \ \nFormer Vice President of CFS, Aelana Anais, said a major factor in the decision
    to disband was that the tech 1 ship market in the region is \"a mess right now\"
    and it had become \"increasingly difficult to fund and maintain the alliance\"
    as they had relied heavily on their tech 1 ship building business  \n  \nShe also
    suggested that corporations and alliances living in high security space will always
    have a problem with \"griefer corporations\" moving into their regions. She felt
    this also contributed to CFS disbanding as there was a \"marked increase of griefer
    activity and wardec corps\" in the Sinq Laison region.   \n  \nThe decision to
    disband, Aelana revealed, was made more difficult by the \"very tight community\"
    they had established within the alliance. The community was also the reason that
    Aelana gave as CFS lasting so long, claiming that former members have stayed in
    touch despite parting ways.   \n  \nThe community seems to have created a lasting
    memory among the former members, with former senior member of management in CFS,
    Vaerla Myshtana exclaiming: \"In the darkness of Hulkageddon... my heart beats
    strongly knowing that out there dwell the Sons of Eethrak and I long for the day
    when they may rise up in a Great Carebear Crusade against those who perversely
    lust for misery.\"   \n  \nAelana's words suggest that other industrial corporations
    and alliances could be at risk as more aggressive corporations and alliances spread
    across New Eden. As a final word, she had this to say to the former capsuleers
    of CFS: \"Fly safe, or however you want to fly, and keep in touch.\"\n\n### GalNet
