- body: "The ERE took a serious blow today, suffering the loss of a portion of their
    latest aid shipment at the hands of Johnny W, a Gallente pod-pilot.   \n  \nThe
    humanitarian organisation have been lending a hand to the poor, underprivileged
    and less fortunate of the galaxy for some time now and this is the first time
    they've been taken advantage of in such a way.   \n  \nThe theft took place yesterday
    evening, during the ERE's latest convoy run. Eleven pod pilots were recruited
    from the local channel in Algogille, with a final destination somewhere in the
    Bei system. Unfortunately, Johnny W fled with his portion of the goods, most likely
    to sell them to the highest bidder.   \n  \nKarl Newton, CEO of the ERE was shocked
    by the betrayal, \"I find it hard to believe that a fellow Gallente could be so
    unscrupulous. Today, for the first time, I am ashamed of my heritage.\""
