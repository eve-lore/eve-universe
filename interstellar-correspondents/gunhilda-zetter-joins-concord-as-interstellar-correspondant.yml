- body: "The Sebaeu Foundation, a voluntarily funded organisation set up to promote
    the free exchange of unbiased news throughout Amarr space, has finally announced
    that Gunhilda Zetter, Chief Correspondent for the Kor-Azor Regional Bureau, is
    now working for CONCORD with the newly set-up Interstellar News Administration.
    It appears she left the Foundation well over a week ago, the official announcement
    apparently delayed in respect of the death of Emperor Heideran VII.   \n  \nZetter
    rose to prominence after her imprisonment in the wake of the Chaven suicide attacks
    five years ago when it was discovered that the Minmatar terrorist leader who led
    the fatal attack on Convoy CS-237 was interviewed by her just days before. Charged
    with heresy and treason, there was insufficient evidence to imprison her and she
    was forced into self-imposed exile for over three years until she was pardoned
    by the Amarr authorities.   \n  \nA registered narcoleptic, Zetter was unavailable
    for comment. CONCORD have however made assurances that she can be reached via
    all the official IC channels of communication by those wishing to submit news
    requests. Sebaeu have since made public that they will not be advertising for
    applicants to fill the vacancy."
