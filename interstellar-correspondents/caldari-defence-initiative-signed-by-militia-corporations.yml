    corporations have signed the \"Caldari Defence Initiative\" [CDI], a mutual assistance
    pact which aims to create a unified, organized core to the Caldari militia and
    extend support from its signatory members to other State Protectorate corporations.
    \ \n  \nSignatories to the treaty at present are Inglorious-Basterds, Payable
    on Death, Pillow Fighters Inc, Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Obvious Indecision,
    Spacetime Enterprises, Costolle Military Asistance Corporation, Multistar Protectorate
    Militia, The Lost Legion, The Rapalas and Dark-Force.   \n  \nRamingo, CEO of
    Payable on Death, claims the idea for the treaty arose when several militia corporations
    came together to assist fellow State Protectorate corporation Inglorious-Basterds.
    The CDI uses the standard principles of a mutual assistance pact - non-aggression
    between signatories and collective defence of all members, but it also covers
    a corporation for only as long as they remain affiliated (officially or unofficially)
    with the State Protectorate and decrees absolutely that the signatory corporations
    remain independent - they are not bound to follow a single leader.   \n  \nEarlier
    this year, a heavy push from the Federal Defence Union saw the Gallente Federation
    reclaim sovereignty of most of its systems in the war zone. At roughly the same
    time, a number of prominent State Protectorate corporations resigned from the
    militia or dropped into inactivity. Ramingo commented: \"Until about a month ago
    the [Caldari] militia was a laughing stock, getting slaughtered daily because
    we had zero co-ordination.\"   \n  \nAnother factor cited by some Caldari militia
    pilots in their decline was the departure of popular fleet commander GavinGoodrich
    for 0.0 space, taking with him many experienced State Protectorate pilots. Hidden
    Snake, CEO of Inglorious-Basterds, said that GavinGoodrich's departure set the
    militia back to a primitive, discordant condition.   \n  \nGavinGoodrich himself
    felt the CDI is \"a workable concept, as long as all those corporations are on
    the same page... If I ever came back, I would join the CDI in some shape or form.\"
    \  \n  \nRamingo was also interested in attracting new pilots to organized elements
    in the militia. \"Mostly I would just like to let them know that the militia offers
    hassle-free action within a few jumps, ISK earning activities paying 100 million
    an hour, and you don't have the usual nonsense you have with 0.0 alliances.\"
    \  \n  \nWith 11 corporations signed up to the Caldari Defence Initiative, the
    Caldari State Protectorate now has its own parallel to the [Federal Defence Union's](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Federate_Defence_Union)

    whose corporations formed part of this year's push to reclaim Gallente territory
    occupied by the Caldari State.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Caldari Defence Initiative
