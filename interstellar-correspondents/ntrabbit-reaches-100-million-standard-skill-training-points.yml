    Hand Social Club announced that he had reached 100,000,000 skill points.\n\n[![NTRabbit](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2686/ntrabbitthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F2686%2Fntrabbit.png)Skill
    Points are a standardised measure used by the Society of Conscious Thought for
    the amount of training a pilot has received across all fields in the Capsuleer
    Standard Educational Set.\n\n#### The Life and Times of a Man of Flexible Morality\n\nNTRabbit
    graduated from Caldari Constructions in late YC 104 to take a place as leader
    of Military Operations in Medusa constellation for Xanadu corporation. He was
    there for some 4 months, during which he experimented with many aspects of a capsuleer's
    life and work.\n\n\"For weeks I cruised around the Medusa Constellation in a shiny
    bantam, using a [secret agent] to spy on my own troops, and generally cause mayhem.
    I still wonder if I caused that poor pilot to quit, not realizing at the time
    that a rather nasty bug meant that any pod-killed pilots were corrupted [and could
    not reclone].\n\n\"I flew my pulse laser armed Ibis all the way down to Aridia
    (quite a journey in those days). Discorporation and I made an ill-fated attempt
    to find the Double Hydra Implants - a fictional implant which [allegedly] allowed
    two skills to be trained simultaneously. Instead, I found myself fighting random
    people in the middle of nowhere, saving bounty money for upgrades.\n\n\"I once
    used my 'neutrality' to smuggle an SPVD blackbird past an Evolution blockade on
    one side of a gate, only to almost be destroyed by the SPVD blockade on the other,
    finding out as I traded the ship back to its owner - my friend, Chantalaz - that
    I had just flown through a pair of blockades manned by the best combat pilots...
    with a clone 2 million skill points out of date. I never made that mistake again.\"\n\n\"Instead
    of mining, and against the express wishes of Xanadu, I elected to do agent missions,
    long before any serious rewards existed. Suddenly, three months later, the very
    first implants [became openly available], and what a surprise, they were agent
    rewards. I quickly earned myself a full set, then went about making a small fortune
    selling the others. My corp went from threatening to fire me for wasting time,
    to demanding their share of my profits. After refusing to turn over money they
    had demanded I never earn in the first place - and purchasing my first battleship,
    a Raven - Xanadu elected to dismiss me for insubordination.\"\n\nNTRabbit then
    spent three months working alone, registered first to Caldari Provisions, then
    to his own corporation, Black Harridan, which has remained closed since his departure.\n\nIn
    early 108. he joined Jericho Fraction. While he confesses a fondness for the conversations
    he had with some of the members and what he describes as \"epic battles\" against
    Mercenary Frigates in some of the first interceptors to see general production,
    he was uncomfortable with \"some of the shadier elements of Jericho\" and resigned
    from his position after encountering two members of the corp _in flagrante delicto_.\n\n\"Thus
    began my self-imposed exile from the community. For almost two years I played
    alone, in a series of humorously named one man corps, often talking to my drones
    and insinuating to the outside world they all sat on the board. I cared little
    for the \"great alliances\" and their ridiculous wars. Venal, Stain, Curse, Fountain,
    all came and went, with little to show for it.\"\n\n\"After these years of solitude
    and missions... I was approached by a mercenary. Istvaan Shogaatsu offered me
    a position; I took it.\n\n\"The Guiding Hand Social Club provided me with opportunities
    for destruction on a grand scale. I participated in many 'ventures.' Theft, murder,
    more simple mercenary work, but always with a grand objective and an even grander
    tale at the end.\n\n\"Eventually Tyrrax Thorrk realised the utility of my skillset
    in the tournament; since then, I have participated in all, with mixed results.\"
    Having previously flown for IAC before the Guilding Hand Social Club \"removed\"
    a wyvern mothership from their possession, NTRabbit will also be participating
    in the forthcoming Alliance Tournament VI as team captain for the Otherworld Empire
    Productions team.\n\n#### Making the Most of Skill Training  \n\n\nNTRabbit is
    currently [listed as one of the top ten pilots](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fineve.net%2Fskills%2Fgrouplist.php%3Fskillgroupid%3D1),
    based on skill points accrued, though this can mislead as there are many who do
    not use the ranking service. So how did he get there?\n\nHe says \"Acquiring basic
    implants early, and then upgrading to standard and subsequently improved as quickly
    as possible certainly aided in achieving my high skill points, as did careful
    planning and a good memory, to ensure I lost as little dead time between skills
    as possible.\"\n\nWith his current +5 implants, NTRabbit manages to train an average
    of 2257.2 skill points per hour. But what use are they out there in space?\n\n\"A
    great focus on diversity and flexibility over specialization has given me the
    edge in many real-world scenarios, where flying a ship more suited to the task
    at hand is preferrable.\" Or, as IAC learned from NTRabbit, being able to fly
    off with the ship _at_ hand is also quite useful...\n\n\"Minmatar Battleship 5
    is up next to finish off the set, followed by some rounding off of my recently
    acquired capital skills.\"\n\n\"[But this] is a social universe, and not everything
    can be solved with skill points. Experience has taught me that any connections
    made in the past may become a valuable asset in the future.\"\n\nWhether you love
    him or hate him, one thing is certain - with this knowledge at his disposal, NTRabbit
    and others like him can turn their hand to nearly anything they might desire,
    on the whim of a moment...\n\nOr make off with it.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[NTRabbit
