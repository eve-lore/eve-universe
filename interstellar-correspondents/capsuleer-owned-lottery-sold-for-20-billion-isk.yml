    seeing T'Amber go, since I've always been a big fan (and supporter) of the SoE
    events. Hopefully I can put the name to good use in the future, and that this
    ISK will be useful to the shareholders during this closeout.\"  \n  \nShips of
    Eve was officially sold to Selene D'Celeste on October 24, only two days after
    the initial sale was advertised.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in
