    corporation but gave it back on a second thought, explaining that he didn't wish
    the young pilots of Sniggwaffe to be helpless due to his actions.   \n  \nSaint
    Schala sold the fruits of his heist back to Sniggerdly for approximately 42 billion
    ISK, 8 billion ISK less than their real value.\u200B \"A trusted friend in PL
    acted as a middle man for negotiations,\" he explained.   \n  \nWith the 42 billion
    ISK proceeds from his successful heist against Pandemic Legion to sustain him,
    Saint Schala said he now plans to move to low security systems for a while and
    might join a corporation where other thieves have regrouped. He stated \"I wouldnt
    expect anyone to give me access to large assets now, it doesn't bother me.\"\n\n*
