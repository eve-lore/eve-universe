    to infidel mining operations.\"[![NER Headquarters](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3384/hqthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3384/hq.png)
    \ \n  \nA JihadSwarm \"mujahedeen\" (warrior of faith) claims they have already
    stolen three control towers as they were unanchored in addition to starbase siege
    operations currently in progress.  \n  \nNER representative Tamia Clant confirmed
    that war was indeed declared by GoonSwarm on Friday and a ransom note was delivered
    demanding one-hundred million ISK per starbase up to three hundred million ISK
    maximum or three billion ISK if starbase sieges were already underway. Clant estimates
    that NER holdings consisted of twenty to thirty starbases prior to the war.  \n
    \ \nThe note was allegedly delivered via an alliance-wide message sent by a JihadSwarm
    agent representing \"Grand Sheikh karttoon\" who declared \"jihad\" against NER
    for providing research to \"infidels\" being used to \"manufacture vessels used
    to defile our holy belts.\"  \n  \n\"\u2026every [control tower] anchored in space
    will be promptly attacked and destroyed in order to serve the great one in his
    quest to protect our holy land,\" says karttoon.  \n  \nThe ransom note was refused
    based on GoonSwarm's reputation.  \n  \n\"GoonSwarm isn't particularly known for
    being an honest entity, and we had no guarantees they wouldn't keep sieging towers
    even after the ransom was paid,\" says Clant. \"The most financially wise choice
    was really to just remove all assets and refund customers.\"  \n  \nIn regards
    to refunds outside of Clant's own corporation, New Dawn Corp [NDC], Clant stated
    that they would be handled according to each corporation's own discretion.  \n
    \ \nThe alliance itself has already begun to feel the effects of the war with
    its membership plummeting by around twenty corps and two hundred members over
    the last couple days. \"NER couldn't possibly have the military infrastructure
    to face\u2026 a dedicated combat corp,\" Clant says, \"let alone an alliance on
    the level of GoonSwarm. With that in mind, it's only natural corps choose to leave.\"
    \ \n  \nThis is not the first time JihadSwarm has engaged in terrorism within
    empire space. Many remember when the organization [targeted empire miners](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=1810&tid=7)
    early last year on a mix of socio-economic and spiritual grounds never fully explained
    [until today](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1175700).
    [Penance was offered](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=1881&tid=7)
    in the form of one hundred million ISK donations leading many to question the
    groups motives. Later in the year, the group [desecrated the final resting place](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=2348&tid=7)
    of over seven-hundred capsuleers on religious grounds.   \n  \nIn regards to the
    future of NER, Clant says, \"that is yet to be decided.\"\n\n* * *\n\nAre you
