- body: "Several days ago, high-ranking Ascendant Frontier members were notified of
    an imminent split in their alliance as the Dirty Deeds Corporation, along with
    Eye of God, planned to start a new alliance that would claim the Impass region.
    An anonymous source with access to this information has put forth a summary, partly
    confirmed in a conversation with Steel Rat, ASCN Director. \n\nDirty Deeds Corp
    and Eye of God plan to present the inhabitants of Impass with two options: joining
    the new alliance or staying in Ascendant Frontier. According to the source, both
    alliances will remain friendly towards each other after the separation, retaining
    full access to each other's space and stations. Ascendant Frontier members who
    wish to operate in Impass are allowed to do this without joining the new alliance
    because of the positive standing between the two alliances.\n\nAscendant Frontier
    intends to invite more alliances into an agreement where members will protect
    each other from invasion. Among the possible candidates are the alliances KOS
    and Tribal Souls. At the same time, Ascendant Frontier will also seek to expand
    their membership after the departure of Dirty Deeds and Eye of God is finalised.
    The negotiations with these corporations started some time ago.\n\nAccording to
    sources, several high-ranking members of the Ascendant Frontier believe that the
    split will make both alliances weaker and that the friendship won\u2019t last.
    \n\n\u201CThe enemies of ASCN will perceive this as a weakness, a crack in the
    structure,\" stated an ASCN director who wished to remain anonymous. \"I think
    ... we're putting blood in the water, as it were, and we're going to feel it down
    the road.\"\n\n\"CYVOK and Steel Rat balanced each other out. The first was being
    too optimistic, the last just wants to kill anything that moves. Most of the industrial
    corporations that have powered ASCN are going to stay with Cyvok and DDC is going
    to lose a lot of that base. I think ... they're going to find out just how hard
    it is to sustain a huge empire like this without your industry being up to part.\"\n\nSteel
    Rat, CEO of DDC, is positive that the two alliances will be able to work closely
    together without any problems and that people who expect ASCN and the DDC alliance
    to be weak will be surprised. \n\nHe stated: \u201CI guess I should make it clear
    here, this change is not a hostile change. Cyvok and I both agree that we can
    work better together as separate entities than as one. It allows us both to grow
    and create what we feel is best for our alliances. We have our plans and goals
    still firmly in place. In many ways, we see this change as reaching those goals
    faster and now neither one is slowed down by the other.\u201D \n\nThe new alliance
    is expected to be formally created before long."
