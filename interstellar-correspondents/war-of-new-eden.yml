- body: "NEW EDEN - The southern regions of New Eden have become engulfed in an epic
    war that has seen former enemies come together against a common foe, the Band
    of Brothers (BoB) and Lotka Volterra (LV). The war threatens to upset the balance
    of power in the galaxy, and has so far seen some staggering losses on both sides.
    BoB has long since declared that dominating all non-secure space has been their
    long- term goal, and no alliance has yet been able to stop their advances. Only
    now has a Coalition emerged to attempt to halt them in their tracks. The question
    remains; can they succeed where others have failed? \n\nAt times referred to as
    the \u201CGreat South War\u201D, the conflict has pitted a majority of alliances
    against a numerically inferior but in the main, more experienced foe. This war
    is no different from the ones that rage daily in our homes and far-flung systems
    alike; except that the manner of which it is being fought is reminiscent of the
    old Corporation Wars that lurk in the shadows of history. \n\nThe pod pilot community
    has long become accustomed to the rise and fall of entities, be they corporations
    that have written themselves into history with their actions or alliances with
    the power to be that story. With the four Empires involved in their own perpetual
    struggles and unwilling, or even perhaps unable to stop the onslaught, it has
    fallen upon the capsuleer pilots to self-govern. The growing concern amongst those
    few remaining independent alliances and the lingering discontent displayed by
    those displaced by BoB\u2019s to date, rarely impeded advances have culminated
    finally, in all out war. \n\nTo fully understand the complex political situation,
    we shall be offering an in-depth analysis of the conflict from a variety of perspectives.
    Covering the war from the view of the pod pilots fighting, report on why they
    chose to be at war, and why they chose the side they are on. \n\nThe current Coalition
    consists of: \n\n        * Red Alliance - RA\n\n        * Against ALL Authorities
    - -A-\n\n        * GoonSwarm - OHGOD / GS\n\n        * Tau Ceti Federation - TCF\n\n
    \       * Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate - IAC\n\n        * Curse Alliance
    - CA\n\n        * Dusk and Dawn - D\xB2\n\n        * RAZOR Alliance - RZR\n\n
    \       * Imperial Republic Of the North - IRON\n\n        * Morsus Mihi - RAWR
    / MM\n\n        * Knights Of the Southerncross - KOS\n\n        * SMASH Alliance
    - SMASH\n\n        * Triumvirate. - TR\n\n        * Sparta Alliance - -SPR- \n\n
    \       * Pandemic Legion - -10\n\n  \n  \nwith the BOB Allied forces including:
    \n\n        * Band of Brothers - BOB\n\n        * Lotka Volterra - LV\n\n        *
    Firmus Ixion - FIX\n\n        * Xelas Alliance - XS\n\n        * R i s e - RISE\n\n
    \       * Corelum Syndicate - CORELI\n\n        * Axiom Empire - AXE\n\n        *
    Exuro Mortis - OSNAP\n\n        * Aftermath Alliance - PANIC \n\n        * Mercenary
    Coalition \u2013 MC (contracted by BOB)\n\n  \nFighting has still been very intense
    on both sides, with major losses of both territory and ships. Of significance
    is: \n\n_Southern Front Battlefield Theatre \u2013 Querious_\n\nCoalition forces
    have attacked multiple systems in Querious, with 9CG6-H being the focal point
    of their offensive. At this time no stations have changed hands, despite almost
    daily losses of starbases around the region. Both sides have devoted much of their
    resources to the defence of their own starbases, understanding their tactical
    importance as both regroup points for fleets and safe havens for capitals, essential
    for a foothold in the region. \n\nFIX are believed to have hired KIA alliance
    (exact figures are unknown, but unconfirmed sources have put the mercenary alliance\u2019s
    bill at 5.7 billion isk for their services) to attempt to sever the Coalition
    forces supply routes to Querious. \n\nED-L9T \n\nSo far a BoB/FIX capital fleet
    has engaged and destroyed 6 RZR/MM/IRON Dreadnoughts for the loss of one large
    tower and three more placed into reinforced mode. \n\n_Eastern Front Battlefield
    Theatre \u2013 Detorid, Wicked Creek, Tenerifis, and Omist_\n\nCoalition forces
    destroyed a Lotka Volterra capital shipyard. Widespread rumours alleged that a
    Titan class ship under construction was destroyed \u2013 the numbers of those
    involved reaching staggering proportions lends credence to the assertions. Red
    Alliance reinforcements ultimately prevailed on the field and the loss of the
    Allied shipyards seems to have dampened LV's will to fight and set off a negative
    chain reaction that now has the predators of Eve likely hunting for a new home.
    \n\nN3-JBX/KZFV-4 \n\nAn LV and BoB fleet moved to assault KZFV-4 and was repelled
    by a larger IAC fleet. IAC/GS held the field in KZFV-4. \n\nC3-0YD \n\nAn LV and
    ISS capital fleet destroyed an IAC Nyx-class Mothership. \n\n_Western Front Battlefield
    Theatre \u2013 Fountain_\n\nInitially Coalition forces captured the outpost system
    of 7BX-6F in northern Fountain and were met with spirited but ultimately ineffective
    resistance. Their attempts to push forward were held back when Allied forces arrived,
    who then retook the 7BX-6F station. \n\nThe loss of the station was compounded
    by the destruction of a Coalition Titan from D2. In a spectacular display of the
    value of subterfuge, a spy prevented the super-capital ship from safely leaving
    space and, having been probed out; a BoB fleet engaged and destroyed the behemoth,
    the second ship of its class to fall prey to them. Although Coalition forces have
    suffered some heavy losses and setbacks, their resolve remains unbroken and the
    appearance of a second Titan recently has shown a willingness to continue their
    campaign despite the heaviest of losses. \n\nAllied forces in the area are currently
    holding the tide of Coalition forces back with the help of the second Allied Titan
    of the BoB fleet. \n\n  \nDespite the significant losses of both ships and territory
    in these opening stages of the war, many agree that a final conclusion is both
    difficult to ascertain and a long way off. The almost unprecedented resolve of
    both sides in this war to come out as victors lends weight to the frequent claims
    that this will be a epic, protracted war of attrition that will see many more
    losses, and test the fortitude of all involved parties."
