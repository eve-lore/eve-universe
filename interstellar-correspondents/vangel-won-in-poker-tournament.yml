    **Jita, The Forge** \\- The Vangel Tournament at EOH Poker concluded on 07.08.113
    with winner Maurospanthiras receiving an Amarrian Vangel cruiser valued at approximately
    30 Billion ISK.   \n  \nThe [Vangel](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Vangel)
    is a limited edition cruiser produced exclusively as a prize for Alliance Tournament
    IX. While such rarities are seldom fielded in combat, the Vangel is described
    by one combat pilot, Shiroi Okami, as combining \"the strengths of a Sacrilege
    and a Curse with the weaknesses of neither.\"   \n  \nRunner-up Askgar Elzoop
    received a 12 month Pilot's Licence Extension (PLEX). The third place winner received
    6 months in PLEX, while 4th place was awarded a Blood Raider Bhaalgorn battleship.
    \  \n  \nTournament organizer Selene D\u2019Celeste said that the event had gone
    smoothly and was very successful. EOH Poker currently holds over 9,000 capsuleer
    accounts and has tracked over 105 trillion ISK in wagers since its conception
    in year 109.   \n  \nMaurospanthiras said he was excited for a chance to win a
    legendary ship. Having won it, he said he plans to keep the Vangel rather than
    sell it on for the 30 Billion ISK pricetag, but laughingly said \u201CI can\u2019t
    fly Amarr for the life of me.\u201D   \n  \nRunner-up Askgar Ezloop said he only
    signed up with EOH a week before the tournament began and so was amazed to discover
    that he had received a seat in the match. \"I\u2019ve never seen more than 1 billion
    ISK... so to suddenly have 12 PLEX, it\u2019ll change my... life.\u201D   \n  \nEOH
    Poker has concluded a special 30-seat tournament to celebrate 30,000 registrations,
    awarding a 30 Billion ISK Vangel cruiser to the winner, Maurosanthiras, along
    with Pilot's Licence Extensions and Blood Raider ships for the remaining competitors.\n\n###
