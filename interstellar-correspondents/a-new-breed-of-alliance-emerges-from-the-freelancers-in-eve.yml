- body: "Yesterday the Genesis region, home of CONCORD and the widely accepted centre
    of civilised space, played host to events far from usual, even for this heavily
    trafficked region of space. Converging from all over the known universe, ships
    flocked to the CONCORD Assembly station to celebrate the formation of a new alliance.
    An alliance which, according to its founders will allow pilots to \u201Cchoose
    their own destiny\u201D, as was announced by senior alliance officials. This alliance
    calls itsself the FLA, or the \u201CFreelancer Alliance\u201D.   \n  \nAfter a
    short celebratory party involving the distribution of a large selection of food,
    drinks and other consumables as well as a firework display outside the station
    perimeter, the FLA fleet, comprising of ships ranging from industrial to Battleship
    class vessels set course for Sheroo, where the main celebrations were to take
    place. These celebrations involved a frigate tournament, several impromptu duels
    between corporation members and a raffle for a brand new battleship, won by one
    Jon Catterall. Clearly the festivities displayed demonstrate the ideals upon which
    the alliance is based are tangible; these being that of freedom, kinship and the
    ability to co-exist whilst having different viewpoints on any of a myriad of different
    subjects.   \n  \nSpeaking with senior alliance officials Jack Soul and Anjelle,
    a picture was painted of a group of pilots each with their own goals, joined together
    in a fellowship to help each other achieve success in the EVE universe. A safe,
    secure place in which new and old pilots can co-exist peacefully without pressure
    to do anything they don\u2019t wish to. This alliance will also not have any political
    ambitions, it was even stated that unless there are exceptional circumstances
    where the entire alliance thinks with one mind they will remain as neutral as
    possible. The first of these \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 has already
    come to light, this being the controversial issue of piracy, as stated by Jack
    Soul, \"We would like our members to try to be mature, and remember that their
    action reflect on the rest of us, so we tend to prefer members who will not actively
    be \u2018less than savoury\u2019\".   \n  \nGuidelines like these however pose
    a serious question when it comes to freedom: How can a pilot be truly free when
    they are still expected to subscribe to rules which may or may not reflect their
    own personal opinions? In response to this Anjelle released the statement: \"This
    is the one and only part of FLA which involves regulations - we do not approve
    of the grief that is inflicted over honest pilots by the pirate elements of our
    society. We also include other guidelines such as keeping a degree of respect
    between one another; however these should all be considered common sense. In sacrificing
    these small \u2018freedoms\u2019 you actually amplify the overall freedom for
    the entire group\". They went on to publicly thank several individuals who had
    worked hard in the run up to the alliance consolidation. \"I would also like to
    thank, Ariana Fiedala, PowerGel, Sir Juju and all the other people who have worked
    hard for this alliance to get started\".   \n  \nClearly this is a very ambitious
    and idealist concept, however whether this alliance will meet with little success
    due to its nature of a completely free community, or alternatively becoming a
    powerful coalition of pilots for the exact same reason remains to be seen."
