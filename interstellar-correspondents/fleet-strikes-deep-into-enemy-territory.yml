- body: "**Choonka** \u2013 A fleet, on a mission from God, set out from Choonka with
    spirits high. Striking deep into enemy space, they secured several key positions
    while leaving the local forces running in circles.\n\n**Darth A3ONZ** led the
    crusade backed up by his Wing Commander **Rogue Seven**. The small fleet consisted
    of frigate class vessels and some support vessels.\n\nAt one time, the fleet was
    forced to fall back from Ardar due to a large enemy fleet jumping into the system.
    Several of our brothers and sisters were lost before we were able to regroup.
    Once we regrouped, we began our crusade to bring the teachings of our Lord God
    to the heathens.\n\nWe engaged at Floseswin and we were victorious while capturing
    a military compound. From there we moved on to Vimeini securing a stronghold and
    another military compound. After several jumps, avoiding a large enemy force,
    we ended up in Avenod.\n\nOur scouts uncovered yet another stronghold and we promptly
    began to secure it in the name of God. During the last few minutes of battle a
    medium sized heathen fleet jumped in and attempted to stop us. **Scagga Laebetrovo**
    , **pyraX Sg** and **Thiesland** stayed behind and managed to hold off the enemy
    until the stronghold was secured.\n\nOur journey continued through Todifrauan
    and Arnstur, and then on to Helgatild and Klogori, securing several more key positions.
    Having brought the greatness of God and spreading it through the heathen\u2019s
    space our crusade came to an end.\n\nAfter returning to Choonka some of the fleet
    retired to meditate on recent events. Others set out upon another journey deep
    into enemy space.\n\nWe leave you with these thoughts from fellow pilots.\n\n**Dracus
    Algor** , _\u2018The key to winning this war... is to fight the war on our terms
    and not theirs.\u2019_\n\n**TheOnlyProphet** , _\u2018We are their angels. We
    must be their saviors. By your power they shall be rescued from the dark. God
    wills it, and so it shall be.\u2019_"
