    to ship logs, the freighter was controlled by Shmak DatAsh, leader of Consortium.
    Sylem, diplomat for Advocated Destruction, confirmed the vessel was defended only
    by a small support fleet.  \n  \n\"We were in a small gang [when] we just happened
    to see the freighter warp to a gate. We then gave chase [and] finally one of our
    pilots caught it in [Pynekastoh],\" he said.  \n  \nSuch a loss could not go unnoticed
    among members of Consortium. Alliance: \"The loss caused a major fissure... some
    people wanted heads to roll, others wanted to pick up and build another [station
    platform],\" said Shmak DatAsh.  \n  \nThe loss sparked an attempted coup by fellow
    alliance leader R0ck Muncher. The coup failed and R0ck Muncher left the alliance,
    taking four corporations with him.  \n  \nAen Gentarus, who recently left the
    alliance, explains: \"we had worked pretty hard, as had the alliance as a whole
    to get the resources for the platform... so when that [egg] was lost, it was a
    devastating blow.\"  \n  \nThe psychological blow and the subsequent political
    turmoil have caused Consortium.'s member count to drop from over one thousand
    to less than 600 capsuleers. However, Consortium.'s leader believes it is only
    a matter of time before the alliance recovers its full strength.  \n  \n\"Once
    we get back [on our feet], we'll be back on the drawingboard working closer with
    Atlas,\" Shmak DatAsh stated.  \n  \n[Picture](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3751/shmakdatash.png)\n\n*
