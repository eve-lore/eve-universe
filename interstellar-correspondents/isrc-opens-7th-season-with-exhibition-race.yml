    (ISRC) kicked off Season 7 with an exhibition event teaming veteran racers with
    rookies.\n\nAs an exhibition event, racers did not race with their regular teams
    and were restricted to tech 1 frigate class vessels. The organiser for this race
    **_Catherine 'Quintrala' Delorois_** , had the final decision on whether a racer
    was considered a rookie or veteran.\n\n[![Racer navigates ice field](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2802/imagethumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F2802%2Fimage.png)\n\nOnce
    the teams had been sorted, the race began at the Aliastra Retail Center Station
    in Hek, continuing through 13 different systems including several non-Concord
    policed systems.\n\nThe racers were doing well and managing to evade the lawless
    elements of most systems with either little or no damage until the rookie pilot
    **_Kira Storm_** lost her Condor at the 9th waypoint (she eventually retrieved
    a replacement and finished the race).\n\nThe winning team consisted of **_Cai
    Lun_** (rookie) and **_Kazuo Ishiguro_** (veteran). Cai said after the race, 'We
    were pretty happy about it, even with the mistakes we made'. Asked if he would
    be racing with an established team this season, 'Not sure about that, after racing
    as a independent racer last season, I was thinking of joining up [with one] of
    the established teams this season, but nothing is set yet.'\n\nThe full results
    are:\n\n1:24:42 - rookie **_Cai Lun_** & veteran **_Kazuo Ishiguro_** (1:23:43
    + 5:00 penalty)  \n1:28:28 - rookie _**Dracoknight**_ & veteran **_Takashi Kurosawa_**
    (1:24:32)  \n1:28:38 - rookie **_Bloodpetal_** & veteran **_Kayleigh Jamieson_**
    (1:26:50)  \n2:06:54 - rookie **_Kira Storm_** & veteran **_NeonFolf_** (2:01:01)\n\nThe
    first full league race is scheduled for Sunday 1st March 111 at 20:00 hours.\n\nMore
