- body: "Many State Protectorate pilots are content with hiding in Caldari Navy protected
    systems; many fleets have been spotted loitering around the gates leading to the
    contested zones. Most of these pilots feel safe in their strongholds and go about
    their normal day to day activities with impunity. Friedrick Psitalon and his pilots
    of The Dead Parrot Shoppe, Inc. have decided to disabuse them of this notion.
    \n\nIn a daring night-time raid, Friedrick led his small tactical fleet through
    Perimeter and into Jita for an attack on State Protectorate militia members in
    this central trading hub of the Caldari State. \n\nFriedrick opened his historic
    attack with: \"CALDARI MILITIA! We are here in defiance of your Navy, who can
    do nothing to stop us! Your military is weak, as is your militia! In your own
    high-security space, you lack the means to defend yourself!\" \n\nWith hours of
    test runs behind them, the fleet moved smoothly into place and took up station
    outside one of the major Caldari Navy trading stations. \n\nFor over an hour,
    the task force harassed any State militia pilots that arrived. At one point, the
    fifteen man fleet dispersed and was involved in four simultaneous engagements.
    Suffering only one loss (to the Caldari Navy itself), the task force destroyed
    twenty-two State Protectorate ships. \n\nNyphix's thoughts after the task force
    vacated Caldari space for the night, summed up the general feeling of the fleet
    : \"Man, and I thought after I joined the Gallente militia I'd never get to go
    to Jita again!\""
