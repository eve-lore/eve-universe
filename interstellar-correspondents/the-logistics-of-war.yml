- body: "In the continuing conflict between the Amarr Militia and those of the Republic
    and Federation the necessity for combat pilots is often the first thought on everyone\u2019s
    mind. However, there is an important role to be played by those not necessarily
    on the front lines of the war, but rather working to make sure that those pilots
    fighting are never left in need of modules, ammo, or even a ship. We spoke to
    members of our militia that hoped to assist in creating a logistical backbone
    to keep our pilots supplied. \n\nHuLiGaNkA, with assistance from Wraithstorm,
    has setup a new initiative to build a strong logistical base for the militia.
    The initiative itself was conceived following a meeting with fellow militia members,
    where they resolved to _\u201Cget logistics sorted\u201D_. They plan to work with
    pilots that can mine, manufacture, and trade, to procure the necessary goods to
    supply militia members.\n\nWhen asking HuLiGaNkA about importance of the work
    they are undertaking she expressed her strong feelings on the matter: _\u201CThe
    lack of logistics might bring us [to an] unfortunate end of this war... and fast.\u201D_
    Wraithstorm had similarly sharp opinions: _\u201Clogistics are the backbone to
    any war effort, with no replacement ships/gear you cannot win a war no matter
    how good you are\u201D_.\n\nAlthough this crucial work has only just begun progress
    has already been made, with HuLiGaNkA mentioning: _\u201CI [have] brought around
    50km3 of Modules, Ammo, and potentially [helpful] items into Kuomi.\u201D_ She
    also commented that they are still looking for more good pilots to assist them:
    _\u201CThe more the merrier. The more people that will join the logistic wing
    the more ships, ammo, modules will be created\u201D_.\n\nAnyone wishing to join
    the effort should join the _\u201C24IC Logistics\u201D_ FTL communications channel,
    where the initiative is being co-ordinated."
