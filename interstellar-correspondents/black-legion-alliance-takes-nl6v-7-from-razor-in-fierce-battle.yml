    \ by ISD Caiden S'or\n\n**Etherium Reach, New Eden -** In the early morning hours,
    the climax of days of fighting ended in the loss of NL6V-7 for RAZOR Alliance
    [-RZR-] to Black Legion. Alliance. [MEN.]\n\nAs the system's Infrastructure Hub
    [I-HUB] came out of its final reinforcement timer on the eleventh of August, MEN.
    forces were bridged in to NL6V-7. A corporate CEO within MEN. who asked not to
    be named, said that an early intel miscue reported that no -RZR- capital ships
    were staged to defend. Thinking to capitalize on an apparent opportunity to attack
    unchallenged, MEN. dreads and sub-caps started taking down the the I-HUB when
    the reinforcement timer was up. Only then did they realize that the scout was
    looking at the wrong system. As the scout was burning to the -RZR- staging system,
    the -RZR- response fleet appeared on the field.\n\n\"We brought in some dreads
    once the ihub became vulnerable, and immediately got couterdropped by the razor
    dread fleet, so the triage carriers went into triage and tried to stem losses\",
    the CEO explains, \"we were losing, so Elo [Knight] ordered all balls to the wall,
    and to drop everything on them.\"\n\nIt was at that point that the MEN. supercarriers
    and titans entered the fight, unquestionably turning the tide. At one point, a
    -RZR- dictor tackled a titan, however it appears that the MEN. Maelstrom fleet
    had little trouble dispatching the tackling interdictors.\n\nIn a conversation
    with Elo Knight, he gives us some insight to Black Legion.'s strategy: \"Win.\"\n\nAnd
    win they did. Final kill totals show that Black Legion. killed 170 RAZOR ships,
    with only 48 losses. 58 Dreadnoughts in total were destroyed in the engagement
    along with 6 carriers. Deadliest ships on the field were the Maelstroms fielded
    by MEN., as the battleships killed 112 enemy ships including some 80 -RZR- Megathrons.\n\nAs
    of Aug 14, Black Legion. has claimed this NL6V-L, with their intentions for the
    system in question. While they have been known to ransom systems back to their
    original holder, it is generally regarded as unlikely that this could be the first
    steps to an invasion into Tribute. A source within the CFC adds this perspective
    on Black Legion's track record, \"Their aim is not to gain and hold sov[ereignty],
    merely to be an annoyance to show the bloc players that they're somebody\".\n\nIn
    answer to why the CFC did not come to -RZR-'s aid in keeping the system to begin
    with, he adds, \"-RZR- does not always ask for assistance.\" By accounts, RAZOR
    felt that they could handle the threat, and the CFC let them.\n\nMembers of RAZOR
    Alliance could not be reached for comment. \n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the
