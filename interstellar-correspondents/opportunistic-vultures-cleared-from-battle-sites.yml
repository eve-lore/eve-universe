    some co-ordination, reports are coming in of marauding salvagers picking over
    the broken remains of the Amarr and Minmatar ships at battle sites that have now
    fallen silent. \n\nAmarrian reaction forces arriving at the scene, too late to
    make a difference, have begun to clear the area of these scavengers. Paladin Major
    Verinus in charge of one such task force making their way to the front lines gave
    a brief comment to reporters on the scene over the system wide frequency via his
    ship\u2019s communications system stating angrily that the salvagers were \"nothing
    more than opportunistic vultures, picking over the remains of our fallen friends.\"
    Soon after clearing the scene his fleet departed the area, leaving a small number
    of ships behind at the graveyards. \n\n_Posted 14:30 GMT_"
