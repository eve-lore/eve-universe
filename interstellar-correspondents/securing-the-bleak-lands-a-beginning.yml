- body: "The CONCORD Assembly\u2019s authorisation of the _\u201CEmergency Militia
    War Powers Act\u201D_ has lead to capsuleers all over new Eden joining the Amarr
    Militia in order to support the Empire. Admittedly the numbers of pilots that
    have joined the militia thus far have been lower than some of the other factions;
    however those taking up the cause have none the less been effective. In the last
    two days our righteous pilots have managed to kill more hostile pilots per militia
    member than two of the three factions.\n\nThis disparity between membership in
    each factional militia has not gone unnoticed by some of our members, with Habraka
    commenting: _\u201CWe're facing a difficult time at the moment, the enemy is more
    organised and has more numbers.\u201D_ We found Habraka alone; defending the contested
    system of Sahtogas, and attempting to prevent it from falling into hostile hands
    by recapturing strategic positions: _\u201Cdefending this system alone - That's
    what happens when your militia is badly outnumbered\u201D_.\n\nHowever, after
    twenty five minutes of perseverance Habraka was joined by four allies who assisted
    him in the task of re-securing the system. Nexnecis Umbra explained his reasoning
    for taking up Habraka\u2019s call: _\u201C[I wished to] assist the fleet and he
    gave me the opportunity\u201D_. It took this small team just 35-40 minutes to
    successfully secure the system, but with many more systems still to be captured
    or re-secured we leave you with this piece of encouragement:\n\n_\u201CI firmly
    believe we will fight back and repel the invaders, after all, willpower and determination
    are what characterizes the Amarr\u201D \u2013 Habraka_"
