    Sansha forces were defeated by a mixed fleet of at least 100 capsuleers and a
    Nation supercarrier was destroyed. This was despite the efforts of Nation loyalists
    who attempted to defend the Sansha forces by activating smartbombs against the
    attacking pilots.  \n  \nSansha forces were first seen in the Parchanier system
    in the Algintal constellation. Once word of the incursion spread, arriving capsuleers
    joined fleets with those they met in the local systems, as Asaface, a pilot involved
    throughout explained: \"There wasnt so much of an autocratic system with our guys,
    we added people who knew people... A lot of blue standings were handed out between
    pilots during these...\"  \n  \nWith pilots meeting for the first time as they
    prepared fleets against the Sansha forces, it was difficult for them to put faith
    into strangers, as Asaface admitted \"it is very difficult to know who to trust
    and who not to trust.\" This comes on the back of reports that some capsuleers
    had witnessed fellow pilots turn upon each other rather than fight back against
    the Sansha.  \n  \nKybernetes Moros of True Slave Foundations, along with several
    Nation loyalist capsuleers, chose to actively protect the Sansha forces and after
    lying in wait for the crucial moment, activated smartbombs. In doing so, loyalist
    Drake Arson revealed that they \"recorded nearly thirty kills\". Kybernetes boasted
    that he was solely responsible for the destruction of \"roughly thirteen T1 frigates
    or smaller and fourteen pods.\"  \n  \nAlthough there were casualties in the battle,
    the Sansha forces were defeated and the first known Sansha Nation supercarrier
    was destroyed. News of the success quickly began to spread throughout New Eden.
    \ \n  \nAs more incursions are reported throughout New Eden, there are those that
    are wholly comitted to helping the Sansha forces. However there are capsuleers
    who are completely dedicated to stopping the Sansha Nation. Asaface is one of
    those capsuleers and he only has one thing in his mind as he prepares for the
    future, and that is \"to get more fleets and bigger fleets, and more organised.\"\n\n*
