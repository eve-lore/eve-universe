    the CVA, as it lost one of its most prominent members and Admirals \u2013 Golan
    Trevize. Today I met with Mr Trevize to discuss his reasons for leaving PIE, a
    corporation he has been a major part of for a number of years. Although he was
    reluctant to give his reasons for leaving past stating that it was for \"personal
    reasons\" due to \"unsolvable differences between myself and PIE senior staff\".
    He was, however, was willing to reiterate that \"the speculations on Gal-net by
    various propagandists are rubbish. From Russo, from Star fraction, from the Ushra\u2019Khan
    - they are all wishful thinking, driven by hate envy and fear.\"   \n  \nResting
    in his estate, Golan informed me that although he had received numerous offers
    for employment upon his retirement from the Amarrian paramilitaries he had not
    decided upon a course of action, but did state that \"I will never lift arms against
    the CVA - that is just the wishful thinking of the terrorists dogs.\"   \n  \nDespite
    the recent events which, along with the resignation of Trevize, include allegations
    made by the CEO of another Ammarian Paramilitary Organization, Russo of corruption
    within the PIE admiralty. PIE are managing to maintain a brave face \u2013 when
    I spoke to vice admiral Siobhan she informed me that PIE were in fact going from
    strength to strength, and that although they have lost a great and inspirational
    leader this will not deter them from their duty to God.   \n  \nWhat long term
    effects this will have is unknown, however we can be sure that the members of
    the Minmatar freedom fighter alliance, the Ushra\u2019Khan are rejoicing as one
    of their most fearsome enemies has left the field of battle.   \n  \nYou can read
