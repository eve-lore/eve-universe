    on the other side of unstable wormholes leads capsuleers to take ever increasing
    risks with their ships and crews. While the potential rewards from gathering artefacts
    amongst the Sleeper and Talocan ruins are undoubtedly high, pioneers face many
    risks in their pursuit of this arcane technology.\n\nOne such pioneer, Foot M
    of FM Corp, recently discovered the consequence of these risks first hand as his
    Chimera class carrier 'HMS Invincible' became stranded in unknown space after
    the entrance vector wormhole collapsed.\n\n\"I wanted to be first in,\" said Foot
    M when questioned on his motivations, \"I believe I might have been the first
    capital pilot to get stuck.\"\n\nThe wormhole that enabled Mr M to travel to the
    new system collapsed under the mass of the carrier, preventing not only Foot M's
    return, but barring anyone from following him.\n\n\"I thought I heard laughter
    on the radio or perhaps it was static,\" says Foot M in his account of the incident,
    \"I began to scan with my basic ship scanner looking for anything that may allow
    me to communicate with home.\"\n\nWithout the necessary instruments to locate
    an exit, Mr. M and his crew found themselves cut off from known space for more
    than three days before continued scanning showed a Condor frigate nearby.\n\n\"I
    beckoned to the pilot of the ship I saw on my scan and by the gods she responded,\"
    said Mr M, after days of scanning and repeated calls on a local band frequency.
    \"She asked me to help her to retrieve the remains of a ship lost to the monsters
    within.\"\n\nAfter assisting the Condor pilot, Caestra Dio of Sev3rance, with
    the salvaging of a Buzzard class covert ship, Mr M was lead out of the system
    via an unstable wormhole to the Curse region.\n\n\"I think he was afraid that
    we would kill him on exit,\" said Ms. Dio, as she recalled the moment she began
    to lead Foot M out of the system. \"He didn't know at that point that Sev3rance
    is a Holder Alliance of Providence and so has an NRDS (Not Red Don't Shoot) Policy.\"\n\n\"She
    never asked for ISK to help me get out which I thought was nice,\" added Foot
    M, giving thanks for Ms. Dio's assistance.\n\nAfter his safe return to known space,
    would Foot M take his carrier back through a wormhole and do it all again? \"Sure,\"
    he says \"if the wormhole required it, or if my buds were being attacked.\"\n\n###
