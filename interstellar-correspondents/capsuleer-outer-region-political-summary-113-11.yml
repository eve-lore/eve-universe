    the Goonswarm Federation alliance capture several more stations, taking five from
    Brick Squad. Morsus Mihi and Brick Squad seem to be drawing their attempt to take
    hold of parts of Delve to a close, with their activity in the region being far
    lower than in previous months. Goonswarm scored 1,790 kills through the month,
    with Delve seeing 15,272 capsuleer vessel losses. Whilst lower than previous months,
    this level is high in comparison to the average of the past few years.  \n  \nOne
    notable event this month was a declaration of war by TEST Alliance against the
    capsuleer Chribba, whose corporation owned an outpost in the 9UY4-H solar system
    in the Providence region. Whilst several capsuleer organisations friendly to Chribba
    stated their displeasure at this move, no substantial defence of the system was
    made with only 422 ships being destroyed in the system during November, not all
    that much higher than the monthly average for January to October this year of
    264. The outpost was successfully captured by TEST Alliance in the early hours
    of the 23rd of the Month, 13 days after the initial declaration.  \n  \nWhilst
    the majority of ship losses in null security space are to other capsuleers, substantial
    numbers of losses are to non-capsuleer pilots such as the Guristas and other pirate
    factions. The variation in the ratio of losses to capsuleers to non capsuleers
    is substantial. The top five and bottom five null security regions in terms of
    this ratio are:  \n  \n<table>  \n<tr>  \n<td>\n\n\n\nTribute\n\n\n</td>  \n<td>\n\n\n\n32.91\n\n\n</td>

    were 32.91 losses to capsuleers, Malpais seems comparatively safe.  \n  \nStatistics
