    Catch** \\- On 15 August 111, combined forces from Ushra'Khan, Atlas Alliance
    [ATLAS] and Against ALL Authorities [.-A-.] clashed against elements from Cold
    Steel Alliance [STEEL] and Curatores Veritatis Alliance [CVA]. More than 600 capsuleers
    participated in the day-long fray and considerable losses were reported on both
    sides.  \n  \nAccording to battle reports, two towers and a cyno jammer defended
    by CVA and its allies (also known as 'proviblock') were ultimately destroyed.[![Bubbled

    \ \n  \nDuring the battle's initial stages, both side took significant casualties.
    \"[Against ALL Authorities] and [Ushra'Khan] were unable to get the upper hand,\"
    explained Sapphrine, adding that ATLAS pilots who joined later in the fight, ultimately
    decided the battle.  \n  \nCALPEPE, an ATLAS capsuleer, recalls: \"i spent all
    my engagement bouncing every gate shooting every single hostile i got in sight.\"
    \ \n  \nDyntheos of CVA, expressed his alliance's satisfaction with the battle's
    outcome: \"I believe the total kill/loss balance in terms of ships is even over
    the day... there are still two Steel towers up i believe... [however] Sov 3 has
    been broken for now,\" he admitted.  \n  \nHovever, Sapphrine, of Ushra'Khan,
    promptly dismissed CVA's claims of even a marginal victory: \"[We] have always
    stated that their objective is to hold the space. Whenever we win a fight they
    invariably claim to have won... as they held the space at the end.\"  \n  \nWhile
    Dyntheos of CVA acknowledges that Ushra'Khan \"has gathered greater confidence
    fighting alongside their [allies],\" he also adds that \"[Against ALL Authorities]
    and [ATLAS] are... probably the most powerful coalitions in the cluster... if
    [Ushra'Khan] had to muster a full fleet to combat the 'provibloc' forces, it means
    they fear us.\"\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this article? Do
