    season on Saturday August 1st, after having completed a succesful test run a few
    months ago. Eve Arena is a service that creates a structured environment for combat-oriented
    capsuleers to find willing combatants for one on one and group combat.[![Caelum

    \ \n  \nRegistration will be free of charge for solo players, and teams will pay
    a 25 million ISK fee that together with donations and advertisement revenue, will
    contribute to covering the cost of prizes for this season's top guns.  \n  \nCaelum
    Dominus, who manages the arena, plans \"to award the top three players in the
    solo division with faction frigates of their choosing\" and top teams with prizes
    in ISK.  \n  \nEve Arena's service will allow capsuleers to arrange mutually agreeable
    times and places for combat. Matches will thus be conducted in agreed upon lowsec
    or nullsec systems.  \n  \nAfter the match, a battle report will be submitted
    and validated by both parties. While no referee will attend matches, mutual respect
    is expected from both sides.  \n  \nDerwent, first season's top scorer, describes
    EVE Arena as \"a good way to get some casual [combat] without having to search
    for a prey.\"  \n  \nMore than 200 pilots fought during the first season and Derwent
    hopes to see \"ten times more\" capsuleers joining season two.  \n  \nInterstellar
    correspondents will follow EVE Arena Events and report as soon as news become
    available.\n\n \n\n### GALNET RESOURCES\n\n[EVE Arena Announcement](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1133235)\n\n
