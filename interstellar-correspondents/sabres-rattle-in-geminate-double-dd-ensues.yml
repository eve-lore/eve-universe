    GEMINATE** \\- Solar Fleet [SOLAR] unleashed multiple doomsday devices at 21:21
    today on a 240 man starbase defense fleet composed of Wildly Inappropriate [WI],
    The Initiative [INIT.], and Majesta Empire [ME].  \n  \nSources indicate Mostly
    Harmless [MH] was also enroute to assist but was forced to burn home after receiving
    reports of a Triumvirate [TRI] attack in progress.  \n  \nAccording to initial
    reports the double doomsday was largely ineffective and resulted in a significant
    number of friendly fire losses. At this time the three [SOLAR] titans (along with
    their support fleet) have left the field. The battle marks the beginning of what
    will likely be an intense weekend of fighting in Geminate.  \n  \nThe conflict
    began on Thursday when [SOLAR] and [SOL-W] reinforced all Wildly Inappropriate
    [WI] sovereignty towers in K25-XD. According to [WI] spokesman Tomcat, the offensive
    came in response to [WI] assaults on three towers held by [SOLAR] in CFYY-J and
    U6D-9A.  \n  \nThe remaining six reinforced [WI] towers in K25-XD are reported
    to be coming out of reinforced mode over the weekend at optimal times for [WI].
    \ \n  \nHistorically K25-XD has functioned as a pivotal system for defenders of
    Geminate. Earlier this year it served as the center point of United Freeman Alliance's
    [UFA] unsuccessful bid to defend its Geminate territory against [WI]. K25-XD is
    one of a handful of station systems in the region and well defended against conventional
    attacks due to its location deep within the region.  \n  \nThe extent of the current
    hostilities has yet to be seen. NC forces are currently heavily engaged in the
    north and south as well as the Drone Regions to a lesser extent. The opening of
    another front with a potentially powerful enemy would certainly add an additional
    element to an already complex situation.  \n  \nMore information to come as the
    weekend progresses.\n\n### GalNet Sources\n\n[SOLAR KB](http://killboard.eve-sobr.com/)\n\n
