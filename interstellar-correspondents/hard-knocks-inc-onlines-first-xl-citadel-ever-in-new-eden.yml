    has been constructed and onlined by [Hard Knocks Inc.](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/Hard_Knocks_Inc.)
    in low orbit over J115405 (Hard Knocks Inc.'s longtime home system, codenamed
    RAGE) on May 19, YC 118.\n\n[![](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/70297/1/Fort_Knocks_under_construction.jpg)](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/70297/1/Fort_Knocks_under_construction.jpg)
    \ \n_Construction begins on Hard Knock 's Keepstar Citadel __  \\- Image courtesy

    for large alliances and coalitions. While all citadels are capable of mooring
    ships, Keepstar citadels are the first structures capable of supporting the docking
    of supercapital ships. While the ability to house ships of all sizes, including
    supercapitals, is a massive benefit in itself, the Keepstar is also able to make
    use of the _Standup Arcing Vorton Projector_ Doomsday weapon.\n\nAccording to
    Hard Knocks inc. planning on building the first Keepstar began as soon as [Upwell
    Consortium announced the development of Citadels](http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/upwell-consortium-announces-development-of-citadel-line-of-stations-for-capsuleer-market/)
    some months ago. While component collection proceeded with few complications,
    Hard Knocks claimed that the contracted builder had plotted not to hand over the
    Citadel as originally agreed. Intelligence was allegedly received that the Capsuleer
    previously contracted to build Fort Knocks was in the employ of another corporation.
    Due to these allegations, Hard Knocks decided to contract another Capsuleer for
    the build. With these measures in place, Hard Knocks Inc. successfully onlined
    the first Keepstar Citadel at 02:17 on Thursday, May 19 th, YC 118.\n\nThe Citadel
    has been named **Fort Knocks** , and orbits a lava planet, giving it that \"supervillain
    lair\" look all the best alliances are going for.\n\n[![](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/70297/1/Fort_Knocks_under_construction_closeup_550.jpg)](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/70297/1/Fort_Knocks_under_constructions_closeup.png)

    Inc. organized a test firing at [Heift's Revelation](https://zkillboard.com/kill/54088212/)
    using the Keepstar's special Doomsday weapon.\n\n[![](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/70297/1/Fort_Knocks_and_its_doomsday_weapon_550.jpg)](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/70297/1/Fort_Knocks_and_its_doomsday_weapon.jpg)

    Blair's Venture](https://zkillboard.com/kill/54088214/). A Phoenix belonging to
    Shadow Wyrm was badly damaged, but survived.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nJ3rzii's
