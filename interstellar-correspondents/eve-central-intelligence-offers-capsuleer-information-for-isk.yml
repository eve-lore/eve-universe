    Eden** \u2013 A new agency has been opened that allows the search of corporation
    roster lists and capsuleer information.   \n  \nKronus Heilgar, founder of EVE
    Central Intelligence, explained that his website collects capsuleer information:
    \u201CI type in a corporation name and it lists all of the members in that corporation.
    It is the end of the era of undercover alts sneaking into enemy corps.\u201D   \n
    \ \nKronus revealed that his inspiration came from \"hearing stories\" of pilots
    camping out in an enemy's home system, cloaked, to try and figure out exactly
    who was in the enemy corporation. He concluded that \"if capsuleers were willing
    to spend hours on end camping out to reach this goal, they'd be willing to pay
    for an instant technological solution for it\u201D.   \n  \nThe price for the
    use of the tool has been set at 40 million ISK, Kronus added, \u201Cpayments can
    be larger or smaller, with the service access time calculated accordingly. The
    minimum payment is 10 million ISK\u201D.   \n  \nDr Volt, diplomat for White Noise.,
    said that she thinks \"it will be a useful tool\", and also stated that such a
    tool may be used within White Noise. in the future.   \n  \nExpansion plans for
    the agency currently include the addition of employment records and \"possibly\"
    kill and loss stats.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[EVE Central Intelligence](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1555452)\n\n*
