    \ \n  \n\u201CGalactic Trading and Logistics are moving to expand their horizons.
    Business has been slow the last few years, so we opted to move our headquarters
    to another region of space. We hope to acquire new contracts for a mutually beneficial
    growth with the local, privately owned, corporations. Inquiries can be made.\u201D
    \  \n  \nWhen asked if the sudden decision to move regions was connected to rumours
    surround Ms. Ne\u2019Rgha\u2019s personal vendetta with an undisclosed third party:
    \ \n  \n\u201CDon\u2019t be preposterous! Such suggestions are untrue and unfit
    for this press conference! We are here to announce a historic day in the history
    of Galactic Trading and Logistics - we\u2019re not here to talk about rumours
    and hearsay.\u201D  \n  \nGalactic Trading and Logistics, a small but old and
    respected corporation, was originally based in the Luminaire system. GTAL primarily
    deals in trafficking and mineral acquisition contracts in which it strives to
    provide customers with affordable hauling fees, raw minerals and goods."
