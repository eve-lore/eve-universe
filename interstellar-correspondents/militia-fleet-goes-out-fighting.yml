- body: "In the few days since the militias were formed many have joined fight to
    secure Amarrian space, and with this time these capsuleers have been working hard
    to become a cohesive combat unit. This can clearly be seen by our militia consistently
    securing more strategic positions per member than any of the opposing factions.\n\nYesterday
    Wraithstorm continued this effort to improve combat effectiveness by calling out
    for militia members to join him in forming a fleet \u201Cto get the pilots used
    to flying together\u201D. He was quickly inundated with pilots who were eager
    to engage the enemy wherever they could be found, with the fleet swelling to over
    70 ships. Once assembled they quickly heard about some 40 Minmatar militia ships
    near the Huola system, only a few jumps from their staging point, the fight was
    on.\n\nQuickly, and efficiently, the fleet moved towards Huola to engage our enemies.
    Upon reaching the system initially the hostile fleet was not engaged, but after
    waiting on the Kourmonen gate for a short time it was discovered that the enemy
    was just on the other side. Our fleet valiantly jumped in to engage.\n\n![Militia

    \ \n[View Visual Record](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2196/igbd.php?file=fleetops.jpg)\n\nInitially
    quick progress was made against the opposing fleet, successfully destroying many
    ships. However, half way through the battle the opposing militia managed to call
    upon additional forces, overwhelming our pilots until they had more than 2 to
    1 advantage. \n\nSadly this resulted in a number of losses to our side, but despite
    this unfortunate turn of events Wraithstorm still considers the operation a success:
    \u201CI am very happy with the outcome. People are closer, and getting to know
    each other, which will lead to much better Militia cohesion and overall effectiveness.\u201D
    Arline Kley, a pilot who was present at the operation, was pleased with his involvement:
    \u201CIt was exhilerating to face a fleet that was more powerful than ours and
    still give them a bloody nose.\u201D"
