    rumors of him leaving the world of crime and vice. I can tell you right now that
    we haven\u2019t seen the last of Verone when it comes to piracy and highway robbery.
    He will be back, however a lot more has been said and announced in this conversation
    \n\nVerone started as a production director in his first corporation after the
    academy, however like many traders he was harassed by pirates and other low lives
    who wanted a share of the spoils he was carrying. It seems to be a reoccurring
    theme of people engaged in combat that they all started as peaceful traders and
    then decided the harassment was enough and made the move to fight back. Verone
    too decided one day it was enough and armed himself and went out looking to deal
    out the justice that had been coming. \n\nVerone: \u201CSo, I took to my guns
    one day, and I must say due to my inexperience I was slaughtered. I was hooked
    on combat ever since I moved my operations to _Sniggerdly_ who at the time were
    under attack from _CVA_ , because of our pirating in the area surrounding the
    deep-space R3K chokepoint and the system Kheram. We spent several months operating
    there before the war came to a violent end and we moved elsewhere to ply our trade.\n\nVerone
    continued to share his story of his life as a member of the well kwown piracy
    corporation and tells us that a real turning point came when he learned the art
    of ransoming. Verone: \u201CI was flying with a friend and we spotted a lone apocalypse
    mining a belt, we attacked it with our badly set up blackbirds and defeated it's
    armor tank, and asked for a ransom. My first ever ransom was paid, fifty million
    isk, split two ways between us and we were happy. Since then just about everyone
    I\u2019ve managed to snare I ransomed, if they had anything of value.\u201D I
    asked Verone why he decided to take a break from piracy, and he told me that for
    the last five week no one refused to pay his ransom and he has been terrible successful.
    Part of his success he owes to his openhearted nature and the fact that he is
    very much in the spotlight, it\u2019s hard to ignore such a charismatic personality.
    In the end people even paid him before he even asked for a price, and that\u2019s
    all because of his fame, people trust his word because they feel they know him.
    It hasn\u2019t been reported that Verone has ever broken his word, that may be
    another reason why people do trust him. \n\nYet, the most important reason Verone
    gave me for his break was his recent relation with a young pilot named Siren Shiva.
    Thanks to Siren Verone was given the possibility to take a vacation is a well
    patrolled region of space under the protection of the _Northern Intelligence_
    and their friends. Veron was full of kind words for Shiva and it does sound like
    he has found a woman who makes a worthy counterpart. Even in this dire time for
    Verone, with the recent loss of his brother, Shiva is there to offer all the support
    he could need. And in that light he asked this question: \n\nVerone: **\"Shiva,
    I love you with all my heart, will you do me the greatest pleasure and honor I
    could ever hope and dream for, and allow me to take your hand in marriage?\"**\n\nI
    only wish more men weren\u2019t so blind to see what\u2019s in front of them,
    and all the single females in eve will surely regret that this noble tough guy
    is taken when or if Siren accepts."
