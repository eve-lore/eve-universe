- body: "It has emerged that a capital class warship belonging to a capsuleer alliance
    operating in the northern fringe regions was captured late last week.   \n  \nThe
    incident, which occurred in the early hours of Friday morning, is reported to
    have been perpetrated by members of the R.I.S.K Alliance - who are believed to
    have removed a fully armed dreadnaught class capital ship from a starbase owned
    by their enemies, the Phoenix Alliance.   \n  \nThe dreadnaught - an Amarrian
    designed Revelation, the \u2018PA Big Daddy\u2019 is the first capital class vessel
    to fall into enemy hands since the Molyneux, a Gallente Soltueur titan was stolen
    by Serpentis forces early last May.   \n  \nSpeaking in an interview on Sunday
    evening - Rasitiln a representative for the R.I.S.K Alliance explained that the
    starbase force field access codes had been discovered by a spy within the Phoenix
    Alliance. This information had allowed a neutral pilot to enter in an Armageddon
    class battleship and physically \u201Cbump [the dreadnaught] out of the force
    field\u201D where Lordmix, a R.I.S.K pilot, boarded the vessel and warped to safety
    while a friendly strike craft kept the starbase defences occupied.   \n  \nRasitiln
    later went on to declare the capture as a \u201Csignificant victory\u201D which
    had \u201Cobviously\u2026 affected moral within the Phoenix Alliance\u201D and
    would aid their ongoing conflict. Going on to state that the R.I.S.K alliance
    would incorporate the \u2018PA Big Daddy\u2019 into its fleet and use it to \u201Ccrush
    [the] Phoenix Alliance\u201D.   \n  \nWhen asked to comment on circumstances surrounding
    the incident. Anihilus, a Phoenix Alliance representative stated that the dreadnaught
    had originally been moved to the more secure starbase facility from its moorings
    at a former Immensea station in the BKG-Q2 Solar System which is now heavily contested
    by both alliances.   \n  \nHe went on to say that the theft had been made possible
    by a \u201Ccombination of spies\u201D and malfunctioning force field technology
    which allowed neutral ships to breach the force field boundaries.   \n  \nUpon
    being queried as to whether the Phoenix Alliance regarded this incident as a setback
    \u2013 Anihilus replied \u201CNot at all,the incident really helped Phoenix Alliance
    to wake up and work as a team, to retake control of the captured solar systems
    and stations and destroy all hostile starbases\u201D. He later conveyed his personal
    gratitude to all members of his alliance and their allies who had assisted Phoenix
    Alliance in their time of need.   \n  \nWhen asked to comment on this, Rasitiln
    of R.I.S.K put the loss of control of these key systems following the dreadnaught
    capture down to \u201Chuman error\u201D. Adding that R.I.S.K would not be defeated
    so easily \u201Cthough our presence in the area is slightly diminished until we
    regroup and formulate a new plan of attack\u201D."
