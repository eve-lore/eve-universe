- body: "![](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/assets/icarticlebanner.png)  \n  \nThe Drone
    Regions have undergone a dramatic reshaping as CONCORD begin issuing bounties
    upon the destruction of Rogue Drones. In line with this change, valuable extracted
    drone alloys are no longer available.   \n  \nZazhas, an officer within Ethereal
    Dawn [ED], believes that these changes will bring about \u201Cmore co-operation\"
    between miners and combat pilots. When it comes to manufacturing, he feels that
    while transport of goods can be problematic in null-sec, these changes may require
    a few more imports.   \n  \nSyndic Naismith, a member of Broken Toys [FUHRD],
    believes that the changes will hurt budding industrial alliances that used the
    Drone Regions as an industrial hub for manufacturing, but also concedes that the
    amount of minerals made available by drone alloys did provide Drone Region industrialists
    with an unfair advantage.   \n  \nWhile CONCORD pays bounties in line with the
    destruction of other null-sec pirates, combat pilots have pre-emptively commented
    that Rogue Drones apparently drop very little items of value and as such both
    industrial and combat pilots may struggle.   \n  \nWhile alliances move in and
    out of null-sec space all the time, some entities such as Ethereal Dawn are there
    to stay and it is those that hope the Drone Regions will not become a mass wasteland
    of poverty and destruction.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this
