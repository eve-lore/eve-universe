- body: "Welcome to Day Three of the **Fifth Alliance Tournament**. Here are the initial
    results and reviews of the first eight matches of the day. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match
    33: Blood Blind Vs The Star Fraction**\n\nAnother loss for Blood Blind and a much-needed
    win for the revolutionaries of SF.\n\n**Blood Blind:** 3 Tempest | 3 Rifters |
    4 Maulus   \n**The Star Fraction:** 5 Deimos | 5 Griffin\n\nWith both teams starting
    at close range it looked as if it would be a brutal slugfest and that it was.
    SF came out strong and disciplined, dropping multiple support ships almost immediately
    before moving on to the Tempests. By the time their first Deimos and Griffin were
    down they\u2019d removed almost all support and taken the first Tempest into low
    armor. Clever target calling and some capacitor warfare in the shape of nosferatu
    fitted to their Deimos saw them cut the Tempests quickly down with ease. \n\n*
    * *\n\n**Match 34: When Fat Kids Attack Vs The Kadeshi**\n\nA slow and arduous
    fight for both teams, who fielded and were up against strong logistics chains.
    The Kadeshi came away with a win against some resilient opponents.\n\n**When Fat
    Kids Attack:** 3 Dominix | Hugin | Griffin  \n**The Kadeshi:** Megathron | Dominix
    | 2 Guardians | Crow\n\nIt was another match with a close-range start this time;
    both teams sitting near one another and blasting away immediately. Early on The
    Kadeshi removed an opposition Griffin, making good use of their Crow. From there
    the fight slowed down, with a stalemate between both teams forming. After a few
    minutes however, Ovek\u2019s Dominix began to slip deeper towards hull as The
    Kadeshi continued to apply pressure.\n\nFATTY clung on, throwing as much damage
    and capacitor neutralization at their enemies as they could. In the face of some
    solid logistics piloting however, The Kadeshi never really looked under threat.
    Despite a resilient tanking session, Ovek\u2019s Dominix eventually fell and from
    there it was all over \u2013 a points win for The Kadeshi as time was called.
    \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 35: Hydra Alliance Vs SMASH Alliance**\n\nA slow but sure
    win from Hydra \u2013 with both sides fielding barely any major damage-dealers
    and playing it safe. \n\n**Hydra Alliance:** 2 Guardians | Curse | Rook | 2 Thorax
    \ \n**SMASH Alliance:** 3 Scorpion | Guardian\n\nDespite some early damage on
    the Rook, neither side managed to dish out any decent damage and a stalemate quickly
    formed. For a long time it looked as if the only casualties from the match would
    be a mass of Hydra drones \u2013 obliterated by some mid-match smartbombing from
    SMASH. \n\nDespite this, late in the match their own Guardian came under threat
    from the Rook and Curse and after a long amount of damage from the enemy Thorax,
    it went down. From there, two more Scorpions fell just before time was called.
    \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 36: Notoriety Alliance Vs Synchr0nicity**\n\nAnother extremely
    strong showing by Notoriety who wielded the same devastating combination of Sansha
    ships. They join the equally-promising Green Alliance as a team with two wins
    and two totalhelldeaths.\n\n**Notoriety Alliance:** 3 Phantasm | Scimitar | 2
    Moa | Cruor | Sentinel  \n**Synchr0nicity:** 2 Megathron | 2 Guardian | Crusader\n\nWith
    their Crusader removed by support immediately and their Guardian primaried by
    the alpha-heavy Notoriety team, it looked grim from the beginning for Synchr0nicity.
    Their first Guardian fell rapidly under the savage fire from the Sansha vessels
    and the rest of the team collapsed quickly afterwards. A resounding lesson to
    anyone who thinks wielding the dual-logistics setup is a guaranteed win. \n\n*
    * *\n\n**Match 37: Pandemic Legion Vs Mercenary Coalition**\n\nBoth teams fielded
    similar formations in this highly-anticipated match up \u2013 sporting differing
    variations on the common dual-logistics setup. Pandemic came away with a win,
    making good use of their Curse to break past their opponents logistics chain.\n\n**Pandemic
    Legion:** Armageddon | 2 Guardians | Curse | Vexor Navy Issue  \n**Mercenary Coalition:**
    2 Dominix | 2 Guardians | Malediction\n\nMC\u2019s Malediction was an early casualty
    of the match, leaving what first seemed like yet another stalemate. Under threat
    from the cap neutralization of the Curse however, Zakma\u2019s Guardian slowly
    started to fall. MC made the tactical decision to clear the drones threatening
    the Guardian, using smartbombs at close range to it. Zakma\u2019s Guardian held
    on bravely but eventually fell as the Vexor Navy Issue closed the distance and
    dropped some additional turret fire.\n\nPandemic made a play for the totalhelldeath
    win; sending the Curse off to chase the Guardian as its teammates finished the
    Dominix. With the Guardian in deep armor, they almost grabbed it before time was
    called. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 38: Ethereal Dawn Vs Brutally Clever Empire**\n\nEthereal
    Dawn pulled ahead of their group with a decisive victory against Bruce.\n\n**Ethereal
    Dawn:** Scorpion | 2 Drakes | Basilisk | Cerberus  \n**Brutally Clever Empire:**
    Basilisk | Drake | 2 Cerberus | 2 Crows | Kitsune | 2 Griffins\n\nAlmost instantly
    as the fight began, Bruce were losing support vessels. First to go was a Kitsune,
    soon followed by its two Griffin companions. For a few moments it looked like
    the fighting would slow down but under some heavy fire, the Bruce Basilisk dipped
    quickly into low shields and caved. Next were the Cerberus and Drake, leaving
    only the two Crows. Under some intense missile fire, the first crow fell but the
    second was able to maintain enough velocity and easily dodged the rain of missiles
    and pursuant drones. A thorough victory from Ethereal Dawn who were denied the
    totalhelldeath. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 39: Cosa Nostra. Vs The Crimson Federation**\n\nA
    victorious outcome once again for Cosa Nostra. who pulled out a good win against
    The Crimson Federation.\n\n**Cosa Nostra.:** 2 Abaddon | Megathron | Dramiel |
    Rifter | Maulus | 4 Griffins  \n**The Crimson Federation:** Abaddon | Dominix
    | Raven | 2 Crucifiers | 2 Maulus | 2 Griffins\n\nWith masses of frigates on either
    side it looked as if a lot of ships would be going down. Both teams targeted Battleships
    to begin with however. Crimson\u2019s Dominix was made primary and dropped rapidly
    in exchange for some heavy damage on their opposition\u2019s Megathron. Next to
    fall was the Crimson\u2019s Raven, taking heavy damage from the lasers of the
    Abaddons.\n\nSeeing that they only had a few moments left before it was all over,
    Crimson Federation took out a Griffin to deny their opponents a totalhelldeath,
    and almost followed it with a Megathron kill. They died too quickly before they
    could take it down however, and the Cosa Nostra. Megathron remained on the battlefield
    at the end, deep into structure. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 40: Interstellar Alcohol
    Conglomerate Vs Blade.**\n\nIAC walked away with a victory thanks to their opponents
    ships leaving the arena.\n\n**Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate:** 2 Basilisks
    | Drake | 4 Moas  \n**Blade.:** 2 Basilisks | Curse | 4 Manticores | Taranis\n\nDuring
    the opening of the fight it was an incredibly even match; both sides testing the
    abilities of their opposing logistics pilots. For a moment it looked as if IAC
    were about to lose a Basilisk but some rapid support from Tyrrax saved it with
    around 90% hull left to go.\n\nThe stalemate resumed up until Blade shot themselves
    in the foot, with one Basilisk drifting outside the Arena and facing the wrath
    of game officials. Another Basilisk of theirs disappeared just as rapidly, this
    time under fire from the IAC Moas. The majority of the rest of the team dropped
    fast, with yet another ship leaving the arena. Proxay from Blade however, denied
    IAC their much-needed totalhelldeath victory with some evasive maneuvers in his
    Taranis. \n\n* * *\n\n_Eve-TV Coverage : Day Three -[View](http://www.eve-online.com/evetv)_"
