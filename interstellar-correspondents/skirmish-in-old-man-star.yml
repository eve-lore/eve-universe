- body: "Outnumbered almost three to one, a Federal Defence Union fleet of twenty
    five pilots engaged a State Protectorate fleet in the Old Man Star system. \n\nAaron
    Mirrorsaver's fleet was assembling in Nisuwa when communications were relayed
    concerning an inbound Protectorate fleet of at least sixty pilots. Rather than
    engage the fleet with the fourteen or fifteen pilots at hand, Mirrorsaver pulled
    the fleet back to Old Man Star and called for reinforcements. \n\nBy the time
    the Protectorate fleet reached Old Man Star, Mirrorsaver's fleet numbered no more
    than twenty five pilots. Despite the overwhelming odds, our pilots immediately
    attacked the invaders and took out at least four enemy vessels before being pushed
    back. \n\nFurther fighting was denied us as the Protectorate fleet turned tail
    and headed back towards Nisuwa."
