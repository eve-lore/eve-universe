    by TRUST regarding their production and delivery of the very first Mothership-class
    vessel in private hands, the Band of Brothers alliance declared that it would
    be attacking the conglomerate\u2019s Outpost in EC-P8R.  \nMustering what is possibly
    the largest allied pod-pilot fleet, composed of Ascendant Frontier, Axiom Empire,
    Band of Brothers, The Five and The Forsaken Empire pilots, they removed all defenses
    in that system, claiming the Outpost for their own. The task involved taking down
    no less then thirty-six Starbases in less then a week, the final one having been
    destroyed yesterday morning. \n\nThe military campaign started last Friday as
    the large force moved into the EC-P8R system. The number of pilots in the fleet
    numbered over six hundred, all capsule-cleared pilots, forty of which were Capital
    ships, mostly Dreadnoughts. After securing the system, an act that took less then
    a few hours, a cynosural field was created. The Capital ships were brought in
    and wasted no time in assaulting the Starbases that TRUST had put up to secure
    the system's sovereignty. [Interstellar Correspondents on location have captured
    the following footage.](http://www.eve-ic.com/movies/EC-P8R.wmv)\n\nThe reason
    for the attack, according to the BoB alliance, is that they contested TRUST's
    neutrality. They claimed that one of their members, Omega Enterprises, is the
    industrial branch of Cataclysm Enterprises, a member of the G Alliance.  \nTRUST,
    however, still deny being G's industrial wing today and maintains its claim of
    political neutrality. Studi, CEO of Omega Enterprises, said that \u201CCataclysm
    Enterprises is only a customer,\u201D and that both are separate entities, OE
    being \u201Cone of the oldest pod-pilot corporations.\u201D According to Studi
    and Ovaron, CEO of The X-Trading Company, the invading forces were \u201Cscared
    that TRUST would sell Capital ships to their enemies.\u201D To them, their attackers
    ignored the fact that \u201CTRUST would sell to them as well.\u201D Despite of
    this assault affecting the industrial conglomerate\u2019s operations; the directorship
    was still open to negotiations, something BoB have never officially turned down.
    Their actions, however, speak for themselves.  \nTRUST deplored the fact that
    the invading parties were not open for discussions or dialogue of any kind. \n\nTRUST\u2019s
    close neighbours G Alliance also refuted all claims that TRUST would be their
    industrial branch. According to Cmd Woodlouse, a G senior official, the assault
    on the Outpost and Capital Shipyards in EC-P8R was mounted because the invading
    forces \u201Cthink that G Alliance receives equipment and ships from Omega Enterprises
    free of charge.\u201D This is a claim that he denied, stating that \u201CCE buys
    equipment from OE and TRUST as any other corporation would.\u201D \n\nTo the invading
    forces, progress has been very satisfying with the removal of TRUST\u2019s sovereignty
    in the system, the subsequent capture of the Gallente Administrative Outpost and
    the final achievement; destruction of all starbases and Capital Ship yards in
    EC-P8R. The system, since last Friday, has remained in near-to-total lockdown
    by the besieging forces and will remain so for the foreseeable future."
