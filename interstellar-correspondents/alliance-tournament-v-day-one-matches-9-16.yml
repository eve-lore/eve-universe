    many entrants have entertained the crowds with spectacles of great piloting, stunning
    victory, ruthless aggression and shocking defeat.  \n\n\nContinuing our rundown
    of the matches from day one, we now bring you a review of the last eight matches.
    \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 9: Triumvirate. Vs United Corporations Against Macros**\n\nA
    resounding win for Triumvirate., who stuck to a tried-and-tested defensive team
    formation which easily brushed aside a far more experimental one fielded by UCAM.
    \n\n**United Corporations Against Macros:** 3 Ravens | Bellicose | Arbitrator
    \ \n**Triumvirate.:** Curse | Ishtar | Rook | 2 Guardians | Griffin \n\nAs the
    Arbitrator dropped within the first minute of the fight, it was clear that Triumvirate.
    would be coming out of this match with their first win. Next came the Bellicose
    and by this point it was all over. With not only the dual-logistics setup, but
    also shield and armor repair drones assisting the Guardian under fire, UCAM never
    stood a chance at breaking the logistics ring with the three Ravens that remained.
    \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 10: Exa Nation Vs The Fourth District**\n\nThe Fourth District
    came away with a well deserved victory, but Exa Nation\u2019s early assault denied
    them a totalhelldeath. \n\n**Exa Nation:** 2 Caracals | Myrmidon | 2 Drakes |
    Nighthawk  \n**The Fourth District:** 5 Cerberus | 5 Griffins \n\nThe fight got
    off to an explosive opening as the combined firepower of The Fourth District brought
    down two Caracals, whilst the early barrage from Exa Nation destroyed their opponent\u2019s
    frigate support. This did little to slow The Fourth District as they continued
    to take down the enemies larger ships one at a time with focused firepower, meanwhile
    maintaining their own shields to avoid losing any of their heavy assault cruisers.
    \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 11: DeStInY. Vs The Five**\n\nIn a brutal match, The Five
    used a well proven setup to gain victory over DeStInY.\n\n**DeStInY.:** Maelstrom
    | Basilisk | Caracal | Thrasher | Cormorant | Catalyst | 3 Kitsune | Succubus
    \ \n**The Five:** 2 Basilisk | 5 Manticore | 2 Hound \n\nIt all started fast as
    the initial wave of fire from both sides took down one of The Five\u2019s Hounds,
    but a spread of fire neutralized the frigate support of DeStInY. fairly rapidly.
    As the Maelstrom closed on The Five they pulled apart the rest of DeStInY.\u2019s
    team, using a tight remote repair pattern to avoid further losses from the incoming
    fire. A strong victory for The Five. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 12: Atlas Alliance Vs
    Divine 0rder**\n\nWielding ten Caracals, Divine Order slowly and systematically
    locked down and destroyed the smaller, heavier team of Atlas Alliance with minimal
    losses. \n\n**Atlas Alliance:** 5 Drakes | Blackbird  \n**Divine 0rder:** 10 Caracals
    \n\nA missile-intensive slugfest exemplifying Caldari warfare philosophy. The
    first volley from Divine 0rder destroyed the Atlas Alliance Blackbird within five
    seconds, with Atlas Alliance claiming a Caracal in return shortly after. But with
    a swathe of ECM Drones from the army of Caracals, the Drakes found it very difficult
    to keep the fight two sided. Slowly but surely, the intensive firepower from the
    Caracals took down the remaining Drakes. Divine 0rder sealed the victory with
    only two losses. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 13: GoonSwarm Vs United Legion**\n\nWith
    the GoonSwarm team losing 10 points before the match began because of early movement,
    United Legion went on to take victory in a hard fought match. \n\n**GoonSwarm:**
    6 Ruptures | Thorax | Guardian | Catalyst | Griffin  \n**United Legion:** Harbinger
    | 2 Onieros | 4 Thorax \n\nWith the GoonSwarm Guardian looking to have placed
    itself slightly too far from its gang, the fight began and saw hordes of drones
    launched from both sides and the GoonSwarm team losing a couple of ships to focused
    fire whilst concentrating their fire on one of the United Legion logistic vessels.
    As the Oneiros went down, United Legion split their fire amongst the enemy and
    slowly took them down one at a time. \n\nAlthough using remote repair modules
    and focusing fire, the GoonSwarm team were unable to capitalize and lost several
    more ships before destroying the second logistic cruiser. Without too much trouble,
    the United Legion went on to destroy the last of the GoonSwarm team and took victory
    in what was a well fought match. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 14: RONA Alliance VS Nebula
    Rasa**\n\nIn a brutal match between these two teams, twin battleship firepower
    with support on both sides made for an interesting fight that Nebula Rasa eventually
    won. \n\n**RONA Alliance:** Tempest | Dominix | Curse | Basilisk | 2 Griffins
    \ \n**Nebula Rasa:** 2 Megathrons | 2 Guardians | 2 Vigils\n\nFielding two similar
    fleets, we saw a pair of heavy damage battleships on each side being supported
    by logistics and frigates, with RONA Alliance choosing a Curse rather than a second
    logistics cruiser. This may have been the deciding factor as both teams focused
    fire on the opposing logistic vessels, with the Basilisk succumbing first and
    leaving RONA Alliance without repair support. \n\nAs both teams lost their frigates,
    RONA Alliance continued to pile firepower onto one of the opposing Guardians,
    but could not break its tank as the second logistics ship supported it. One by
    one, RONA Alliance lost ships to the pair of Megathrons and Nebula Rasa took the
    win. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 15: Morsus Mihi VS R0ADKILL**\n\nThe fifth Totalhelldeath
    of the tournament came as Morsus Mihi flew a well-tested and powerful setup against
    R0ADKILL and won decisively. \n\n**Morsus Mihi:** 2 Basilisks | 4 Manticores |
    3 Hounds  \n**R0ADKILL:** Nighthawk | 2 Drakes | Basilisk | Blackbird | 2 Griffins
    \n\nWith the ability to apply fast damage and with expert control of remote repair
    systems, Morsus Mihi controlled the battle from start to finish as they lined
    up targets and took them down efficiently. None of their ships ever coming into
    danger of being destroyed, it was a masterful victory and set them up as the team
    to beat in Group H. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 16: KIA Alliance VS Ushra\u2019Khan**\n\nIn
    the final match of day one, KIA Alliance met Ushra\u2019Khan in battle. A hard
    fight to call at the beginning, Ushra\u2019Khan took the upper hand with clever
    use of electronic warfare and earned themselves a comfortable victory. \n\n**KIA
    Alliance:** 4 Ishtars | Oneiros | 3 Griffins  \n**Ushra\u2019Khan:** Sleipnir
    | 3 Ruptures | 3 Thorax | Kitsune | 2 Griffins \n\nThe battlefield obscured by
    drones, Ushra\u2019Khan took the fight to KIA Alliance using their high damage
    cruisers to remove the frigate support and lone logistics cruiser before their
    first Rupture went down in flames. \n\nTaking down an Ishtar, KIA Alliance lost
    a quarter of their combat ability but managed to finish off two of the badly damaged
    Thorax's. With superior numbers and their E-War frigates still in tact, U\u2019K
    went to work on the last three Ishtars rendered vulnerable by the loss of the
    Oneiros, and eventually walked away with a convincing and impressive victory.
    \n\n* * *\n\nNow that day one is over, the stage has been set for what standards
    have to be maintained. Several teams have rushed to the lead of their respective
    groups and others are left flagging behind. But nothing is certain yet and there
    is still everything to be played for. \n\nFrom here we will see who adapts, who
    perseveres, and who has what it takes to push their way to victory and claim one
    of the coveted top two spots in each group. \n\nPlease join us tomorrow for further
    reports as the action unfolds live. \n\n* * *\n\n_Eve-TV Coverage: Day One_  \n[View](http://www.eve-online.com/evetv/tunein.asp)"
