    our rundown of the matches from day two, we now bring you a review of the last
    eight matches. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 25: Triumvirate. Vs The Fourth District**\n\nIt
    was another solid performance from Triumvirate. and another totalhelldeath for
    them, placing them in a strong position in their group and putting them next to
    the Green Alliance in terms of performance so far. \n\n**Triumvirate.:** 2 Megathrons
    | 2 Onieros | 2 Griffins  \n**The Fourth District:** Abaddon | 2 Ishtars | Guardian
    | 4 Griffins | 2 Maulus  \n\n\nAs The Fourth District griffins began to fall immediately,
    it began to look like there would be a tough fight ahead for the Caldari loyalists.
    They refused to give up however, bringing an opposition Oneiros into significant
    armor damage before it climbed back into safe grounds thanks to friendly logistics
    support. Having dealt with their own enemy's support, Triumvirate were now free
    to focus on The Fourth District Guardian, taking it apart with ease. From there,
    it was only the task of mopping up the Ishtars and then the Abaddon. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match
    26: Exa Nation Vs The Church.**\n\nA powerful showing by The Church. who tore
    apart the Exa Nation team with a well-executed and formulated team. \n\n**Exa
    Nation:** 2 Basilisk | 4 Cerberus | Manticore | Griffin  \n**The Church.:** 4
    Deimos | Rook | 4 Griffins \n\nThe Church. displayed some thoughtful placement
    in this match, sitting their Rook at extreme range with the Griffins slightly
    in front. Locking down their enemies from the beginning with a mass of ECM, they
    covered the approach of their Deimos, which arrived on top of the Basilisks by
    the time they\u2019d lost their first Griffin. It wasn\u2019t long until the Basilisks
    were taking heavy damage and destroyed, eventually followed by the losses of Exa
    Nation\u2019s Griffins and Cerberus. An impressive first match for The Church,
    whom many are anticipating will deliver some stiff competition this tournament.
    \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 27: DeStInY. Vs Divine 0rder**\n\nIt was another long-lasting
    match this time, with DeStInY. pulling out an impressive win against Divine 0rder
    as they defied expectations and hung on against some tenacious Dominix. \n\n**DeStInY.:**
    2 Basilisks | Arbitrator | 4 Manticores | Hound | Nemesis  \n**Divine 0rder:**
    3 Dominix | Curse | Rifter \n\nEarly on in the fight, it looked as if it was all
    over for Divine 0rder, who lost their Rifter and Curse quickly, with no losses
    to DeStInY. Refusing to give up however, they charged into the fray with their
    three Domini. For minutes it remained unclear who would emerge victorious, but
    as a Divine 0rder Dominix started to seep into low armor and hull damage, it started
    to look like they would be handing their opponents a totallhelldeath victory.
    When a Dominix dropped, warping out, it seemed almost a certainty. With some tenacious
    fighting however, they actually managed to whittle down their opponents with clever
    drone use, eventually denying their opponents full points by removing multiple
    bombers from the field before time was called. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 28: Atlas
    Alliance Vs Ev0ke**\n\nEv0ke pulled out a totalhelldeath win against Atlas Alliance,
    with a solid team that was deployed with impressive efficiency. \n\n**Atlas Alliance:**
    Apoc | 2 Guardian | 3 Thorax  \n**Ev0ke:** Harbinger | 2 Guardian | Curse | 2
    Rupture \n\nWith both teams fielding a dual-logistics setup, it was set to be
    an interesting test of who could overcome the other's setup. Almost two minutes
    passed before there was any damage laid by either side. Eventually however, Ev0ke
    began to turn the tide by using ECM drones and cap neutralization to break past
    the logistics used by their opponents. It wasn\u2019t long afterwards until an
    Atlas Thorax was in deep trouble and the other two were following it's fate. From
    there they set upon the Guardians, which were clearly jammed and incapacitated.
    An impressive counter by Ev0ke, to the often-used dual-logistics formation. \n\n*
    * *\n\n**Match 29: GoonSwarm Vs Nebula Rasa**\n\nNebula Rasa came away with their
    second win of the tournament with a totalhelldeath victory giving GoonSwarm their
    second loss. \n\n**GoonSwarm:** 3 Abaddons | Rapier  \n**Nebula Rasa:** Dominix
    | Myrmidon | 2 Ishtar | Guardian \n\nIt was an interesting setup fielded from
    both teams; an alpha-heavy GoonSwarm team against another unique formation from
    Nebula Rasa who continue to impress with well formulated teams that are used to
    maximum efficiency. With GoonSwarm putting out some immense alpha-strike, they
    looked at some points as if they were going to break the tanks on Danton Marcellus'
    Ishtar and later, the Guardian. Their own Rapier dropped quickly early in the
    fight however, and the expertly-deployed remote logistics of Nebula Rasa proved
    too resilient even in the face of impressive damage. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 30:
    RONA Alliance VS HUN Reloaded**\n\nLast year\u2019s Champions came away with a
    decisive and brutal victory against some interesting tactics from RONA Alliance.
    \n\n**RONA Alliance:** Sleipnir | 2 Basilisks | 2 Arbitrators | 4 Griffins  \n**HUN
    Reloaded:** 9 Thorax | Blackbird \n\nIt looked at the beginning as if there was
    an error with warp in range from RONA, who had landed one of their Basilisks in
    amidst a menacing nine Thorax. HUN had a quick attempt at taking it down and found
    some stiff logistics resistance, which questions whether in fact it was an error
    after all. Pinning the close-ranged Basilisk and maintaining discipline; HUN focused
    more fully on removing the enemy Griffins from the field. From there they then
    turned their ECM drones upon their enemies logistics and a jam eventually came.
    The moment they had removed one logistics vessel from the fight things began to
    come apart for RONA. The Champions make a victorious re-entry to the tournament,
    but will face tough battle ahead in their group. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 31: Morsus
    Mihi VS Ushra'Khan**\n\nIt was an absolute brawl of a fight this time around,
    and when it comes to brawls the Minmatar know best. Ushra'Khan come away with
    another impressive win and this time something of an upset. \n\n**Morsus Mihi:**
    Myrmidon | 2 Vexors | 6 Arbitrators  \n**Ushra'Khan:** 4 Ruptures | 6 Thorax \n\nMorsus
    Mihi immediately launched an impressive swarm of drones as the fight broke out,
    taking out a Rupture and Thorax in exchange for two of their own Arbitrators.
    Their drones however, had their own idea about who to target next and without
    a lock to direct them, MM fire was spread across three Ushra'Khan vessels, who
    continued to focus their own fire on a single target and pull ahead in this war
    of attrition. Three more Arbitrators fell before the next Ushra\u2019Khan vessel
    and by the end of the match 3 Ruptures and 3 Thorax were still standing on the
    battlefield. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 32: KIA Alliance VS eXceed.**\n\neXceed. went
    down against KIA Alliance who just barely managed to hold on to their victory.
    \n\n**KIA Alliance:** 2 Megathrons | 2 Guardians | 2 Griffins  \n**eXceed.:**
    10 Thorax \n\nFrom the beginning it looked as if KIA Alliance were up for an almost
    impossible fight, with their small and critically-exposed team potentially facing
    a swathe of ECM drones and immense firepower from the amassed Thorax gang. It
    wasn\u2019t to be however, as eXceed. opted instead for a pure firepower approach,
    sending off their drones first to destroy the Griffins and then working on the
    Guardian. It was a tremendously close fight for a while, with the Guardian only
    barely hanging on as the two Megathrons masterfully whittled away the approaching
    Thorax and slowly reduced their damage output to something unable to break the
    dual-logistics team. \n\n* * *\n\n_Eve-TV Coverage: Day Two_  \n[View](http://www.eve-online.com/evetv/tunein.asp)"
