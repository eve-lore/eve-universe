    Militia have taken the last remaining system controlled by their Gallentean foes.
    Mercomesier fell last Sunday following a coordinated attack on the system's control
    bunker by members of The 22nd Black Rise Defensive Unit, Space Perverts, The Cadre,
    and the State Protectorate.  \n  \nThe recent Caldari victory was the last in
    a series of successes that week, with the militia managing to secure occupancy
    over three other systems. Hussain, a member of the Gallente militia who was in
    Mercomesier on Sunday, believes \"members in the militia had given up on our systems
    some time ago. The militia wants to fight but don't really have goals other than
    the next kill.\"[![The system's control bunker](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3113/caldarivgallentethumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F3113%2Fcaldarivgallente.png)
    \ \n  \nAccording to Olzi, a member of the Caldari militia, the reasons for their
    dominance simply came down to \"the willingness to live in lowsec, instead of
    basing from hisec. When you live in hisec, pirates and the opposing militia members
    will make it extremely difficult to pass through those bottleneck systems.\" In
    addition, \"the coordination between the Caldari corporations has also been pretty
    efficient. Very early we decided which corporations would base from which constellations,
    and this way keep their own systems secure.\"  \n  \nStonercoco, an employee of
    a corporation which is loosely allied with the Gallente Militia, thinks they will
    have to struggle to make a comeback: \"... nearly all of their defeats have been
    painful. every system the caldari has taken has been too easy. gallente are too
    small. caldari are too big. and determined.\" Hassain also has doubts about the
    militia fighting back: \"I really dont know, the militia does [fight] and its
    willing to take on poor odds in battle.\"  \n  \nRecords support Stonercoco's
    views about the disparity in membership levels; the number of registered pilots
    in the Caldari militia being almost double that of the Gallente. Despite the disparity,
    Gallente forces still manage to outpace the number of ships destroyed per pilot
    than their counterparts. Unfortunately, failure to defend strategic assets in
    favor of kill tallies has led to this major defeat.  \n  \nOnly time can tell
    if they can regain any of their lost ground. Interstellar Correspondents will
    continue to monitor the situation.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events
