    \ by ISD Tedra Kerrigan\n\nSeveral days ago, Interstellar Correspondents received
    the notice below directly from Somerset Mahm with the stipulation that we hold
    the announcement. Now that the announcement has been [made public](http://community.eveonline.com/news/newsFromEve.asp?newsTitle=somer-blink-awards-270-billion-isk-to-tournament-teams),
    we present to you the message:\n\n\"SOMER Blink, the popular Eve gambling site,
    will be sponsoring all thirty-two Open Tournament entrants as they attempt to
    claw their way to victory. It is Blink's hope that sponsoring everyone will lead
    to more exciting fights than ever before by equalizing the ability of each team
    to select the best ships they can.\n\nEach team which has been selected to play
    in the Tournament will receive 10 billion ISK, courtesy of SOMER Blink. Included
    is a copy of the letter sent to each team captain alongside the Blink donation:\n\n_Greetings!_\n\n_As
    team captain, you are receiving this message because SOMER Blink has sent 10 billion
    ISK to your wallet, earmarked for the purpose of purchasing ships, modules, implants,
    and supplies for the upcoming Tournament. It is our hope that this will allow
    your team to field the exact setups you hope will give you the best chance of
    victory, and so the Tournament may be decided on the basis of pilot skill rather
    than financial strength._\n\n_There are no conditions or requirements associated
    with the receipt of this ISK. We ask only that it be used to provide the tournament
    spectators a fantastic show! You have no obligation to return unused ISK or to
    mention SOMER Blink in any communications or announcements, though we would appreciate
    your confirmation of receipt so we can ensure all teams have been sponsored._\n\n_Best
    of luck in the upcoming tournament!_\n\n_Yours truly,  \nSomerset Mahm  \non behalf
    of SOMER Blink  \n<http://cogdev.net/blink/>\"_\n\nElise Randolph of team [Why
    Dash](https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&m=2173669#post2173669)
    said that, being part of Pandemic Legion they were not known for needing financial
    backing, but added that she thought Somerset was 'a good man'.\n\nWarr Akini,
    captain of [Oxygen Isonopes](https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&m=2173707#post2173707),
    said that while they did not need the money either, they were very pleased to
    see organizations out there trying to make the fights more interesting. He also
    stated his intention to 'embezzle the crap out of it' in true New Eden tradition.
    Now that his intention has been outed it remains to be seen how successful he
    is.\n\n \n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this article? Do you have
