    hours after the attack on the CONCORD Bureau Station we travelled to Yulai to
    gather the reactions of pod pilots about the organisations involvement in the

    \ \n[View Visual Record](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2178/igbd.php?file=station.jpg)\n\nThe
    local FTL communications channel was abuzz with discussion, with many talking
    about CONCORD\u2019s current situation. Seth Allasatre commented that the organisation
    had been \u201Ccaught with their pants down\u201D, while in a private conversation
    Brzhk expressed his belief in CONCORD\u2019s role as New Eden\u2019s peacemaker:
    \u201CReally, they were doing an amazing job - not perfect, but what they were
    representing really makes this action a terrorist attack more than anything else.\u201D\n\nCruzius
    expressed his belief that the organisation will get through these troubling times
    \u201CI think they will get stronger\u201D, and in passing mentioned his surprise
    at the extent of the Thukker Tribe fleet\u2019s actions: \u201CI\xB4ve read the
    news in last couple of days, so I thought they would come to get their fellow
    Matari, but that the attack was that huge... - even a titan was brought to the
    battlefield - I was shocked\u201D. The Minmatar pilot, Eran Mintor, had mixed
    feelings about CONCORD, but was very open about his opinion on the achievements
    of the Thukker Tribe Fleet: \u201CI'm very happy that my Minmitar brethren have
    united together - the freeing of slaves in the Derelik region is a major success\u201D.\n\nSome
    pilots were not quite so pleased with CONCORD\u2019s actions, with Himnos Altar
    having the view that the organisation had failed in its peacekeeper role: \u201CI
    mean, if they can't defend their headquarters, how are they supposed to be expected
    to keep the peace elsewhere? And besides, there was that whole Caldari invasion.
    Isn't their mandate to head that kind of thing off?\u201D. When asked further
    about the situation with Caldari Prime he was clearly angry: \u201CWhere was CONCORD
    then?!? - The Caldari are ugly, their ships may be powerful, but their invasion
    of sovereign space is too much. It is my hope that one day, we may drive [them]
    back...reclaim all the space that is rightfully the Gallente Federation's, and
    make sure that they take their bad table manners with them!\u201D.\n\nBrzhk, on
    the other hand, was pleased with the change of circumstances surrounding the Caldari
    Prime: \u201Cwell, that's probably a good thing for our citizens there, and it
    looks like it was a good move, as the Federation didn't really strike back\u201D"
