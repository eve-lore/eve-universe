    [Tenth Alliance Tournament coverage site](http://at.eve-ic.net/10/) officially

    four teams face off today as the first round of qualifying begins. Teams will
    have a tough go of it as they try to field a combination for qualifying that will
    give them a win without showing the universe the tactics and formations they plan
    on using deeper into the tournament\n\nRounding out the \"Empire Collection\"
    of prize ships are the Caldari State's contributions this year; the Etana and
    the Cambion. The Etana is a modified Osprey cruiser boasting the ability to equip
    a covert ops cloak and includes some nice bonuses to skilled pilots. The Cambion
    is based off the Merlin frigate and is billed as a \"fiery rocket brawler with
    mad overheating bonuses.\"\n\nAs always, Interstellar Correspondents will be there
    to provide you with [written match reports and tasty statistics](http://at.eve-ic.net/10/).\n\nOur
    coverage continues to evolve and this year we are excited to provide our quick
    and accurate statistics to the EVE TV live stream.\n\nOur on-scene reporters will
    be working feverishly to provide written combat reports of each match. We really
    want to hear what you tournament participants have to say, so stick around a bit
    and have your say \"on the record!\"\n\nCome take a look at our beautiful, [information
    rich site](http://at.eve-ic.net/10/) and get ready for the kick off this afternoon
    with Agony Empire facing Exiled Ones at 15:00 New Eden time!\n\n[ ](https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=118533)\n\n*
