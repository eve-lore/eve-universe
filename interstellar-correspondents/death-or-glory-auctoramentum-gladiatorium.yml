- body: "**Taking The Oath** \\- Later this month a unique event will take place at
    a as yet undisclosed location. Auctoramentum Gladiatorium is a game where you
    are expected to fight, kill or die for money, glory and pleasure. These games
    are being sponsored by Revan Neferis, Sovereign of the Bloodveil which is part
    of the Sani Sabik faith. \n\nWe have been informed by the Sovereign that \u201Cthe
    games were taken from an ancient book inside the Apocryphon...this book describes
    how Sani Sabik holders used to entertain themselves with these sort of competitions.\u201D
    \n\nThe Sovereign went on to explain: \u201CBasically, a number of elite guests
    gathered to a hall to see humans fighting for honour, cash or simply the pleasure
    of mortal combats.\u201D These gladiatorial games hope to emulate these ancient
    and honourable traditions. \n\nThere will be two arenas in the games, in which
    there will take place two distinctly different methods of combat, one will consist
    of twelve combatants in faction cruisers who will take it in turns to fight until
    only one of them remains. The winner in this arena will get a faction battleship
    of their choice as a prize. \n\nThe second arena is an indoor arena where the
    gladiators will \u201C...fight according to the ancient ways...body [against]
    body\u201D, this arena will have a panel of judges who will declare the winner,
    the prize for the most impressive fighter will be one billion ISK. \n\nWhilst
    speaking with the Sovereign concerning these games, we asked her why she was reviving
    such an ancient tradition. \n\n\u201CThey represent the strength and power of
    the Sani Sabik faith under Bloodveil. It is a proven fact that not even loyalists
    of Empires can or have done an event [of such importance].\u201D As you can see
    the Sovereign sees the games as a show of the power of the Sani Sabik. \n\nWhen
    asked if these games were to be a one-off or a regular event the Sovereign stated:
    \u201CThis is the first time. But if it succeeds I'll make it as an annual ritualistic
    game for Sani Sabik faith. And I'll double the prizes each year.\u201D So if all
    goes well the combatants could be competing for two billion ISK during the next
    contest. \n\nThere will be 25 guests invited to watch the events of which 10 have
    already been chosen. Each of the guests will be supplied with an \u201CAshimmus\u201D,
    so that they may travel in style. The guest list is currently unknown but is sure
    to contain some of the most important people within New Eden. \n\nAs always the
    Interstellar Correspondents will be there to get you the news as it happens. \n\n*
