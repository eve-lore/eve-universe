- body: "**TENERIFIS** \\- On Friday 22nd June 109, Band of Brothers (BoB) lost one
    of their Titan class vessels to a co-ordinated assault by Goonswarm and Red Alliance
    pilots in the 46DP-0 system. \n\nThe behemoth ship, named \u2018Darwin's Contraption\u2019
    was set upon by numerous smaller ships, along with capital class vessels. Despite
    holding out initially, the damage provided by the dreadnought-class ships present
    was enough to breach the hull, ejecting the pilot, Shrike, and crippling the vessel
    beyond repair. The wreck was subsequently looted and extensively salvaged for
    components. \n\nFleet Commander and Goonswarm CEO Sesfan Qu'lah retold how his
    forces and those of his allies were able to trap Shrike and swiftly destroy the
    Titan: \u201CShe [Shrike] warped to a group I was leading on the 9-9 gate in 46DP
    system then doomsdayed and cloaked.\u201D \n\nThe Doomsday Device (Often shortened
    to \"D3\" or \"DDD\") is an impressive high powered weapon that the Titan can
    emit in all directions, causing severe damage to ships caught in its wake. It
    is capable of completely destroying smaller ships in its blast radius, although
    it can be resisted by utilizing shield or armour modules. \n\nIn this instance,
    Sesfan Qu'lah and his forces were able to evade the worst of the blast by warping
    away from the gate, Shrike then activated a cloaking device to hide the Titan
    from sensors. \n\nSesfan continued his explanation: \u201COne of my interceptor
    pilots then decloaked him 100km off the gate, and we had four interdictor bubbles
    down on her within a few seconds...we then cynoed in our capitals that were waiting
    and she died.\u201D In conclusion Sesfan praised recent advances in interdictor
    technology that allow interdictor bubbles to prevent super-capital jump drives
    from operating within their radius. \n\nShrike countered that the loss was not
    a morale or financial blow to Band of Brothers, stating: \"We have three more,
    and the ship was built to die, as all our ships are.\u201D When pressed if their
    forces would still include super-capital class ships in front line engagements,
    she added: \u201CWe don't build ships to look at them; we build ships to use them.\u201D
    The Titan pilot added that BoB forces were expecting an attack, but ran into some
    timing issues with a nearby Red Alliance operation to defend a reinforced star
    base. Band of Brothers were only fielding around 40 ships in the 46DP-0 system
    when the attack occurred, with numbers peaking at 250 during the battle. \n\nWith
    Darwin's Contraption destroyed, there have even been some pilots, and planet-bound
    citizens taking their credits to betting syndicates to place money on which of
    New Eden's elite group of Titan pilots will be next to lose their prize ships.
    \n\nShrike declined to make any final statement, instead stating \"I'll keep those
    last words, people will have to find out themselves the hard way\". Sesfan Qu'lah
    has called for the location to be host to a monument, presumably to mark their
    victory, although this would also serve as a memorial to those crew members who
    lost their lives serving on board Darwin's Contraption."
