    \ by ISD Tedra Kerrigan\n\n**Amarr, Throne Worlds** \\- Last year, a remarkable
    thing happened in New Eden. A capsuleer began going around giving random strangers
    things they needed.\n\nIt wasn 't a scam.\n\nIt wasn't a trick.\n\nIt was the
    Angel Project, brainchild of Sindel Pellion, a member of TEST Alliance Please
    Ignore.\n\nAfter reading dozens of threads on scamming and the respect it garnered,
    Ms. Pellion decided that while \"scamming may be a part of life in New Eden, it
    isn't part of MY life.\"\n\nSo she started the Angel Project. The premise is fairly
    simple, in that any capsuleer with ISK, modules or ships to spare sends them to
    The Angel Project who, together with Ms. Pellion, redistributes the items and
    ISK to needy capsuleers.\n\nThe project was initially met with disbelief, especially
    by younger capsuleers who couldn't believe that random strangers were really giving
    away expensive ships, modules and ISK for no reason. To be fair to those capsuleers,
    history has shown that in New Eden; if it looks free, it's probably a scam.\n\nDespite
    what cynical capsuleers may feel, Ms. Pellion appears to be running a legitimate
    charity operation dedicated to getting ISK and items to the capsuleers who need
    it most.\n\nFuture plans of the Angel Project include a sponsored roam for Brave
    Newbies, an upcoming charity auction and a currently-ongoing charity drive to
    raise extra funds for the Project.\n\n###  GalNet References\n\n[Sindel's Angel
