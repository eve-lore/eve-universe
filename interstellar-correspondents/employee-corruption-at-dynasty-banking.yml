    corruption to its troubles, after an employee was discovered offering to sell
    access to DBANK's sensitive data.  \n  \nIn the last few days, a Dynasty Banking
    employee has contacted Interstellar Correspondents attempting to sell sensitive
    data, including inside information and internal bank communications.  \n  \nWhile
    \"insider trading\" practices are common in New Eden's commodities markets, the
    fact that Dynasty Banking's internal communications are already for sale might
    indicate that discontent might be growing among the bank's staff.  \n  \nAsked
    to express her opinion on Dynasty Banking's alleged leak, EBank's \"interim CEO\"
    Athre told us that financial institutions must be vigilant regarding their data
    and points out that it takes a lot of work to prevent leaks, as they are hard
    to find and correct.  \n  \nAthre was also surprised to discover DBANK's private
    information already for sale: \"From the outside it appears information was very
    limited even to employees. [however] It is possible that an employee took that
    a sign of lack of faith or disrespect.\"  \n  \nWhile Dynasty Banking's crisis
    unfolds, customers are growing more and more skeptical about recovering their
    ISK.  \n  \nBank customer Glyn Davish was one of those that sensed something was
    amiss: \"I should have known something wasn't right when the delay between withdrawal
    requests and the ISK hitting my wallet was taking longer than usual\", he says.
    \ \n  \nDBANK officers have been contacted for information, but have not responded
    to any enquiries.  \n  \nInterstellar Correspondents will continue monitoring
    the situation and will report as soon as new information is made available.\n\n**[An
    earlier version of this article stated that we had been approached by someone
    selling the bank's database. This is a mistake on our part for which we apologise.
    We have been offered \"inside information, including private employee posts on
    the DBANK forums\". Our apologies for any confusion that may have been caused.]**\n\n*
