    The Forge** \\- One of the oldest surviving publically-owned enterprises in New
    Eden, BIG Merchant Bank [BMBE] recently celebrated its fifth birthday.   \n  \nThe
    BIG Merchant Bank is part of the BIG family of services run by Tornsoul. BIG is
    perhaps most famous for the BIG Lottery, but over the years a number of services
    have arisen based on BIG's reputation for honesty and reliability.   \n  \nDespite
    occasional setbacks and an attempt at an outright takeover by Eefrit from EVE
    Financial Services four years ago, Tornsoul has managed to keep control of one
    of the largest companies in New Eden, and even show a profit.   \n  \nAccording
    to CEO Tornsoul, there was some doubt when she first came up with the idea, but
    it soon caught on and there are now a number of competitors, though many others
    have closed up shop following internal thefts and embezzlement.   \n  \nAfter
    five successful years of operation, BIG Merchant Bank of EVE remains in business,
    offering large-scale ISK loans with interest rates of 1 - 2% a week on secured
    collateral. \n\n### GalNet Resources\n\n[BIG Corporation Evelopedia Entry](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/BIG_\\(Player_corporation\\))
