- body: "Tonight saw the opening of the first round of qualifiers for the COLOSSUS
    race. 18 brave contestants attempted to qualify for the Lai Dai Corporation, with
    pilots Morkt Drakt of Lai Dai and Feral of Drink Starsi\u2122 finishing first
    and second, respectively, to take their spots in the final ten-man Lai Dai team.
    \  \n  \nThe race's route took contestants through the dangerous, lawless expanses
    of the Orpana constellation through to contested areas of the Venal region. Unsurprisingly,
    most of the pilots encountered some unfriendly fire along the way, though most
    appear to have survived the race.   \n  \nAfter an exhilarating 20 jumps Morkt
    Drakt came in first, with Feral a very close second. Moments after they finished,
    Hitzu'Kai Brena, COLOSSUS correspondent, managed to track the two down for a brief
    word:   \n  \n**Hitzu'kai Brena:** Good day, Citizen!   \n**Feral:** Good evening.
    \  \n  \n**Hitzu'kai Brena:** Good evening, Mr. Drakt.   \n**Morkt Drakt:** Hello.
    Nice event.   \n  \n**Hitzu'kai Brena:** So, how does it feel to be winners?   \n**Morkt
    Drakt:** Quite surprised. In the heat of things, it's hard to keep track of who
    is in the lead.   \n**Feral:** Surprising... I saw a number of ships at the destination
    and initially thought I was 4th.   \n  \n**Hitzu'kai Brena:** So, Morkt, you're
    the winner, Feral, you're in second place. How do you feel your ships behaved,
    and will you be making any alterations to them for the final?   \n**Feral:** My
    ship behaved admirably, although I feel there is room for improvement in the autopilot
    coding. As for alterations... we'll see.   \n**Morkt Drakt:** The agility implant
    payed off, I guess, and I am going to stick with my setup because I realised a
    key point with the route, and that won me first place.   \n  \n**Hitzu'kai Brena:**
    What would you say was the key to your success? Was it a balanced ship setup,
    pure luck or something else?   \n**Morkt Drakt:** As I said, certain systems favoured
    my setup, and hopefully there will be more than a couple of systems like that
    in the final race.   \n**Feral:** I believe it was my knowledge of my ship's performance
    and abilities. At one point i was running at least 6th, and one of the people
    ahead of me had a virtually identical setup.   \n  \n**Hitzu'kai Brena:** Excellent!
    Well done, gentlemen - a deserved victory.   \n  \nTomorrow's qualifier, for the
    Wiyrkomi Corporation's team, kicks off at 19:00 EVT."
