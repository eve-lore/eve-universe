    announced the resignation of it's founding CEO, Ragnar. In the same breath, the
    new CEO of TTI, Gunny P, proclaimed a cease-fire with the New Venal Alliance.
    Gunny P furthermore vowed \"TTI has never condoned piracy, we have in the past
    been members of alliances which have included pirate corporations. This is no
    longer the case, nor will it ever be in future.\"  \n  \nThe two factions of Venal,
    the NVA and the Northern Alliance ( of which TTI was a part ) have been warring
    over the Venal region for five weeks. This announcement could mark the end of
    the Northern Alliance, and the end of the war.  \n  \nThe NVA, taken somewhat
    by surprise by these announcements, has not had time to formally respond. However,
    in an informal interview with one of their spokespeople, it became apparent that
    the NVA does not consider their troubles to be over. There are still concerns
    over pirate activity in Venal and it's border region, Pureblind. NVA representatives
    intend to formalize whatever agreements and policies are needed at their next
    council meeting, which should convene in the next few days.  \n  \nStill, this
    is a hopeful development, in that the Venal and Pureblind area may soon become
    open to free enterprise. At present, however, the NVA's travel advisory remains
    in effect. Hostilities and open combat are expected to continue for some time,
    as the Venal security forces battle pirates and other undesirables in their newly
    claimed territories."
