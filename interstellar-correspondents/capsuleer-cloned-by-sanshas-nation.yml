    \u2013 A week ago, another Sansha wormhole appeared in the Rasile system where
    capsuleers battled and defeated a Sansha Revenant piloted by Slave Tedra01, a
    name also recognised as an Interstellar Correspondent reporter.   \n  \n[![Tedra

    In the week prior, ISD Tedra Kerrigan gained access to a private facility in the
    Stain region. There, she was allowed an exclusive one-on-one interview with Sansha
    Kuvakei to discuss the increased Sansha activity within New Eden. There is now
    evidence suggesting that before her return, she was cloned and her memory wiped.
    \  \n  \nUpon hearing the news of the battle against her Sansha clone, ISD Tedra
    Kerrigan was shocked. She entered Rasile and gave visual confirmation of her own
    clone. It was at this time she received an anonymous letter containing the unaltered
    transcript of her interview with Sansha Kuvakei.   \n  \nDuring the battle, Slave
    Tedra01's devoted cries \"for Nation\", were met equally by capsuleer's calls
    \"for freedom\". This abduction seems to be yet another case of civilians and
    capsuleers being drawn, unwillingly or unknowingly, into Sansha's ranks.\n\n###
