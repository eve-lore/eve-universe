    \u200BKW-OAM, Tenerifis** \\- The alliance Split Infinity. [S1.] has been successful
    in capturing its first system.   \n  \nS1. is an alliance of about 250 capsuleers
    that recently captured sovereignty for the first time. The alliance is lead by
    SI Radio, which is well known and has been broadcasting to capsuleers since the
    year 107.   \n  \nS1. was previously not a major force in outlaw space, as they
    chose to reside primarily in class 6 wormhole space. When asked about why he decided
    to push his alliance to take sovereignty, Quivering Palm, CEO of SI Radio, stated:
    \"We felt that gaining our own [sovereignty] would be the next logical step. It
    was quite challenging to get everyone organised and the logistics were... different
    than anything else we have [previously] done.\"   \n  \nErrik Thrakkar, Primary
    Diplomat for SI Radio, revealed that throughout the entire operation, \"80 or
    so [pilots were involved], including the unsung logistics heroes.\" He also remarked
    that the decision to take sovereignty was not one that was made overnight: \"[We've
    been planning this] since late last year, perhaps November or so.\" He finished
    up by saying that the alliance's immediate plans were to settle into their new
    home in outlaw space and enjoy all that it has to offer. \n\n### GalNet References\n\n[DotLan
