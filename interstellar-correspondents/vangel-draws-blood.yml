    **Aurohunen** - The Alliance Tournament IX commissioned prize ship, the Vangel,
    has drawn first blood in solo combat. Shiroi Okami, a renowned pilot, thrill seeker
    and proud owner of this Vangel, says that since entering AT9 he \"promised [himself
    he] would use it in solo PVP.\"  \n  \nAs thrilling as it is to hunt other pilots,
    doing so in a \"35 billion ISK ship just makes the heart race that much faster.\"
    Shiroi admits however, that \"I actually got a little cocky with it, the Myrmidon
    I fought put up an extraordinary fight.\"  \n  \nBecbop, the victim, was belt
    baiting when he \"saw a shipclass on scan that [he] hadn't seen before.\" The
    Vangel landed 20km off from his Myrmidon and after a short moment of sizing each
    other up, they moved against one another. Becbop admits his Myrmidon was outclassed
    as Shiroi was able to kite him outside of blaster optimal range. Despite his loss,
    he was \"really happy that the ship was used in combat. Shiroi has real guts to
    use that ship in combat and I wish him the best.\"  \n  \nShiroi plans to post
    a video account of the battle in the near future.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Discussion
