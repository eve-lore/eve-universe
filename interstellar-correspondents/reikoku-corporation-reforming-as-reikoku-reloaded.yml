    but are transferring to a new name and ticker, Reikoku Reloaded [RKZ.R].\n\nRumours
    began at the end of last month when Menta Fox of PuPPet MasTers asked on the Corporation,
    Alliance and Organization Discussion board of GalNet what was happening with the
    sudden drop in Reikoku's staffing list. Membership has dropped from over 600 to
    220 in a matter of days.\n\nSFShootme's initial response was that RKK members
    could wind up in a new corporation formed with members of Destructive Influence,
    to be called Relentless Influence [RiCE]. LadyScarlet of Destructive Influence
    even [displayed a banner](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fimg49.imageshack.us%2Fimg49%2F4623%2Frice.jpg)
    which she claimed was supposed to be their official picture.\n\nPerpello, the
    source of the claim, stated:\n\n\"Reikoku is not disbanding nor are the rumours
    of a merger with another corporation true. But we are re-forming into a new corporation.
    As for the reasons, it will all become clear in the due course of time and I will
    not comment any further.\"\n\nThe listed description of Reikoku Reloaded is \"Thank
    god I can now fix the shares problem!\"\n\nIn November 109, one million Reikoku
    shares were placed on sale to the public by an unnamed individual using Verone
    of Veto Corp as an intermediary.\n\nThe mystery seller was suspected at the time
    to be Lion el'Johnson, who had been a director of Reikoku, left it while in possession
    of 1 million RKK shares and later went on to join Veto.\n\nAt the time, Reikoku
    CEO Dianabolic stated an intent to transfer the corporation's assets and employees
    into a new CONCORD-registered corporate entity. Such a transfer never happened,
    however, until - possibly - now.\n\n[](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.eveonline.com%2Fwiki%2FShares)\n\nReikoku's
    blueprint holdings and their locations became widespread knowledge as a result
    of the share sales.\n\nBy moving members and assets into a newly-registered corporation,
    Reikoku could possibly restore a measure of corporate secrecy, but any towers
    anchored for RKK will remain the property of Reikoku, not Reikoku Reloaded, unless
    taken down and put up again by a member of RKK.R.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[RKK
