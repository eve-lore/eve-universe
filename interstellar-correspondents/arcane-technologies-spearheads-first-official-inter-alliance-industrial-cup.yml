- body: "Within weeks of Concord recognising the outer rim alliances as sovereign
    nation-states, Arcane Technologies (ATUK) has organised their first official tournament.
    In a press release earlier this week, ATUK representative Stan Hyd announced a
    championship with a difference, the first Inter-Alliance Industrial Cup.   \n
    \ \nTeams of eight pilots from all of the alliances will be allowed to compete
    against each other in a loadout-unrestricted, anything-goes battle, the only catch
    being that industrial ships are the only class allowed to compete.   \n  \nThe
    competition is to take place on the 9th of January in the notorious system of
    PF-346. Pilots' teams will start approximately 30 kilometres apart, after which
    all will come down to their tactics and loadouts.   \n  \nThe unusual nature of
    this event has sparked interest from all over the universe. Citizens who have
    become bored with the other \u201Cextreme\u201D sports, such as Mind Clash and
    the deadly combat ship fights see this as a sport with great potential. One sports
    critic was very excited, saying, _\u201CIndustrials aren\u2019t often used in
    combat. I can see each battle getting more interesting as the experimentation
    with setups becomes more refined.\u201D_.   \n  \nIndustrial ships have, however,
    shown they are more than capable of defending themselves. In an amazing twist
    of events a few months ago, one pilot successfully managed to track down and destroy
    an interceptor in nothing more than a Bestower. The actions of that pilot were
    almost universally congratulated.   \n  \nThe alliances recognised and thus allowed
    to compete are: Curse Alliance  \nBoB  \nFountain Alliance  \nFirmus Ixion  \nStain
    Empire  \nThe Phoenix Alliance  \nNorthern Star Alliance  \nFade Union  \nNew
    Outer Ring Allied Democracy  \nXetic Federation  \nThe Pirate Syndicate  \nCuratores
    Veritatis Alliance  \nForsaken Empire  \nJQA Alliance  \nUshra'Khan  \n3rd Front
    alliance  \n  \n  \nIf a team still wants to enter, but are not part of those
    alliances, they can contact Stizum Hilidii to see if an arrangement can be made.
    Any corporations wishing to sponsor the event should take the same route.   \n
    \ \nApplications for entry should be made via eve-mail to Stan Hyd, detailing
    which pilots are on their team. Closing date for entries is the 2nd of January.
    \  \nWe at the ISD-IC would like to wish any participants good luck and good fun!"
