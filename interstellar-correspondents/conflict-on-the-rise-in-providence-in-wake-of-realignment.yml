    day 4 of ATXIV got underway, reports started flowing in that a hostile fleet had
    entered Providence. In JEIV-E, Provibloc ships clashed with the primarily Triumvirate.[Tri.]
    and League of Unaligned Master Pilots [Lumpy] fleet. The invaders, numbering just
    over 200 sub-capital ships, faced off with a force of over 300 Provibloc ships
    led by CVA, Yulai Federation, and Sev3rance. In what appears to be an attempt
    to destroy a second Citadel within Providence in 4 days, the fleet was met at
    the XHQ gate. Tri. Macharials and Lumpy Tengu's ran into Provi capitals and a
    heavy Maelstrom/Nightmare fleet and when the dust had settled, nearly half of
    the attacking fleet had been destroyed.\n\nPreliminary battle reports showed that,
    60 Macharials had been lost, while Lumpy's Tengu's fleet fared much better, escaping
    with only one loss. The defending fleet, at the time of writing, had lost 20 Stealth
    Bombers, 17 battleships, and 11 Logi. While roughly the same number of ships were
    lost by both sides, the value of the Tri. & Co. losses topped 30 billion, while
    the Provi fleet lost approximately 13 billion. \n\nIn the days leading up to this,
    a Fortizar owned by Sev3rance was destroyed by a Tri. Macharial fleet in B-WPLZ.
    \n\nThis recent aggression, combined with the recent departure of The Volition
    Cult [VOLT] from the coalition within Providence known as Provibloc has led to
    speculation that a larger scale invasion could be in the works. VOLT recently
    changed their aggression policy from the Providence standard of NRDS [Not Red,
    Don't Shoot], to a much more aggressive NBSI [Not Blue, Shoot It]. VOLT has also
    run afoul of the CVA ratings system and has been set KOS [Kill on Sight] due to
    aggression by some of their pilots within the Providence Region. While it appears
    that VOLT is not in league with Tri., many are left wondering.\n\nFuriousPig,
    CEO Emeritus of Sev3rance [-7-], seems pretty confident as he states, \"Volt wanted
    to spread their wings & come out of the perceived CVA shadow.  And Tri are down
    to flex their muscles.\"\n\nThis appears to be confirmed by Garst Tyrell, Executor
    of Tri. as he shrugs off the rumors of a larger conflict in Providence, stating
    that the reason for being there is \"Just fun\" and what their plans are for the
    future, \"We're staying in Provi for now and will flex to wherever needed in the
    coming months based on political developments.\"\n\nCVA Diplomat xHjfx echoes
    the sentiment; \"[Tri. are] A formidable foe but the impression is that it's a
    phase rather than a determined assault.\"\n\nWhatever the truth is, the temperature
    is heating up in Providence and only time will tell how this evolves.\n\nBattle
