    of the Wiyrkomi Corporation's Final team are on the score card: Trooper B99 of
    the Zoners and Jeffrey Lebowski of Imperial Dreams.   \n  \nSpanning 34 jumps
    and ending up deep in the bowels of the Catch region, tonight's race saw the two
    winners go toe-to-toe for much of its duration, leaving most of the other contenders
    in the dust. At the qualifier\u2019s halfway mark, as the route veered off into
    HED-GP, the racers were confronted with a Shinra blockade. Details are sketchy
    at time of going to press, but unconfirmed reports state that some contestants
    may have been shot down and pod-killed by the Curse Alliance corporation. More
    details on that as the information is confirmed.   \n  \nRace organizer Utaro
    Ziilikam had a few words with the two winners after the race:   \n  \n**Utaro
    Ziilikam:** Congratulations to both of you on qualifying for the finale. Do you
    have any words you wish to say to the press?   \n  \n**Trooper B99:** Jeff, after
    you, lad.  \n**Jeffrey Lebowski:** I\u2019ll just say it was an honour flying
    in this race, and I hope I will do even better in the Finals. For Wiyrkomi! Trooper,
    all yours.  \n**Trooper B99:** I\u2019d like to thank the honourable Wiyrkomi
    Corp for allowing me to fly, my employer, and of course Zoners and the lads of
    CA. And last but not least, my gallant competitors. You were great!  \n**Jeffrey
    Lebowski:** Indeed they were. Thanks, guys.  \n**Trooper B99:** Aye \u2013 and,
    of course, my new team mate, Jeff. I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to have a blast.
    \ \n  \n**Utaro Ziilikam:** That\u2019s great \u2013 Congratulations once more,
    guys.  \n  \nTomorrow\u2019s highly anticipated qualifier, the first of five for
    the Kaalakiota Corporation, begins at 22:00 EVT."
