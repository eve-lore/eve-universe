    \ \n  \nIn the brief press statement, LadyOfWrath and Selene D'Celeste confirmed
    that EVE-Trade's stock exchange will be available within Eve Central Reserve's
    portal site.  \n  \nHowever, eager investors who were waiting to use EVE-Trade's
    stock service will have to wait another week.  \n  \nAccording to Selene D'Celeste
    of Eve Central Reserve, the bank's 'open beta' phase due to launch this weekend
    has been postponed to allow integration of EVE-Trade's functionalities.  \n  \n\"We
    were both about to launch this weekend, but got to talking, and we came to an
    agreement where EVE-Trade does not launch, LadyOfWrath comes onto our Board of
    Directors, and we develop a single exchange,\" explained Selene D'Celeste.  \n
    \ \nLadyOfWrath confirmed that stock exchange will remain her primary concern
    while working with ECR: \"it is in the best interest of the exchange to be tied
    into a bank either directly or not. In this case [capsuleers] will be able to
    use funds deposited within the bank throughout the exchange, increasing the flexibility
    of the entire corporation.\"\n\n \n\n### GALNET resources\n\n[EVE-Trade - Eve
