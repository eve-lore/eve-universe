    5C-RPA** \\- Red Alliance's [RA] sovereign space has come under fire on several
    fronts. Capsuleers from Atlas, Veritas Immortalis, Cult of War, Aggression and
    Sc0rched Earth are now pushing inside southern Insmother while Ethereal Dawn and
    Intreprid Crossing are applying pressure from the north and the west. The 5C-RPA
    system in Insmother has already fallen under Atlas control, while fighting in
    Etherium Reach appears to be localized around RV-GA8, TP-RTO and surrounding systems.

    of Red Alliance explained _\"We have from 500 [to] 800 enemies in our systems
    in three different regions reinforcing our [starbases] every night ... [the] war
    will end in maybe two weeks if our enemies [keep pushing like this]\"._  \n  \nCzech
    Lion of Ethereal Dawn, believs Red Alliance may possibly retreat from Insmother
    and Scalding Pass to better reinforce their strongholds in Etherium Reach. _\"The
    R-6 constellation is ironically the best defended in RA space [at the moment]
    as they launched about 60+ large towers [there]. In order to do that, they stripped
    many towers in Insmother and Scalding Pass... This is a multifront war. Even if
    we cannot make progress in [Etherium Reach], our actions [will] help others to
    take more space from the south or west\"._  \n  \nDespite the difficult situation,
    morale among Red Alliance pilots seems to be high. BAPP explained that capsuleers
    have already moved their valuable assets to safety and are enjoying combat. DeTox
    MinRohim of The Initiative Alliance expressed the opinion that Red Alliance pilots
    were fielding a strong defence. _\"They spent the weekend jumping around like
    crazy between the three fronts ... [starbases were] put in reinforced, [repaired],
    saved...\"_  \n  \nThe political and tactical situations in Insmother are intricate,
    but Atlas capsuleers remain confident of a successful outcome for their campaign.
    When asked what such an outcome might be, however, Perman of Atlas was laconic:
    _\"[Our] final target is classified.\"_  \n  \nThe Interstellar Correspondents
    will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as the situation changes.\n\n*
