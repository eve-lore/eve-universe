    Providence** \\- On 19.04.112, Sylph Alliance closed down after losing sovereignty
    over all its systems in Catch and Providence in the war with Against ALL Authorities
    some months ago.   \n  \nCreated four years ago, Sylph Alliance at its peak numbered
    nearly 500 pilots among 20 corporations that controlled 17 solar systems with
    7 outposts.   \n  \nFormer Sylph communication officer, Souzen Yurama attributed
    the decline of the alliance to problems arising in the alliance after the Ushra'Khan
    attack, which Souzen considered as having \"the biggest impact on the corps [that
    left] from Sylph.\" After this attack, he claimed, the alliance had to raise internal
    taxes which lead to further corporations leaving. This left Sylph lacking in leadership
    and suffering dwindling numbers.   \n  \nDirtyFace, CEO of United States Army
    Corporation [USAA], which was formerly part of Libertas Fidelitas Alliance [LFA]
    before joining Sylph, explained that [\"LFA pushed into Against All Authorities
    [AAA] space trying to take [HED-GP]\"](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?article=3694)
    and identified this move as the source for all the problems within Sylph. \"With
    no leader, Sylph was left to burn.\" This situation led to USAA acceptance into
    Sylph. \"I came in and within a week everyone voted me in as new leader. Now I
    had an Empire.\" DirtyFace attributed his swift promotion to years of hard work
    earning the trust of the Providence Holders, but described the rulers of the region
    as \"[like] a teen kid - scared and not having a clue [about] what [they were]
    doing or should do.\"   \n  \nSouzen Yurama said that Sylph's fate became set
    when \"Klebitz (vice-president, 2nd officer in Sylph) accepted USAA without [discussing
    the matter] with other Sylph officers.\" USAA was in Sylph for eleven days, during
    which, according to Souzen, two other Corporations were accepted to the alliance
    in accordance with Klebitz's plan to increase member count.   \n  \nWithin those
    eleven days, USAA was elected executor and Souzen stated that Sylph became disorganized,
    dropping all sovereignty and losing all its outposts while the alliance worked
    on cleaning up its member list.   \n  \nDirtyFace thought the main problem in
    Sylph was something else: \"Greed... I tried to leave everything to one man and
    walk away but there were too many fights about how to run things and where to
    go. I had men loyal to me for over five years. The second I had to go, all my
    generals wanted the chair. So instead of having my name and corporation destroyed
    while I am gone, I gave it all away to the people.\"   \n  \nDirtyFace said that
    the final disbanding of Sylph and distribution of its assets was done by him personally
    as an act of charity, moving its assets to people that he felt were more responsible.
    This action caused CVA to set DirtyFace and his corporation \"Kill On Sight.\"
    DirtyFace stated \"Curatores Veritatis Alliance marked my men red for this. Now
    I am unable to fly in my own homeland. When [I return], and I will return, CVA
    will fall by my hand. I promise you that.\"   \n  \nFaced with an enemy offensive
    into their territory three months ago and burdened with internal conflicts and
    lack of leadership, the final demise of Sylph came last week when the DCO 2-7
    CAV Corporation left the alliance, allowing it to close after 4 years in operation.\n\n*
