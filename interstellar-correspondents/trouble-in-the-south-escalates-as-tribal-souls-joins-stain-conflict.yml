- body: "Paragon Soul - The Tribal Souls alliance announced their intent to join forces
    with Band of Brothers (BoB) and participate in their ongoing war with the Stain
    Alliance. The announcement places additional strain on the fragile political landscape
    of the war-torn southern regions and threatens to upset the tenuous relationship
    between the major alliances controlling the area. \n\nSylic from Tribal Souls
    explained that the primary reason for entering into the conflict was the stabilization
    of the south. He continued to say that after the Stain Empire vs. Stain- Alliance
    war and the conflict against Firmus Ixion; the news of Stain\u2019s war declaration
    against Band of Brothers was the \u201Cfinal straw\u201D for Tribal Souls. Sylic
    further told us that BoB had initially asked them not to become involved in the
    conflict, \u201Cwe were asked not to but took it amongst ourselves to get involved,
    we are neighbours and friends.\u201D He later added that Tribal Souls \u201Cwill
    stand behind the decisions we have made and that no one determines what we will
    and will not do.\u201D   \n  \nSylic doesn\u2019t foresee a quick end to the war
    because in his words \u201CSA are a stubborn and proud lot and will not let it
    drop.\u201D He went on to add that although he personally had the \u201Cwill to
    listen to options\u201D when they were presented, he was not solely responsible
    for the final decision making in Tribal Souls. Sylic also expects that the involvement
    of several alliances will make agreeing on any peace terms difficult as well.
    Regardless of this Sylic still maintains a positive outlook on the situation \u201CI
    see stronger friendships being formed amongst the alliances and the focus on the
    north versus south being the MAIN focal point, not petty squabbles and old wars
    renewed.\u201D \n\nOrc A of Stain- Alliance offers a different explanation on
    why Tribal Souls got actively involved with the war against Stain. \u201CIt is
    rather obvious and clear to us all that the reason behind the Tribal Souls act
    of treason is financial.\u201D Orc A reminds us that as a deep 0.0 space alliance,
    Tribal Souls relies on BoB and FIX for their trade routes to empire, because it
    was shorter than any route through Esoteria and Stain. \u201CIt would be no surprise
    to me at all if BoB secretly \u2018ordered\u2019 them to attack Stain, threatening
    them to revoke their travel rights.\u201D   \n  \nReacting to comments that Stain-
    Alliance was responsible for the destabilization of the south Orc A explained
    that the so called civil war with Stain Empire is an internal affair and didn\u2019t
    need to be discussed further. Orc A also denied responsibility for the war with
    Firmus Ixion: \u201CThey chose to revoke the standings and notified me personally
    about their decision, the information was brought up to the proper channels and
    it was decided to crush FIX and teach them a lesson.\u201D He explained that Stain-
    Alliance pilots operated with \u2018Not Blue Shoot It\u2019 rules of engagement
    where pilots without standings are seen as hostile targets. \u201CFor us, neutral
    standings equals war.\u201D   \n  \nWhen speaking of the conflict with BoB \u2013
    Orc A said that Stain did not want the war in the first place, because they had
    many friends in the ranks of Band of Brothers: \u201CMany people in nowadays hostile
    alliances are really friends behind the whole political scene, and sometimes politics
    break into those kinds of friendships, like we once had with BoB, Tribal souls,
    and FIX.\u201D He went on to comment that the internal miscommunications and \u201Cbloopers\u201D
    during diplomatic talks \u201Cled to an unpleasant situation involving threats
    and rude behaviour\u201D which made the war with BoB inevitable.   \n  \nGiving
    his opinions regarding the status of the conflict he mentioned that although the
    mood was hostile, nothing had really changed since Tribal Souls had entered the
    war. \u201CWe still control the Stain region perfectly and not BoB nor Tribal
    souls and not even Fix send any forces at all but small squads.\u201D Orc A shares
    the hope that the south will be at peace. Orc A: \u201CPersonally I hope that
    this madness will end soon. SA does want a Stable south, but in order to have
    a stable south that is acceptable for us, modifications must take place, such
    as a change of attitude of some of our neighbours. This war is a waste of time
    and ISK, ours and everyone's.\u201D"
