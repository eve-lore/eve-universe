    \ by ISD Angelus Faust\n\nOver the past few years lotteries have gradually become
    increasingly popular throughout New Eden. Recently, however, the industry has
    exploded with an estimated 50,000 pilots partaking in lotteries such as SOMERblink,
    Ships of EVE, and BIG Lottery. Almost every lottery has its own set of rules and
    characteristics; pilots should familiarise themselves with how a particular lottery
    works before gambling.\n\nSome of the first lotteries to dot New Eden began on
    the CONCORD pilot messaging boards. Ships of EVE was one of such lotteries, with
    prizes ranging from a single faction battleship to portfolios of hundreds of ships.
    Many similar lotteries, often run by individual pilots, still dot the messaging
    boards to this day.\n\nBIG Lottery, another \"traditional\" lottery, operates
    almost identically. Pilots can buy tickets for 1 thousand ISK, which are then
    entered into weekly drawing for prizes of up to 5 billion ISK.\n\nSOMERblink,
    on the other hand, operates quite differently. Pilots deposit ISK into an account,
    which can then be used to buy tickets for \"blinks.\" These are small drawings
    involving as few as 8 players that may only last for a few minutes. For pilots
    who still like the idea of larger prizes, there are \"gigablinks\" which are larger
    drawings involving many more pilots and offer prizes such as capital ships and
    titan skill books.\n\nWhile many pilots are drawn to the lotteries for the prizes,
    some simply do it for sport. One such pilot, Kaldor Mentat, remarked that it is
    just about taking part for him: It does not really matter that much if I win or
    lose, although winning something is of course always nice. \"He also offered advice
    to players looking to roll the dice for the first time: \"Never wager what you
    cannot afford to lose.\"\n\n###  GalNet References\n\n[BIG Lottery](http://biglottery.big-eve.com/BIG%20Lottery)\n\n[SOMERblink](http://cogdev.net/blink/)\n\n*
