    by the Ascendant Frontier Titan during a skirmish with Band of Brothers forces.
    \n\nWhile casualties were low, this is yet another landmark in the scale that
    capsuleer-driven politics and warfare are taking. \n\nWitnesses to the event mention
    a \"blinding white light\" that engulfs everything in sight, leaving nothing but
    scorched remains behind it. \n\nThe conflict between the two neighbours erupted
    shortly after BoB's [announcement that it had taken the path of war](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=401712)
    once again. \n\nWhile the target was not known at the time, it was not long before
    reports of scouts and raiding parties into ASCN territory surfaced on the Gal-Net
    channels, shortly followed by confirmation on both parts that war had erupted.
    \n\nWhen asked about the purpose of this war, BoB ranking officer Kryztal simply
    indicated that it was for glory and land, rhetorically asking \"what bigger goal
    is there [than] to destroy a Titan and gain more space?\" \n\nCommenting on the
    use of the Judgement device, she feels that \"[it] must have been a mistake\",
    since not only was the body count low, but included friendly-fire. \n\nOn the
    ASCN side, morale is high and confidence strong in these early stages, as confirmed
    by High Command Officer Gilbert Drillerson: \"Morale is very high in ASCN and
    we are looking at continued fighting with comfort and confidence.\" \n\nSpeaking
    about the current situation, he observed that \"until Capital ships are committed
    to assaulting Starbases, nothing has really changed\" and that the intensity of
    the coming battles will only increase. \n\nBoth observation and confidence were
    shared by Kryztal, who stated that \"[BoB] is in no hurry\" and that there was
    \"no doubt that we will be the ones standing victorious when [the war] ends.\"
    \n\nAn [ultimatum and an offer](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=402688)
    to the inhabitants of the GQ2S-8 system was made by BoB, which ASCN has promptly,
    but unofficially, dismissed. \n\nNeighbouring alliances have been following the
    events closely, and while some of them have stated their verbal support to one
    side or the other, few have taken the step of siding with one of the protagonists,
    the usual exception being the Axiom Empire, ASCN's unfaltering ally. \n\nPolitical
    analysts and other experts have since been studying this \"clash of the titans\"
    with a mix of interest and apprehension, as explained by Kep Ekatemi, political
    analyst at the University of Caille; \"Until now, Doomsday-class weapons only
    existed as rumours, but now they are very real and have already been used, which
    makes them much more palpable!\" \n\nFor him, the scale of the conflict \u2013
    opposing two of the largest Capsuleer alliances \u2013 added to the potential
    use of the heaviest Capital-class ships, has created an electric atmosphere and
    become the focus of all attention."
