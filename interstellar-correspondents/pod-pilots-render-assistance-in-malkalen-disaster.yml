    * *\n\nAlthough there was no official chain of command, Sylvain Lemieux appealed
    to the pod pilot community via GalNet and formed one of the larger groups of volunteers
    aiding in the efforts. The group, calling itself simply \u201CMalkalen Relief\u201D
    opened a communication channel and began operations immediately. Using every available
    freighter and industrial ship at hand, the group claims to have evacuated several
    thousand citizens from the area and brought in several thousand m3 of supplies.
    \n\nIn a show of compassion, Admiral Rodj Blake of Praetoria Imperialis Excubitoris
    suspended war activities with Electus Matari in the the system of Malkalen, and
    two stargate jumps out so that Electus Matari pilots could render assistance.
    \n\nAdmiral Blake did survey the scene, but chose not to join any of the relief
    groups, stating: _\u201CImpromptu aid efforts, no matter how well intentioned,
    can sometimes cause as much confusion as actual aid. We would not want to hinder
    trained agencies in their mission to save lives; therefore, we'll be keeping things
    low-key for now\u2026 I hope that the proper Caldari authorities will at some
    stage inform interested parties exactly what is required; that will give us a
    better idea of what to supply. In the meantime, know that we will stand shoulder
    to shoulder with our friends in the Caldari State.\u201D_\n\nSylvain Lemieux also
    waited hopefully for an official organization of efforts: _\u201CWe are a stopgap;
    once the official response kicks in our efforts should pale in comparison. We
    aren't trained for this sort of thing and the sooner the CEP step in the better.\u201D_\n\nSeveral
    hours into the volunteer relief efforts, Ishukone Corporation officially announced
    the formation of a disaster relief program. The call for specific supplies to
    be brought in has better focused the seemingly chaotic efforts of pod pilots.
    \n\nWith more help on the way, Sylvain was finally able to take a break and think
    about the day: _\u201DToday was a dark day and if some good could come of it,
    it has been that Caldari and Gallente, Matari and Amarr have worked shoulder to
    shoulder.\u201D_"
