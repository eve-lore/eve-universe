- body: "Last Friday evening saw forces from the Ushra\u2019Khan clash with elements
    of an Amarrian loyalist corporation named the 1st Praetorian Guard while transporting
    tens of thousands of slaves to freedom in the Minmatar Republic.   \n  \nAccording
    to Darmed Khan of the Ushra\u2019Khan, his organisation was carrying out a planned
    mission to evacuate approximately twenty seven thousand rescued slaves from locations
    within the Amarrian territories. Upon their arrival within Matari space, several
    thousand of these former slaves were to be inducted into the Jetunba re-education
    program \u2013 a Republic run program designed to prepare freed slaves for a new
    life.   \n  \nSpeaking in an interview Darmed Khan said: \u201CSeveral days ago
    I received notification from Republic Fleet official Egbilolf Gerg that the Jetunba
    re-education program was to open for new applications in Amamake this Sunday.\u201D
    \  \n  \n\u201CHe had managed to reserve for us 8100 places, which he desired
    for us to fill with rescued slaves\u201D   \n  \nKhan went on to explain that:
    \u201CWe were already planning a transport of rescued slaves from Amarr space
    to our own facilities in Gulmorogod, to be able to enter some of them in the Jetunba
    program was an offer we could not refuse.\u201D   \n  \nWhen questioned about
    Friday evening\u2019s events, Khan described how one of the transport convoys
    came under attack by a 1st Praetorian Guard taskforce during the return trip.
    He went on to explain that although the escorts fought bravely, they were regrettably
    unable to prevent the destruction of one transport vessel and the loss of three
    thousand lives onboard.   \n  \nRemarking that his own transport vessel was heavily
    damaged in the attack and was \u201Cbarely able to reach the gate\u201D, Darmed
    said: \u201CThe 1st Praetorian Guard had full warning that we were carrying many
    human lives, but showed no regard for their safety.\u201D   \n  \n\u201CI wish
    for everyone across the galaxy to know how reckless the 1st Praetorian Guard are
    when it comes to human life.\u201D Khan later went on to state that at present
    the Ushra\u2019Khan had no information as to how the Amarrian loyalists came to
    know about their transport operation, but future missions were planned.   \n  \nSpeaking
    in an interview on Saturday, Gazon of the 1st Praetorian Guard explained that
    the 1PG taskforce had been dispatched to investigate a tip-off about what described
    to him as \u201Cstolen Amarrian property being smuggled out of Empire space\u201D.
    \  \n  \nWhen recounting the previous night\u2019s events he explained that the
    tip-off proved to be correct and the taskforce had engaged the Ushra\u2019Khan
    \u2018smugglers\u2019 - going on to state that: \u201CThe escort of the Mastodon
    class Transport ship carrying the livestock was being destroyed or had fled, but
    the Mastodon managed to elude our grasp\u201D.   \n  \nThough the 1st Praetorian
    Guard suffered no losses in the initial engagement, an Omen class cruiser belonging
    to 1PG pilot Cratus was apparently destroyed during the pursuit of the transport.
    Gazon later explained that 1PG forces were stretched thin in an attempt to cover
    all escape routes in the Andabiar system, resulting in the escape of the remaining
    Ushra\u2019Khan convoy before reinforcements could arrive.   \n  \nHe went on:
    \u201CI'd like to state that the Ushra'Khan will have to pay for the theft of
    Amarrian property. They may have been lucky this time, but their luck will not
    last.\u201D   \n  \nWhen asked if the 1st Praetorian Guard planned to retaliate
    against the Ushra\u2019Khan, Gazon remarked: \u201CWe are pragmatists. We know
    that we will never find the slaves now that they have been taken to the cesspool
    the Minmatar call a Republic. So retaliation will not be possible. However, we
    will stay vigilant, and there will be strikes against U'K support lines.\u201D
    \  \n  \n\u201COur contacts are watching the Ushra'Khan. If they plan more operations
    of the kind mentioned or others, we will be there to hinder their every move.\u201D
    \  \n  \nGazon later went on to commend the actions of the taskforce, stating
    that: \u201CThe pilots of the Guard, who I had the honour to command, did perform
    outstandingly. They showed no fear when we were sure to be ambushed and fought
    like true Praetorians, grinding the enemy into the dust and shielding each other
    from the blows of the enemy.\u201D"
