    Attention capsuleers! It ''s that time of year again! The 5th annual New Years''
    Eve Celebration hosted by capsuleer Daggaroth is to be held on December 31 at
    23:00 EVE Time


    The event will take place at Umokka X, Moon 4, outside the Caldari Navy Testing
    Facilities. All capsuleers are invited to bring ships equipped with lasers, fireworks
    or missiles to light up the night around the station.


    Music will be provided by New Eden Radio, and there will be a raffle held again
    this year. This year''s prizes will include a Chimera carrier, as well as a carrier-of-choice,
    the latter to be built once the winner has decided which carrier he or she would
    like to receive.


    Last year''s event had roughly 900 capsuleers attending, and event organiser Daggaroth
    is hopeful that they can top the number this year.
