    Essence.**\n\nCommander A9, in cooperation with New Eden Radio will be hosting
    a celebration commemorating the Battle of Caldari Prime on 22 March.  \n  \nThe
    battle, believed to be one of the largest in the history of New Eden, took place
    on 22 March, YC115. In Commander A9 's words, the celebration will 'recognize
    and honor the soldiers, pilots and citizens from all empires who participated
    in Operation Highlander.' Operation Highlander was the Gallente-led mission to
    destroy the Leviathan Shiigeru positioned over Luminaire VII.  \n  \nOperation
    Highlander was the end result of months of tensions between the Gallente and Caldari
    empires over the deployment of the so-called 'clone soldiers' and the deployment
    of the Leviathan-class Titan Shiigeru in the skies above Luminaire VII. The battle
    began with a large capital ship fleet of Gallente ships, including capsuleer fleets
    from all reaches of New Eden. The battle culminated in the destruction of the
    Shiigeru and the entire Caldari defence fleet in the system.  \n  \nCommander
    A9, a veteran of the engagement, said in an interview that he considers the Battle
    of Caldari Prime one of the most climactic events in New Eden's history.  \n  \nDuring
    the event on this 22 March, capsuleers are invited to bring any light-emitting
    modules such as lasers, shield and armor transfers, target painters, fireworks
    and snowballs, to create a spectacular lightshow. Prizes for the best displays
    will include PLEX, a Megathron, a Rokh (and, separately, a paint scheme for a
    Rokh), Marines, firearms and 'orbital strike packages.'  \n  \nDJ Daggaroth and
    other DJs from New Eden Radio will be providing music, and DJ Daggaroth will be
    raffling off a Chimera during the course of the event.  \n  \nIn honor of the
    fallen, there will also be a special Missing Man formation executed.  \n  \nThe
    event will start at 17:00 ECT, in Luminaire, at the Operation Highlander beacon.
    \ \n  \nCommander A9 had the following to say about the events of last year: \"I
    remember the first time I saw the Shiigeru, the awe and fear I felt upon first
    seeing such a ship. I remember meeting pilots who would stage attacks on the Titan
    defense grid, while being amazed at their ability to survive. When I learned of
    the circumstances of the Titan's positioning over the planet, I resented its existence.
    I hated that it was holding the planet hostage, and I swore that one day, I would
    destroy it. On March 22, YC 115...I fulfilled my promise...and I lived to tell
    about it...so that everyone would learn, and remember, what happened here.\"  \n
    \ \nTL:DR - Event in Luminaire at 17:00 on the 22nd of March, bring lasers, fireworks
    and snowballs.\n\n###  GalNet References\n\n[Titan Destroyed!](http://community.eveonline.com/news/newsFromEve.asp?of=true&newsTitle=shiigeru-destroyed-federation-navy-offensive-in-luminaire-still-ongoing-1)\n\n[Youtube
