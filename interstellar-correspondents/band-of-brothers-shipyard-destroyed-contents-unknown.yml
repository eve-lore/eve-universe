- body: "The conflict that has gripped New Eden escalated to a previously unseen level
    today during a coalition assault on a Band of Brothers capital shipyard in F-TE1T.
    An unprecedented array of capital ships were present during the attack and the
    Coalition lost dozens in the successful effort to take down the structure. The
    aftermath proved to be a salvager\u2019s dream with a wasteland of wreckage left
    behind and both sides claiming victory. \n\nWhen the explosions cleared, BoB had
    lost their tower and capital yard, along with anything that may have been inside.
    In return, the coalition lost at least forty capital ships, with estimates ranging
    as high as fifty-five. Regardless of the final figures, it marks the largest number
    of capital ships destroyed in a single engagement in the history of New Eden.
    \  \nFrom all available evidence the pro-BoB forces suffered zero capital ship
    losses during the engagement. \n\nAt first The Coalition insisted that the capital
    shipyard contained a titan in production, which would have been lost in the destruction
    of the tower. If this is true, it is the second titan that the Coalition has destroyed
    in such a fashion. However, it would appear that now they are backing off these
    claims, showing the insidious nature of this conflict where claim and counterclaim
    are bandied about with reckless abandon by all parties, showing how imperative
    it is to win the PR battle as much as the actual one. \n\nNevvyn, a representative
    of Dusk and Dawn Alliance, acknowledges the substantial capital losses, but also
    made it very clear that \u201Cthe target was the POS, anything else was strictly
    secondary.\u201D According to him, significant losses were expected and prepared
    for. He refused to comment on The Coalition\u2019s next move, and when asked for
    a statement, replied that the actions in F-TE1T spoke loud enough. \n\nOn the
    subject of today\u2019s plans, Nevvyn was more forthcoming, saying: \u201CVery
    simply, both sides formed up well in advance, the target system of F-TE1T had
    been full of 150-200 hostile pod pilots since the early evening. Steps had been
    taken to prevent our entry into the system, although we had secured our entry
    well in advance.\u201D \n\nA single warp disruption field had been placed at the
    POS which upset The Coalition\u2019s idea for a rapid exit, Nevvyn explained:
    \u201CThe plan itself was simple, jump in, engage the pos, destroy it, and then
    get out. Hit and Run tactics if you wish. The first part of the plan went exactly
    as intended, thanks to the skill, dedication and professionalism of our pod pilots.
    However, it seems that there were technical difficulties with the jump gates leading
    into F-TE1T and also with the jump portal on Emily (The D2 Titan), despite our
    best efforts, when it came to the \"run\" part, we could not get our support into
    system.\u201D \n\nConcluding the outcome from The Coalition\u2019s point of view,
    Nevvyn was succinct: \u201CThe plan was executed well, the goal was achieved,
    the POS died. In the Capital Ship Assembly Array, we believe there was a Titan
    class ship building. As with everything, gaining intelligence about the opposition
    is not always an exact science, and it seems the opposition have taken appropriate
    steps to ensure that we cannot verify our claim.\u201D \n\nOn the other side of
    the conflict, Shrike, BoB Avatar pilot and close friend of SirMolle, remains confident
    saying: \u201CThe Coalition is now on its knees without a capital fleet. The train
    has hit a brick wall. They just rolled the dice, off the table in a wild gamble.
    I hope they think the gamble was worth it because now they don\u2019t have a backbone.\u201D
    \n\nTo give an idea of the scale of the engagement Shrike added: \u201CWe had
    about 2000 pilots involved tonight in various ops all over, all for the purpose
    of killing the capital fleet. And the capital fleet is dead.\u201D \n\nMeanwhile,
    the war continues on. Seleene, executor of the Mercenary Coalition (MC), also
    granted IC an interview after the battle. The MC has openly acknowledged that
    it is under contract from the Band of Brothers and is assisting them in the war
    effort, and dozens of MC ships were present in the area of F-TE1T during the fight.
    According to Seleene, MC\u2019s current focus is to combine forces with BoB allies
    in order to achieve \u2018short-term goals\u2019. She refused to go into details
    with regard to what these goals were. \n\nSumming up the battle, Seleene added
    an interesting point of view to events, saying: \u201CWhile it's true The Coalition
    succeeded in their goal tonight, no group can sustain those sort of losses over
    and over again simply to eliminate one target.\u201D \n\nSesfan Qu'lah of Goonfleet
    insisted: \u201C(Our) morale is absolutely fine, most of us didn't even get to
    fight and we want another chance. Titans are so powerful that nobody can afford
    _not_ to attack them while they're building.\u201D \n\nThe strike represents a
    huge gamble on the part of The Coalition, but with a very large potential payoff.
    As Sesfan indicated, his side could not ignore the opportunity although responding
    to claims the losses had derailed operations, Nevvyn stated: \u201CThe war is
    still very much growing, a very slow but relentless movement.\u201D \n\nIn the
    end, the deciding factor of the victor in the battle comes down to what was really
    building inside that tower\u2019s capital array. As of the writing of this article,
    there has been no definitive confirmation by any party of what, if anything, was
    inside. The capsuleer community is forced to wait for BoB to divulge that knowledge,
    and if sources prove accurate, the much-anticipated answer will be coming within
    the next few days from BoB\u2019s leadership. \n\nWhether or not this battle will
    prove to be a turning point, remains to be seen, it is, however, destined to go
    down as one of the most memorable in New Eden history."
