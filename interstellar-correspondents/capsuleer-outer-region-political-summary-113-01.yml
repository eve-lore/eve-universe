    continues to be the Fountain region, with pressure mounting on IT Alliance (IT).
    The key outpost system of 6VDT-H, which was IT's staging area in the region, was
    subject to an around-the-clock siege by the Deklein Coalition starting on the
    27th. The system fell four days later in the afternoon of the 31st, with TEST
    gaining sovereignty that evening. IT Alliance and its allies did not appear to
    undertake any large scale efforts to lift the siege of the system.  \n  \nMeanwhile,
    two member corporations of IT, FinFleet and x13, left the alliance citing disagreements
    with the leadership structure. The loss of the large number of supercapital vessels
    owned by these corporations is considered by many to be a heavy blow to the capacity
    of IT Alliance to project its power. The two corporations have since formed a
    new alliance together, Raiden., who have taken residence in the Detorid region.
    \ \n  \nThe mercenary alliance Pandemic Legion launched a new campaign, assaulting
    key objectives of the Deklein Coalition. Thus far, they have been successful in
    incapacitating several jump bridge links and attacking capital ship assembly arrays
    in the area. There is a great deal of speculation over the possibility that this
    campaign is being funded by IT Alliance, which considering the timing and nature
    of the attacks appears highly probable.  \n  \nIn the southeast, The Initiative
    has lost almost all of its territory after declaring its intention to withdraw
    from conquerable null sec, losing in excess of thirty stations in two weeks. This
    comes after a prolonged conflict with Against All Authorities, which started in
    September of last year. During this conflict, INIT and allies at one point successfully
    managed to push .-A-. from all of its nullsec holdings. However, this success
    did not last, with continued pressure from .-A-. and allies allowing them to slowly
    retake their territory.   \n  \nWhite Noise and Red Alliance have been seen to
    gain significant territorial holdings from this, gaining most of the stations
    within the Immensea and Tenerifis regions.  \n  \nIf you would like to discuss
