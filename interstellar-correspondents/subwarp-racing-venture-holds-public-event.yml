    \ \n  \nThe event organiser and founder of the Subwarp Racing Venture, Julius
    Rigel, spoke briefly about the \"new comers\" races: \"During the convention there
    will be a newcomers race, exclusive to pilots that have not participated in one
    of the season races before, it's free to participate, unrestricted as far as equipment
    goes, and there are a few prizes waiting at the finish line.\"  \n  \nIn addition
    to the planned events, Erik Finnegan states that the third monthly race of the
    \"Subwarp Racing Venture Season\" will also be held.  \n  \nJulius Rigel said
    he organised the event to help educate the public about subwarp racing; \"I hope
    participants at the convention will learn to appreciate that you can pilot your
    ship manually and that you don't need to rely on your autopilot all the time\"\n\n*
