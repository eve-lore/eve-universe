    The Citadel** \\- After Lottopalooza's establishment over one year, the lottery
    has given out prizes worth over 1 trillion ISK. To mark the occasion, the 7th
    lottery saw the top prize of a Nightmare battleship awarded to the winner.   \n
    \ \nKain Rehel, organiser of the non-profit Lottopalooza 7, explained how the
    lottery first began: \"Well back then the only lotteries around for capsuleers
    were from Darkness and Chribba types and I figured, 'hey i can do that'.\"   \n
    \ \nJoelCoen, a regular ticket holder for the lottery series, revealed why he
    enters time and time again: \"I\u2019ve come away with a whole host of shiny toys,
    the best of which was a Machariel.\"   \n  \nTo the fans of the lottery, Kain
    Rehel offered his thanks: \"I'm just grateful for all the support and ideas capsuleers
    have given me along the way. I couldn't have got to this point without them. I
    have some customers that are still around since day one, over one year ago, that\u2019s
    awesome!\"   \n  \nThe lottery's rules limited a capsuleer to only 25 tickets,
    with each ticket costing 1 million ISK. The total amount of tickets for the lottery
    was 7,300. The ticket numbers were allocated to capsuleers at random with a value
    of between 1 and 7,300.   \n  \nThe winner of the Nightmare, the top prize in
    the lottery, was capsuleer Cyruxx, who revealed his plans for his new ship: \"I
    lost one recently so I will probably refit it and head back to ratting with it.\"\n\n###
