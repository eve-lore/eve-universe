    team of 'independent' pilots who have volunteered to defend and strengthen the
    Federation, we remind the significant viewing audience of the Tournament that
    the Federation is still strong and still proudly championing our ideals of freedom
    and choice.\"  \n  \nTournament organizers confirmed that the Federal Defense
