    \\- One capsuleer has stated her intent to visit every solar system in New Eden,
    cataloging the journey as she goes.  \n  \nHitomi Baka, the CEO of Koala Coalation
    [KAYC], recently started the epic journey across the known galaxy. Says Baka,
    \"Well, I started hitting every region in [New Eden], then decided that it was
    too small a challenge, so I decided to go to every system as well.\"  \n  \nProof
    of this journey will be documented in the photos Baka plans to take at each step
    of her journey. \"I am taking a [Neocom Image] of each system as I jump into it,
    [then] naming them and sorting by regions.\" The journey is expected to take anywhere
    from three to six months if she keeps her current pace.  \n  \nBaka explains her
    motivation: \"Initially, it was just a passing fancy. When I thought more of it
    and began to plan, it made me think. [Lawless space] and people claiming territory
    stop a lot of [pilots] from exploring. I decided to not only be the only person
    to have been in every known system, but to show others that it's not as scary
    as they think.\"  \n  \nAlthough Interstellar Correspondents has heard of similar
    feats, none has involved a system by system journey. Early last year, DevilDogUSMC
    of H E L I C O N Alliance recorded a [successful circumnavigation](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=3032&tid=7)
    of the known galaxy. He survived the journey with his ship intact.  \n  \nBaka
    will travel the stars in a specially modified Tengu designed to dissuade attempts
    to hinder her progress. At the conclusion of her trip, she plans to auction off
    the Tengu used in the journey as a collector's item, the proceeds of which will
    be donated to EVE University.  \n  \nPilots interested in tracking Baka's progress
    can find her general whereabouts listed under her bio; her exact location will
    not be published for security reasons.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events
