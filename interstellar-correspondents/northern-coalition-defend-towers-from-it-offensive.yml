    [NC] successfully resisted attacks on their control towers in YZ-LQL and Serpentis

    \  \n  \nThe Northern Coalition. alliance, not to be confused with the Northern
    Coalition collective of alliances, including Morsus Mihi, RAZOR Alliance and others,
    recently began engaging the residents of Fountain. NC currently counts 849 members,
    worked with Ev0ke before their departure from Cloud Ring and now sometimes receives
    support from Goonswarm Federation, arch-enemy of IT alliance.   \n  \nIT Alliance
    is currently the largest single alliance in New Eden and have vital interests
    in Fountain, a region rich in natural resources. In recent days, IT opposition
    to NC's presence has increased substantially.   \n  \nLate on the 8th, an IT fleet
    estimated at 250 members engaged approximately 140 vessels from NC and their allies
    at an NC control tower belonging to Rionnag Alba in YZ-LQL. While each side inflicted
    over 3 billion ISK in damage to the other, IT withdrew shortly before midnight.
    \  \n  \nIT together with few allies then sent a medium-sized fleet including
    20 capital ships to kill 7 reinforced NC towers in Serpentis Prime. NC appearances
    and miscommunication in IT scattered their fleet, resulting in many of the subcapital
    and some capital ships being destroyed while a supercarrier managed to escape.
    \  \n  \nThe remaining dreadnoughts engaged an NC tower in siege mode, becomming
    immobile. Super Twinkey69 from DOOM., NC, mused that this was perhaps \"a valiant
    effort to destroy the tower.\" The incomming NC supercarrier fleet destoyed the
    dreadnoughts within minutes though.   \n  \nSuper Twinkey69 said that the outcome
    of the Serpentis Prime battle was surprising. He described the prevailing sentiment
    in his alliance before-hand as \"We will be lucky if we make it out of this.\"
    NC's intel had suggested that IT had 9 or more supercarriers and several titans
    ready, but these ships were not deployed to Serpentis Prime on the night in question.
    \  \n  \nNC defended their towers in YZ-LQL and Serpentis Prime successfully against
    IT's assault and all are repaired at the time of writing, preserving NC's foothold
    in the heart of Fountain and forcing IT to restart the arduous process of reinforcing
    towers if they wish to oust them.   \n  \nEfforts to contact representatives from
    IT Alliance for their perspective on these events have been unsuccessful so far.\n\n###
