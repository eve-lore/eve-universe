- body: "**Amarr -** The Sansha loyalist organisation Naqam has declared war on the
    longstanding Amarrian paramilitary group Praetoria Imperialis Excubitoris (PIE).
    The first few weeks of the conflict have seen only light skirmishes so far, with
    both sides avoiding heavy losses. \n\nIn a lively [press release](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=680500)
    designed to mock the age of many PIE members, CEO of Naqam Izzychan offered a
    \u201Cretirement plan\u201D and claimed that they were \u201Cpast their due date\u201D.
    Along with her remarks came what she described as an \u201Cawesome game lined
    up for all of us to play together.\u201D In this case a declaration of CONCORD-sanctioned
    warfare. \n\nWhen asked why he thought Naqam declared war on PIE, Admiral Rodj
    Blake said, \u201Cas supporters of Sansha they hate the Empire and all that it
    stands for.\u201D Referring to a failed diplomatic meeting that erupted into open
    conflict, he added: \u201COne only needs to remember the betrayal that took place
    when Doriam sent an emissary to meet them to understand that.\u201D \n\nBlake
    went on to say that \u201Cthe war is still in its early stages and is likely to
    continue for a while. Although our current focus is on assisting the 7th Fleet
    in the Bleak Lands, we shall defeat these Naqam upstarts.\u201D \n\nWhen asked
    to justify the war, IzzyChan pointed back to the time when all the empires joined
    forces to break up the Nation. She dismissed the small size of her corporation
    as an unimportant factor, hinting that there would soon be a bigger fleet that
    could \u201Cknock on PIE\u2019s door.\u201D She added, \u201Call I can say is,
    \u2018PIE we aren\u2019t done with you yet. We\u2019re still here. Sansharawr!\u201D
    \n\nThe conflict between the four great empires and the Sansha Nation dates back
    to the time of Sansha himself. He was a successful Caldari tycoon who carved out
    a large piece of space for himself and then set about the task of creating a utopian
    nation according to his own bold visions. At first he was very altruistic and
    attracted many people through his magnetic personality. \n\nAs time went by however,
    he sunk into madness and conducted what were considered by many to be cruel experiments.
    As his experiments became increasingly questionable, the four empires joined forces
    and attempted to destroy the Nation. The few that survived were scattered to the
    outer regions and became pirates and pillagers. \n\nSooplex, with Naqam, said
    of PIE, \u201CYou walk blind in the shadows, believing in false prophets from
    within a decadent society. Open your eyes and see the true path. Follow in our
    footsteps and leave your corrupted lives behind. The Nation is true. You are false.\u201D
    \n\nThis quote seems to represent the current attitude of the Nation, which to
    this day continues to seek more members so that it may return to the \u201Cglorious\u201D
    times of the past when they possessed both numbers and influence. In this case
    the Nation has been served by a high profile corporation which is active on Galnet
    as well as the spacelanes. Their methods have already been met with notable success,
    drawing out those with long-dormant sympathies for Sansha's vision and even subverting
    previously loyal Amarrians such as ex-PIE member Kostantin Mort. \n\nMany have
    been worried to see this recent rise of capsuleer-based loyalism to Sansha's vision.
    With their immense celebrity status and access to a Galnet network that has a
    planetary audience numbering in the millions at any given time, they are perhaps
    rightly concerned."
