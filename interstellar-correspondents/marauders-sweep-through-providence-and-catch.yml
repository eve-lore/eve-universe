- body: "Late yesterday evening at 10pm EVE standard time, a fleet of what have been
    described as \u2018Marauders\u2019 were reported to have been probing defences
    across the Providence and Catch regions.   \n  \nMilitary analysts have described
    the actions against pod pilots as \u2018more in line with probing techniques rather
    than that of true acts of piracy\u2019, Marauder attacks have been reported throughout
    the regions and a number of industrial ships have not reported in from their transport
    routes. The main sightings of these Marauders have been at both the R3-K7K and
    HED-GP star systems. These encounters have been described as more of a form of
    \u2018hit and run\u2019 than a sustained attack, with reports of a number of light
    causalities on both sides.   \n  \nThe identity of the Marauding forces remains
    a mystery, save for a confirmed membership of a number of training institutions
    throughout the major nations in the Galaxy. The reported bulk of the force has
    been identified as that of the Minmatar bloodlines, a matter that has not sat
    well with the already inflammatory nature of the relationship between two powers.
    \  \n  \nThe technologically advanced nature of Marauder vessels and weaponry
    has been highlighted as uncharacteristic when considering the majority of their
    corporate peers, a matter that leads away from the conclusion of an amateur attempt
    at piracy.   \n  \nFurther evaluation of used strategy has lead to a rather unsettling
    link with that of unknown pirate forces several months previously, with an utilisation
    of light strike methods and complete communication silence whilst on tactical
    manoeuvres. A link between these two sets of incidents can not be ruled out."
