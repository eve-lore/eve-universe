    \ \n_(Example image curtsey of[Luteros](http://www.luteros-eve.de/))_\n\nIn a
    communication passed to Interstellar Correspondents, Damien Shroud said that he
    \  jumped his Revenant to kill a TEST Naglfar and commented that he wasn't afraid
    to \"drop shiny things to fights\". Unfortunately, he was caught by \"at least
    5 hics\" shortly after landing in Erila.\n\nIn [a public post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4kgf3o/project_mayhem_revenant_down_to_test/d3ercyp),
    TEST pilot and FC Vily elaborated on the operation, which was set up to hunt [16-13]
    ships in the Erila area after the destruction of a TEST dreadnaught. The Naglfar
    used as bait was almost lost to a [16-13] Phoenix and Archon before Damien's Revenant
    jumped into system. The Naglfar lit a cyno and TEST reinforcements poured into
    Erila, destroying the [Archon](https://zkillboard.com/kill/54153034/), [Phoenix](https://zkillboard.com/kill/54153039/),
    and finally, [the Revenant](https://zkillboard.com/kill/54153050/).\n\n \n\n**Additional
