- body: "**The Spying Game** \\- Espionage is rampant across New Eden. Not only do
    the four empires conduct operations against each other, but corporations and alliances
    also spy on each other. In fact, some corporations and alliances exist primarily
    to spy on others and sell the intelligence. \n\nOne such alliance is W A S T E
    L A N D [WASTE]. WASTE is a mercenary alliance that engages in terrorism, intelligence,
    infiltration, and espionage. They claim that they have infiltrated many of the
    major alliances and thus can offer intelligence on many fronts. If they do not
    have a network in a corporation or alliance, and a customer needs information,
    they will infiltrate the new target for a price. \n\nGetting a spy to sit down
    and talk is not an easy thing to do, but we managed to convince NoMoreLies, one
    of the major players in WASTE, to speak with us about espionage in New Eden. He
    first described one of their recent operations in which they managed to get the
    passcodes for an alliance\u2019s station network and its jumpbridges. With this
    information they were able to destroy several stations and steal ships and other
    assets. \n\n\u201CCustomers,\u201D NoMoreLies said, \u201Cwant different kinds
    of information.\u201D Some just want to steal assets, while others just need intelligence
    on where certain people are located. Other types of information include \u201Cplanned
    operations, fleet make ups for tactical purposes and disinformation.\u201D On
    this last point NoMoreLies was unwilling to describe specific operations but he
    did confirm that WASTE controls double agents as well. \n\nWhen asked how long
    it takes a spy to gain the trust of corporations and alliances NoMoreLies said
    that sometimes it is very easy. Many new corporation/alliance members are given
    access to the private nets these organizations maintain and from those nets gain
    much of their intelligence early on. On the other hand, it may take months to
    gain the trust of other corporations/alliances that are more careful with their
    information. \n\nWASTE is unusually open about the types of operations they engage
    in and even advertise on [GalNet](\u201Dhttp://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=748358\")
    in an effort to gain customers. \n\nIn spite of the fact that spying is rampant
    across New Eden surprisingly little is invested in counter intelligence operations.
    Most corporations limit their counter intelligence operations to closely vetting
    those whom they allow to join their corporation. New pod pilots who want to join
    big corporations are especially viewed with suspicion. Surely more efforts than
    this will be needed to root out spies like WASTE."
