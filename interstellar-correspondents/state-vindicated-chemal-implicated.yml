    there are now implications of a far more scandalous situation than previously
    thought. In part two of an in-depth review, the Interstellar Correspondents will
    cover amongst other things, the recent actions of one Cras Evacone; a Gallente
    columnist who was pushing his own interpretation of events to the capsuleer community
    in Luminaire. \n\nLast Tuesday evening, almost at the same time as Varnen Maan
    was addressing the pilots of Perimeter, the columnist Cras Evacone was elaborating
    on recent events. In a typical show of the liberalism he is known for, Mr. Evacone
    was just as critical of his own people as the other involved parties, claiming
    that the recent actions of Chemal Tech, which allegedly involved the use of undercover
    agents, damaged the reputation of the Gallente Federation and undermined everything
    it stands for. \n\n\u201CWhat I would like to talk about here\u2026is the increasingly
    corrupt practices of our own fellow men, which in the long term, might seriously
    undermine the core values of our Federation, forged in suffering and battle by
    our ancestors,\u201D remarked Mr. Evacone in his opening statements to the surprised
    gathering of pilots. \n\nMr. Evacone added: \u201CI am talking about the attitude
    that will, in the long term, undermine our core values, replacing our striving
    for individualism, freedom and self-expression with lust for profit margins. I
    am talking about corruption at all levels, about the conspiracy among our 'captains
    of industry', about the ultimate greed.\u201D \n\n_ When pushed for more details
    and evidence of the corruption he was alleging, Mr. Evacone stated: \u201CI have
    definite proof that Chemal Tech employs undercover operatives to spy on, and actually
    sabotage the other corporations, both Gallente and foreign ones\u2026the evidence
    will be revealed in due course, and the sheer weight of it will be enough to make
    sure no one will try to repeat their underhand practices\u2026we are talking the
    ultimate degree of corruption here, the one that goes to high places. So I think
    you understand why I have to be careful.\u201D \n\nElaborating further on the
    current situation regarding the Kalaakiota research facility in Republic space,
    Mr. Evacone confirmed that Chemal Tech \u201Cis employing spies and saboteurs
    to operate abroad, with intentions to undermine operations of a certain Caldari
    corporation pursuing its legitimate business in Minmatar Republic\u2026if this
    goes on, I would like to ask you - how long is it before we find ourselves our
    own internal Kassigainen 'incident'? \n\nMr. Evacone\u2019s allegations were met
    with mixed reactions. One Federation official remarked that making such claims
    without solid evidence constituted an act of \u201Cextreme irresponsibility.\u201D
    Capsuleer pilots were dubious however, of Mr. Evacone\u2019s chance of a successful
    prosecution if he raised the issue exclusively through the normal legal methods,
    applauding him for blowing the whistle on his own people. \u201CThe best thing
    we must do is to expose the double-dealing and black-ops practices of our own
    corporations\u2026our ancestors did not fight a long and bloody war to become
    like Caldari, in the end,\u201D said Mr. Evacone in reply. \n\nHe stated that
    once he made the full evidence publicly available, he would nonetheless \u201Cpursue
    legal action\u2026and make sure they will not be able to continue their dirty
    tricks any longer.\u201D Many see his announcement in Luminaire as a shrewd political
    move. If his evidence is anywhere near as compelling as he claims it to be, then
    in all likelihood there will be a surge of public sentiment to support the legal
    battle, placing significant pressure on the Federation, and in particular Chemal
    Tech to explain itself. \n\nEvacone himself is a known ultra-liberal with a history
    for being just as critical of his own government as those abroad. His political
    commentaries which are featured in the Scope-owned daily magazine _Vramiere_ ,
    are highly popular amongst the younger Federation citizens. His latest article
    drew a record number of readers and has catapulted him to new levels of popularity
    in the Federation. \n\nAt the centre of the controversy is the research facility
    deployed in Republic space. A [communication](\u201Chttp://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=510037\u201D)
    made on Galnet late last month was brought to the attention of the Interstellar
    Correspondents and the general interstellar community when Tekkai Magha used it
    as the centerpiece for his latest conspiracy theory. \n\nIt is understood that
    the research facility belongs to the Kalaakiota Corporation. Information made
    available by Electus Matari pilot Evanda Char confirmed their involvement. The
    logs, which were intercepted and decoded, suggest that Kalaakiota have deployed
    a starbase somewhere in republic space, with comments from one of their operatives
    stating: \u201CConstruction of the outpost is complete\u201D. \n\nOther pilots
    from Takagi Corp came forward not long after the transmission, sharing further
    information. Most startling however was a particular line that mentioned \u201Chardware
    bought from Eifyr.\u201D The information implied that Kalaakiota itself was somehow
    involved directly in dealings with Eifyr & Co. who was previously thought to be
    scheming with Chemal Tech against them. \n\nMagha leaped on the communications
    logs, again stirring new conspiracies on the underground networks, with claims
    that Evacone and Maan were both \u201Cway off base\u201D. \n\n_\u201CThis is only
    confusing if you look at it from the usual perspective \u2013 one of national
    interest. It appears that greed has finally transcended nationalism. Yes that\u2019s
    right, transnational greed for a transnational conspiracy. Maan, Evacone\u2026they\u2019re
    right on some things, and miss the mark completely on others. Whether this was
    intentional or not, I can\u2019t say, but they\u2019re clearly wrong about the
    involvement of Eifyr and Co. and Chemal Tech. What we\u2019re looking at is some
    sort of shadowy deal between the three of them. It\u2019s hard to understand just
    in what way three such completely different organizations could be involved, but
    the facts speak for themselves.\u201D_\n\nEvacone dismissed Magha\u2019s assessment
    as \u201Claughable\u201D, claiming that the apparent collaboration between Kalaakiota
    and Eifyr  & Co. was \u201Csimply a case of the left hand not knowing what the
    right hand was doing\u201D and not representative of the larger machinations at
    hand. \n\n\u201CThere is no way the likes of Kalaakiota would associate with Eifyr
    & Co. The evidence I have shows this to be a matter of economics only. One group
    of people, who were not at the time representing Kalaakiota, buy from the lowest
    seller, who just happened to belong to a corporation that was in part, acting
    against their interests. When the time comes, what I have to say will leave little
    doubt about this.\u201D \n\nThe recent allegations have swung things around almost
    entirely, and now the political pressure surrounding the starbase in Republic
    space rests almost entirely on the shoulders of Chemal Tech and the Federation.
    Evacone was hesitant however, to label the State as completely blameless. \u201CThere\u2019s
    a very good reason why people no longer trust the Chief Executive Panel. I was
    surprised to see for once that they were actually the target of impropriety and
    not the source of it, it\u2019s almost a miracle. It\u2019s a sad day for the
    Federation when one can say truthfully that we have acted in a worse fashion than
    the Caldari.\u201D\n\nThere has still been no official response from Caldari State
    officials on the matter. Commenting on this, Evacone stated: \u201CThey may be
    vindicated in this matter, but they know they are in no position to gloat about
    it.\u201D"
