    Domain -** Icarus3, CEO of Daedalus X [DX4] successfully carried out a wormhole
    assault against his former employer, Eurzadahn, who is CEO of Tenichigo Kaigun
    [-KGN-] in an attempt to recover ISK he believes to be owed to him and the members
    of his corporation.   \n  \nAs the former -KGN- recruitment officer, Icarus3 claims
    that Eurzadahn stole hundreds of millions of ISK that was rightfully due to the
    members of the corporation. Icarus3 and other members grew concerned when funds
    generated from activities such as wormhole mining and security details found its
    way into the personal wallet of Eurzadahn rather than shared amongst those that
    contributed to the effort.  \n  \nRelationships broke down within Tenichigo Kaigun,
    amidst rumours that further ISK and ships were disappearing from the corporation.
    Icarus3 left with other aggrieved capsuleers and formed DX4. Their plan for revenge
    was devised, taking four months of preparation before the final blow was struck.
    \  \n  \nHaving discovered the wormhole in which Eurzadahn resided, a wormhole
    dubbed 'Cake' by capsuleers, Icarus3 entered the starbase owned by -KGN- using
    passwords he had acquired. Once inside, and with the help of his fellow capsuleers
    from DX4 he set about taking anything he could before Eurzadahn could act.   \n
    \ \nAmong the items taken from Eurzadahn were a Thanatos, Absolution and Orca
    as well as whatever the Orca could carry. The total value of goods stolen from
    -KGN- to is estimated at approximately 2 billion ISK, with further damages being
    inflicted militarily. On a final note about Eurzadahn, Icarus3 had this to say:
    \"I've never known a single [capsuleer] to accept so many loans and donations
    as Eurzadahn does. It's rather embarrassing to know I used to be under his command.\"
    \  \n  \nThe Interstellar Correspondents have recently managed to contact Eurzadahn,
    who adamantly denies Icarus3's allegations. A follow-up article will be published
    shortly.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this article? Do you have
