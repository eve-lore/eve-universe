- body: "DEKLEIN. Last fortnight saw the end of the civil war between the Northern
    Freedom Coalition and the Freelancer Alliance. The conflict had been brought about
    by rogue individuals in the NFC feeding false information to their leaders in
    order to break up the coalition between the two alliances. Peace was restored
    after diplomats from both sides met to negotiate the terms of a ceasefire. \n\nAvril
    Dewar, who recently took over the presidency of the NFC commented that at the
    time one person in NFC had been giving misleading intelligence to its leadership
    stating that \u201CFLA were not following the rules and wanted Deklein for themselves.\u201D
    She went on to explain that additional intelligence had suggested a massive build-up
    of warships and armaments by the FLA which led to her predecessors taking hostile
    action in the apparent defence of NFC. \n\nCommenting on the events leading up
    to the war, Dragonmorph of the FLA explained that the rogue pilot had \u201Cengineered
    a campaign of miss-information and distrust\u201D against his alliance which had
    led to the breakdown of the coalition. Attributing the motivations of this person
    to greed, he explained that the station holding corporation which had been managed
    by members of both alliances had been \u2018infiltrated\u2019 and the FLA members
    relieved of their control. When the decision was made by NFC to lower office rents
    and refinery taxes from twenty million ISK and 15% to five million ISK and 5%
    respectively, it seemed to be \u201Ctoo much to bear for those who had been lining
    their own pockets for so long.\u201D \n\nDragonmorph also explained how the pilots
    of Burn Eden and Alektorophobia alliance, who were \u201Clong standing friends
    and trading partners\u201D of the FLA had come to the aid of the beleaguered alliance
    during the conflict. He said that as a primarily industrial alliance with huge
    amounts of assets committed to the region and no real hope of defending them or
    escaping, morale was low until their allies arrived. \u201CThe effect on our members
    was electric! Industrialists became warriors. We instigated ship replacement programmes
    that attracted more of our empire members to join the fight for justice and equality.\u201D
    \n\nShin Ra of Burn Eden explained their motivations for helping the FLA; \u201CThis
    conflict occurred through power and greed of a few individuals. We saw this as
    an injustice of the highest order.\u201D She went on to add that although the
    pilots of Burn Eden were normally regarded as \u201Cpeople without morals\u201D
    they felt that the situation was wrong and warranted their direct intervention.
    \n\nWith the aid of Burn Eden and Alektorophobia, the Freelancer Alliance was
    able to retake the station in the 3JN9-Q solar system, and use it to levy peace
    talks with the NFC. Dragonmorph remarked that \u201CWith our friends we gained
    the upper hand. We could have pressed home the advantage. However, domination
    has never been our aim; the decision was made to once again invite our aggressors
    to talks.\u201D Commenting on the talks, Avril Dewar explained that Alektrophobia
    had been instrumental in negotiating the peace treaty; \u201CFollowing FLA taking
    the 3JN9-Q station, the Alektrophobia leader approached NFC and FLA with a set
    of terms which he believed suited both parties, after some discussion they were
    accepted by both sides.\u201D \n\nWith the ceasefire holding, both alliances seem
    optimistic about the future and the success of the Deklein coalition. In his closing
    remarks Dragonmorph explained that although there were challenges ahead, he has
    found the new NFC leadership to be open to suggestions and feels that the FLA
    \u201Ccan work alongside them to help maintain a happier and safer homeland for
    all of us.\u201D Avril Dewar had similar comments, explaining that she hoped NFC,
    FLA and the other coalition members could \u201Cwork together to build a strong,
    defendable region that can support our allies in the north.\u201D"
