    Heimatar** - On 1st November, G.A.N.J.A. commenced with their first violent protest

    \ \n  \n[![](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3527/ganjaithumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=)After
    previous [peaceful demonstrations](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=3472&tid=7)
    failed to garner a response, G.A.N.J.A. moved their plans forward and attacked
    three regions simultaneously within the Minmatar Republic in what they hoped would
    damage the Minmatar economy in retribution for damage done to Ammatar farmers
    during The Elder Invasion of YC110.  \n  \nOn this night alone, there were a total
    of 26 ships destroyed with an estimated total value of 11.000.000 ISK, with approximately
    5.500.000 ISK worth of goods salvaged from the wrecks. By selling the goods recovered
    from the convoys they destroy, G.A.N.J.A. hopes to stimulate trade and improve
    the local Ammatar economy.  \n  \nWhile scouting for another convoy to attack,
    Severed Savior, a High Scholar within G.A.N.J.A. said: \"As our membership grows,
    we can raid [more]; we plan some daring raids into the heart of the so-called
    Republic. Of course we cannot disclose pending operations, but they will be spectacular.\"
    \ \n  \nG.A.N.J.A. hopes for more support from capsuleers as their protests become
    more widespread and violent. With no official response to G.A.N.J.A.'s demands,
    it remains to be seen how far G.A.N.J.A. are willing to go in their protest. \n\n*
