- body: "Ammold - In celebration of the 5th Capsuleer Alliance tournament and as part
    of a recruitment showcase, the Republic Military school have held a special racing
    championship open to civilians to prove their piloting prowess. The event has
    been superbly attended and boasts a full roster of youthful and talented contestants
    all vying for the champions prize; the opportunity to enter the Republic Military
    School as a candidate for the Fleet Pod Pilot program. \n\nThe contest was open
    for any Republic citizen to apply, subject to undergoing a preliminary screening
    to ensure that the Pilot is compatible with Capsule technology. Due to the nature
    of the Capsule interface, only a small subset of the general population are both
    genetically and mentally compatible with the technology. \n\nPrior to the event
    Colonel Maata Nayeli had this to say: \n\n\"The Celebration Races are designed
    to give the talented youth of our society an opportunity to earn access to our
    prestigious program which they may not otherwise have. The Republic takes great
    pride in the accomplishments of its Capsuleers, many of whom get their start at
    our academy serving their people. \n\nThis competition shall pit the candidates
    against each other in a test of skill and bravery, each piloting a high speed,
    low altitude skimmer through a hair raising valley course used in our own live
    training exercises. Our Capsuleer graduates will likely be familiar with the course
    themselves, as the grand tournament plays out remember that some of those pilots
    started here!\" \n\nTragically the races have been cut short following a lethal
    high speed collision involving no less than three skimmers. As the pilots went
    all out to secure victory two craft collided whilst entering a narrow pass, the
    third skimmer was caught by debris and also crashed. None of the three pilots
    survived and the remainder of the race has been canceled. \n\nAn investigation
    has already begun as critics level charges of neglect and of the 'irresponsible
    attitudes' of race organisers endangering young pilots in what is coming to be
    labeled a publicity stunt to promote the image of the Republic's Capsuleer program.
    \n\nOrganisers of the Alliance Tournament have expressed their dismay at such
    a sad event occurring as part of the celebrations associated with the tournament
    and their regrets at the tragic loss of such young and brave people."
