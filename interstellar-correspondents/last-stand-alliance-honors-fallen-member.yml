    \\- A memorial service was held for Last Stand [LS] alliance diplomat Psi Cloned
    of Forsaken Resistance [FRCRP]. Psi Cloned's sudden and unexpected death prompted
    his alliance mates to hold this \"sending off\" in \"honor of his life, and his
    contributions to their lives\" states Marrick Drak of Senatus Populusque Romanus
    [SPQR2][LS].  \n  \nAs described by Marrick, \"the service was held in the Bika
    system, at a planet, we anchored an arc of cans labeled to pay tribute to him,
    and in the center of this arc we placed a fraction of his corpse collection; 554
    corpses to be exact\", adding further that, \"a few of the corpses were 'donated'
    by fellow alliance members who podded themselves, regardless of augmentations,
    in order to ensure that they too could dance in the vacuum of space in honor of
    our fallen comrade.\"  \n  \nAccording to Littlefinger, CEO of Forsaken Resistance
    and Executor of the Last Stand alliance, \"Psi was best known, hands down, for
    helping others with his time, assets and knowledge and putting their needs in
    front of his own. He was a great conversationalist and worked tirelessly at learning
    the needs and wants of everyone in the alliance.\"  \n  \nTshal [FRCRP][LS], his
    long time girlfriend, also a capsuleer, has been given access to Psi Cloned's
    hangar and will attempt to continue his legacy within the alliance. Jaana Brill
    of Frequent Flyers [FFLG][LS] adds lastly, that \"his friends miss him something
    awful.\"\n\n \n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this article? Do you
