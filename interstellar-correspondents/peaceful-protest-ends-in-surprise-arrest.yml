- body: "To make themselves heard, several members of the Placid Militia and Illoren
    marched from Stacmon to Luminaire to confront Inspector Xavier, the head of the
    regional drugs squad. The protest was called because of the lack of commendation
    and recognition for the work of the Placid Militia and Illoren in the recent capture
    of the drug filled Serpentis Carrier. \n\nInspector Xavier still stands by the
    fact that it was the work of his drug squad, however the Militia tell a different
    story. They claim that they disabled the support team and the carrier. The Inspector
    dismissed the claims on the spot and asked for _\u201Canyone with any proof to
    these claims to come forward and dock to hand me these items\u201D_\n\nVorada
    Kuvakei, Shoran Mulsokai and Vey Telmoth, all members of Illoren docked at the
    station in the hope of showing the public what the Inspectors team really is.
    However, Inspector Xavier had other plans as Illoren had found out. All three
    were arrested immediately after docking by the Federation Intelligence Office
    for charges of \u2018Interfering with official FIO investigation, which touches
    upon direct interests of the Federation'. \n\nThe population of the Luminaire
    erupted into disorder at the surprise arrest, while the Inspector and his team
    watched on, continuing to celebrate. I asked Pytria Le'Danness, a member of the
    Placid Militia, what she thought of the arrests _\u201CIt definitely was the wrong
    time, because Vorada has been the pivotal point of a major victory against the
    Serpentis, a victory that could have helped the whole Federation, and not just
    the career of one inspector\u201D_. _\u201CNot based on the evidence available
    to myself\u201D_ , I also asked Crausaum of his thoughts on the arrest. \n\nThe
    Federation is looking to thanks its loyal supporters by awarding medals to people
    who have been highly commended because of their acts within the past few months,
    against the Serpentis. \n\nThe trial date of all the Illoren pilots and of the
    Serpentis Carrier pilots are yet to be announced, but are expected to be soon.
    All that the militia ask for is that there is a _\u201CFair trial for the Illoren
    that proves they are innocent of the charges and that matters can be resolved
    amicably.\u201D_"
