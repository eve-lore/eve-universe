    a day of conflict and loss, as enemies of the loyalists attacked a vigil gathered
    to honor the life and service of the late Emperor Doriam II. \n\nIt was two years
    ago when the Amarrian Emperor was assassinated by unknown parties. The murder
    struck a heavy blow to the Amarrian people that is still felt today as they continue
    without any replacement. July 5th of this year marked the second anniversary of
    his death. In an act of remembrance, capsuleers loyal to the Amarrian Empire gathered
    outside the Emperor Station in Amarr to pay their respects in a vigil lead by
    the Curatores Veritatis Alliance and members of PIE Inc. \n\nHowever, this was
    not to be. The peaceful vigil quickly descended into violence as soon as the procession
    arrived outside the station. A fleet consisting of almost forty ships belonging
    to both the Star Fraction and Ushra\u2019Khan alliances intercepted the Amarrian
    loyalists and vicious fighting ensued. The battle, which reportedly lasted almost
    thirty minutes, resulted in a significant loss of vessels on both sides, with
    less loss of equipment and life on the side of the SF/UK forces. \n\nFollowing
    the attack, bitter words were exchanged on Galnet as the Amarrian bloc defended
    the record of Doriam II. They criticized the aggressors for not honoring the life
    of a man they claimed had at times acted in ways that even their enemies should
    have respected. Ushra\u2019Khan and The Star Fraction largely left their own actions
    to speak for the level of respect they had. \n\nVarious moments in the long life
    of Emperor Doriam II were atypical of many other Amarrian leaders throughout the
    Empire. He once famously declared that all slaves should be treated humanely.
    He was also responsible at one time for the freeing of several thousand slaves
    in a failed attempt to return them to the Republic, a move that was later thwarted
    by the Order of Tetrimon. For this reason and others, there were some entities
    such as Electus Matari and Fate Weavers whose attendance was of a more peaceful
    nature, despite their deep ideological differences with the Amarrians. Some even
    attended in Vigil-class frigates in a display of recognition of a man they later
    stated wasn\u2019t entirely devoid of merit. \n\nMaggot of the Ushra\u2019Khan
    was amongst many who saw the additional symbolic success achieved by his forces
    and their friends that day, describing the event as \u201Cthe greatest victory
    for the Ushra\u2019Khan in two years.\u201D Others labeled it a crippling defeat
    to Amarrian pride. The Amarrians themselves showed great disdain for the violence
    and disruption, but were quick to ridicule any suggestions that they had been
    shaken or significantly affected by the attacks."
