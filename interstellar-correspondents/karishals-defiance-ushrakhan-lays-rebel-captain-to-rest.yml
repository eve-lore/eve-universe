- body: "QR-K85. Late Sunday evening the body of Karishal Muritor was transported
    from the UNITY outpost in 9UY4-H in a solemn procession led by Ushra\u2019Khan.
    The recently deceased, a hero to many young and increasingly disillusioned Matari,
    was interred only two jumps away at a station named \u201CKarishal\u2019s Defiance\u201D
    in his honour, the new name for the ex-ISS outpost now under Ushra\u2019Khan management.
    \n\nSpeaking to the large fleet assembled in 9UY4-H to honour the rebel leader\u2019s
    final wishes, Sapphrine of the Ushra\u2019Khan gave a stirring speech to his comrades,
    excerpts of which follow.\n\n_\u201CWe gather here today in honour of the fallen.
    The comrades of a martyred hero, who have charged us of the Ushra\u2019Khan with
    a solemn duty. We are entrusted with keeping in trust the body of Karishal Muritor,
    former Captain of the Republic and leader of the honoured Defiants who now live
    in exile for their beliefs. Struck down by his former comrades in the Republic
    Fleet under a flag of truce, Karishal died an outcast, a victim of political convenience.
    Until the day comes when we may return Karishal to his homelands to be laid to
    rest, it is our duty to care for him. Today we take this fallen warrior to a place
    of honour, where he may lie\u2026until he may take his final journey home at last.\u201D_\n\nBefore
    setting out towards the new outpost, the fleet moved in the direction of the 4B-NQN
    stargate, in a symbolic gesture showing their initial wish to place Muritor\u2019s
    body in the Minmatar Republic homeland as he had wished. In a moment of tense
    silence, the fleet slowly idled towards the gate as thousands of Matari, pilot
    and crew alike, laid their eyes upon the first step on the path leading back to
    a Republic that refused to acknowledge Muritor, even in death. Shortly after,
    the three words: \u201CWe go now,\u201D echoed sharply across comms lines, bringing
    the procession back from their wishful reveries of a different future. \n\nArriving
    at the QR-K85 system, the Ushra\u2019Khan procession was met by members of the
    ISS, who transferred their outpost to the U\u2019K. Sapphrine once again gave
    a short speech:\n\n_\u201CToday is an historic day. Today we mark the closing
    of one chapter in history, and at the same time, the beginning of a new one. We
    now deliver the body of Karishal Muritor to this station where he will for a time,
    lie at rest under our care. We have been charged this duty by Karishal\u2019s
    loyal warriors of The Defiants; to some day return the fallen hero of the Republic
    home. It is the request of The Defiants that this be done peacefully and with
    dignity, so an appeal has been made to the Republic leadership that we may be
    allowed to do this. Our request has been denied. It would not have been Karishal\u2019s
    wish for us to go against this and so instead we must bide our time, and wait
    for the proper day to come.\u201D_\n\nFollowing this, a few members of the ISS
    spoke to the crowd, with Elisa Day first stating: \u201CWith the end of the ISS
    outpost era, we deliver this station into the hands of our friends, the Ushra\u2019Khan,
    we hope it will serve them as well as it has served us.\u201D Her words were followed
    by Argenta Nataf, who added: \u201CWe would like to thank Ushra\u2019Khan for
    their assistance and loyalty in our time of need. We hope that this outpost will
    become a beacon of freedom and commerce in the galaxy and we have great confidence
    of its future in your hands.\u201D\n\nAs the ISS representatives took their place
    besides the station again, Sapphrine spoke one last time:\n\n_\u201CKarishal Muritor,
    Captain First Class of the Republic Fleet, recipient of the Drupar\u2019s Star,
    chose to sacrifice his career and enter into exile in order to follow his beliefs.
    The great man defied the law to uphold his moral obligation to serve those who
    needed him most. He and his men sacrificed their freedom as citizens to fight
    for the freedom of others. Ultimately Karishal laid down his life rather than
    raise his hand against his former comrades and was gunned down in cold-blooded
    murder. In his final words he begged us not to fire upon the Republic, and did
    not defend himself against them. He spoke to his killers of the achievements that
    had already been made, and implored the Fleet to stand tall and united. He spoke
    of defiance, and of hope. It is to Karishal\u2019s hopes that now dedicate this
    place. Today it becomes a new symbol. We name this station \u201CKarishal\u2019s
    Defiance\u201D... Here we lay Karishal Muritor to rest until the day comes that
    the Matari stand again united in purpose. His return will be the day that Matar
    stands united against oppression, as was his dream.\u201D_\n\nAfterwards, the
    fleet docked at their newly renamed station, leaving their ships to pay their
    respects to Muritor at the foot of his tomb. In a brief interview following the
    ceremony, Tar Kovsky of the Ushra\u2019Khan shared his own thoughts on the fallen
    Captain: \u201CIn the course of his career, Captain Muritor witnessed a lot of
    suffering by our people, I think that over time, the lack of serious action on
    the part of the Republic began to wear on him\u2026I always had the impression
    that he carried the \u2018weight of the universe\u2019 on himself\u2026I know
    that it really tore him up to leave Republic service the way that he did, but
    he just felt that he had no other choice\u2026he was someone who cared too much
    to stand by in the face of suffering.\u201D \n\nWhen asked of the future, and
    if they hoped to ever fulfil the wishes of Muritor and his men and take him home
    to the Republic, Mr Kovsky stated: \u201CWe of the Ushra\u2019Khan take our commitments
    very seriously, and we promised The Defiants that we would respect the Captain\u2019s
    wishes in this regard. The current regime cannot last forever.\u201D\n\nShortly
    after, the IC also spoke with Kell Atorr, a junior diplomat and representative
    of Namtz\u2019aar K\u2019in who wished to comment. \u201CWe have been hoping that
    the remains of Karishal Muritor could be returned to his homeworld and his kin.
    As I understand, the Parliament objected to the manner in which Ushra\u2019Khan
    proposed to return Muritor\u2019s remains to Matar. Third parties did offer to
    assist\u2026I think we must understand that Muritor\u2026was a tragic figure.
    We support the Republic governments\u2019 actions, but we take no joy in the course
    of events. Karishal Muritor spent many years in honourable service to the Republic
    and to our people, and that too, must not be forgotten.\u201D\n\nIt is understood
    that Muritor\u2019s tomb will be open for his kin and the general public to visit
    in order to pay their respects. It is expected that many thousands of Matari will
    make the long journey to the new outpost over the coming weeks to do just that."
