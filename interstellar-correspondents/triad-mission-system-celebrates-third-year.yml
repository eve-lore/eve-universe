    Celebrates its third year of offering private agents and campaigns to the capsuleers
    of New Eden.  \n  \nT.R.I.A.D began development in YC108 and offers a multitude
    of mission types for capsuleers. Missions are added regularly to broaden the appeal
    of this type of agency.  \n  \nDet Resprox, CEO of T.R.I.A.D explained the Campaigns
    that are available within the corporation, \"Once a pilot accepts a 'Campaign',
    he becomes its fleet commander and other agency pilots can join the mission, which
    could take hours or days to complete depending on the opposition fielded.\" T.R.I.A.D
    have recently ended a campaign against the Amarr empire.  \n  \nA drawback of
    T.R.I.A.D is that they are not officially licensed, and therefore some combat
    mission involved with T.R.I.A.D could result in criminal flagging from CONCORD.
    \ \n  \nT.R.I.A.D is open to every capsuleer, and therefore anyone interested
    in joining should contact T.R.I.A.D directly at their home system at Teonusude
