- body: "**Uncharted Space** \\- Myon Decay became the latest corporation to fall
    victim to corporate espionage this week, as Director of Security, Shaddhix, used
    his access to empty corporate coffers and steal a tower from a wormhole location.
    Corporation CEO Rakadar believes the loss is valued in excess of 1 billion ISK.\n\n[![Caldari
    Control Tower](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2962/caldaritowerthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F2962%2Fcaldaritower.png)According
    to the mastermind behind the theft, Shaddhix, \"...a plan started to formulate
    in my mind, a way to repay the kindness and loyalties shown to me by the greatest
    corporation I've ever worked for, Equitatus of Apocalypse.\"\n\nAs Myon Decay
    deployed a tower into an uncharted region through a wormhole, and began harvesting
    the resources found therein, more and more corporation members were lured there
    with the promise of wealth. Within a short period of time, the tower housed a
    full ship maintenance array and corporate hangar as well as the hardware necessary
    to start production on components for strategic cruisers. \n\nIt was then that
    Shaddhix decided, \"I was going to steal the [Tower].\"\n\n\"The first order of
    business,\" explains Shaddhix, \"was contacting my old corpmates of [Equitatus
    of Apocalypse], who were naturally very excited about the prospects of such a
    caper.  Then, I had to find an excuse to get [Myon Decay] out of its alliance.
    That opportunity presented itself when the alliance adopted a new corporation
    with a pre-existing [war], and I argued that this was trouble we did not need.
    Once that was taken care of, it was simply a matter of subtly encouraging as many
    members as possible to bring in as many assets as possible to the wormhole [tower].\"\n\nOnce
    everything was rolling, it was only a matter of patience, and planning, as Shaddhix
    spent time working out the details of the heist.  Then, during the evening hours
    of the 24th, the opportunity presented itself.\n\n\"When the new wormhole opened
    up last night around 03:00 in Ogoten, just 10 jumps from [Equitatus of Apocalypse]
    Corporate Headquarters in Gulfonodi, we knew it was our chance.\" Shaddhix explains
    that haulers and pilots sprang into action, seizing the opportunity to empty the
    tower, offline its hardware, and remove the tower.  It wasn't to be as easy as
    hoped, though, as a member of Myon Decay, Stoiley, showed up unexpectedly.  According
    to Shaddhix, \"I simply explained that I was reorganizing the corp hangar, and
    continued to haul load after load of materials and items out from under his nose...\"\n\nThe
    final details wrapping up the heist, according to Shaddhix, were pretty straight
    forward, \"While we sorted out the take and made the necessary contracts to consolidate
    the new assets, I emptied the [Corporate] coffers, both the wallet and all assets
    at all of our offices. Just before [a daily break] I submitted a corpmail announcing
    my resignation as Security Director, citing that, as I had just stolen everything,
    there was nothing left for me to secure.\"\n\nThe news was understandably not
    well received by the members of Myon Decay. CEO Rakadar states, \"...some [members]
    will leave, all are...well angry isn't the right word to describe it...\"\n\nWhen
    asked if he saw any signs looking back on behavior, Rakadar replied, \"...I didn't
    expect this. I wouldn't say there had been any too obvious signs.\" He continues,
    \"I trusted him as he joined us when we were involved in factional warfare, and
    when we moved on to wormhole space exploration he was a great help in setting
    up our operations there.  He only became Security Director after we were doing
    wormhole space exploration for some time...as a reward for his commitment to our
    work [and] as a sign of my trust...well...so much for that.\"\n\n \n\n* * *\n\nAre
