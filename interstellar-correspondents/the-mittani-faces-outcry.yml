    Jita, The Forge** \\- Protests are taking place following the recent words spoken

    He has his own corp... find him.\"[![Jita Protests Reignite](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4949/id4949-1thumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4949/id4949-1.png)
    \  \n  \nSpeaking to the capsuleer, however, he finds these comments and the aggression
    \"unprovoked\".   \n  \nA number of capsuleers have called for the resignation
    of The Mittani. While he has many supporters, there seems to be those who feel
    that as a community figure he should be held to a higher standard and should not
    publicly call for the killing of another capsuleer.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[The
