    PERRIGEN FALLS** \\- Last Friday, BigMaman, long-time member and director of the
    Solar Dragons corporation, claims to have relieved her corporation of about 900
    billion ISK in assets.  \n  \nAfter more than five years of loyalty, internal
    quarrels within the leadership were the deciding factors for her to betray her
    corporation. Having had access to all corporation funds and assets, capsuleer
    BigMaman was able to deal substantial albeit temporary damage to the Solar Dragons.
    \ \n  \nIn a message to the Interstellar Correspondents, BigMaman explained that
    after joining the Solar Dragons in early 2006, she quickly advanced to the position
    of a director and participated in numerous operations with the corporation.  \n
    \ \nBigMaman also said that besides combat activity, most of the time her duties
    included \"organizational and administrative work, management of [the] corporation,
    logistics, capital and supercapital building, espionage\", as well as \"POS management
    (sometimes [I maintained] about 50 POSes alone).\"  \n  \nThe decision to betray
    her corporation was made after her long-time close friend and CEO MACTEP, who
    had previously been a great comrade, decided to dissociate himself from Maman
    and follow a less amicable course; \"he has decided to show me his power and specify
    me my place (without any reasons on that).\" She noted that MACTEP had hindered
    her from using the internal forums as well as held back and/or strictly censored
    important information regarding dire problems within the alliance.  \n  \nAs for
    Maman's \"compensation fee\", as she likes to call it, she took 350 billion in
    liquid ISK and between 400 and 600 billion in assorted assets as well as some
    capsuleer associates the corporation had hired for her for approximately another
    100 billion ISK. The quantity of supercapitals she might have stolen remains a
    secret.  \n  \nEven though she claims to have stolen about 900 billion ISK, BigMaman
    believes the damage she caused is not that big compared to what she could have
    done. Maman would have been able to disband both SOLAR FLEET and SOLAR Wing and
    believes she would also have been able to incite a coup d'etat against one of
    the leaders. However, she states she \"didn't have any reasons to cause [...]
    damage to an alliance and the constructed system. [Many of the] pilots [were]
    my good friends till now (and they [don't all] condemn me).\"  \n  \nWhen asked
    how she felt about the consequences for the corporation, she said \"Everything
    that I've taken away - will be easily restored, within 7-8 months or faster. I
    think - I have given a good lesson to the person how to correctly behave with
    people.\"  \n  \nBigMaman also mentioned that there were many people who had contacted
    her to show their respect and admiration and that she already had received offers
    from other alliances that would be interested in her work.  \n  \nSolar Dragon
    CEO MACTEP refused to comment, saying the situation was \"banal\" and that there
    would be \"no sense to speak about it.\"\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Original
