    containing a Minmatar Service Outpost Platform, details have emerged of an internal
    conflict between founding corporations and other members of the alliance.\n\nPreviously,
    current Consortium. Alliance leader Shmak DatAsh claimed that his fellow alliance
    leader attempted to seize control of the alliance after the loss. \"[R0ck Muncher]
    saw this as an opportunity to take over and attempted to, but failed... I considered
    R0ck Muncher a good friend of mine and everyone in his corp, [but] being backstabbed
    by him and his corp hurt.\"   \n  \nFollowing these allegations, R0ck Muncher,
    a founding member of the alliance, commented on the supposed \"coup\". He said
    he started a vote to become CEO of the holding corporation, effectively giving
    him command of the alliance, which may have sparked the rumour. This gave his
    corporation 24 hours to remove all of their assets from the area in relative safety
    from the remaining alliance members.   \n  \nbugs 11, an ex member of Consortium.
    confirmed that R0ck Muncher had not attempted to take over the alliance but was
    trying to protect his members. bugs 11 said he felt Consortium. was disintegrating
    and did not believe matters would improve.   \n  \nR0ck Muncher also had doubts
    about the alliance's future \"...[The alliance] will cascade.... I hope in a way
    it does not and would like to see it succeed... but unless [Shmak DatAsh] drops
    command it will fail.\"   \n  \n\"They are around 450 members I think and about
    to lose another 100 by the weekend because of [Shmak DatAsh's] attitude,\" R0ck
    Muncher stated.   \n  \nMeanwhile, Shmak DatAsh says he is rebuilding the alliance.
    \"We're currently working on recruiting a 360-man alliance, and three 100ish-man
    corps... We're halfway to our goal of a new [station].\"   \n  \nShmak DatAsh
    also confirmed Consortium. would be working alongside Atlas in future, but said
    that he wants the alliance back to the strength it had before it split over the
    Outpost Platform loss, before the new partnership goes ahead.\n\n* * *\n\nAre
