    Lonetrek** - On 05.05.112 at 20:00, a memorial service was held for those who
    lost their lives when a Nyx-class supercarrier, the \"Wandering Saint\" was rammed
    into the Ishukone Corporation headquarters two years ago. At the end of the memorial,
    organizer John Revenant was executed by a Star Fraction fleet led by Jade Constantine.
    \  \n  \nThe service, arranged by John Revenant (leader of the Ishuk-Raata Enforcement
    Directive [I-RED] alliance), was held in Malkalen under a blanket of anticipation.
    Information on the local communications network claimed a fleet, possibly made
    up of Star Fraction [-SF-] pilots who were at war with I-RED, was heading towards
    the system with the potential to disrupt the service.   \n  \n[![Malkalen Disaster
    Video News Report ](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3872/malkalendisastervideofront3thumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.youtube.com/user/CCPGAMES?blend%3D2%26ob%3D1%23p/c/F614A7A6461E61E1/10/uSHdIsIOrsc)The
    first speaker at the service was Cheiftan, a member of the Shinryaku corporation,
    who reminded everyone present of how representatives of the Caldari and Gallente
    had come together in this system two years ago to try to cement peaceful relations
    between their peoples. Admiral Alexander Noir put an end to those hopes when he
    rammed his Nyx into the station where the delegates were meeting, resulting in
    the death of over 421,000 people including the Ishukone corporation CEO, Otro
    Gariushi. Many at the service considered the victims of this disaster to be heroes.
    \"\u2026Every man, woman and child who died there that day should be known and
    remembered as true hero[es] to all.\"   \n  \nShortly after the service began,
    Jade Constantine, leader of -SF- arrived in the system along with an entourage
    of pilots including The Cosmopolite. Star Fraction representatives had previously
    expressed views that the memorial service should not be conducted by John Revenant
    because of I-RED's former connection to CVA, which they claimed dishonoured the
    memory of Otro Gariushi. They apparently requested a 'face to face' meeting with
    the organizer, John Revenant, who reportedly ignored the request at the time,
    proceeding with the ceremony.   \n  \nAt the conclusion of the service John Revenant
    said \"We have gathered here to pay the respects of fallen comrades [sic.], Gallente,
    and Caldari, and I for one will not keep you from doing so\u2026 I must attend
    to our friends outside who would disrupt this peaceful memorial.\" He then undocked
    in a Raven-class battleship and made his way to the site of the disaster to meet
    with Jade Constantine.   \n  \nWhat, if anything, was discussed at the meeting
    is unclear, but it is documented that John Revenant's vessel was targeted, fired
    upon, and destroyed by Star Fraction ships. John Revenant stated \"I knew I was
    in danger but I was prepared to make the attempt. I thought they would be a little
    more honorable and respect a diplomatic encounter.\" Star Fraction's declaration
    of war against I-RED was withdrawn shortly after the event.  \n  \nTwo years have
    passed, but the conflict between the Federation and the State still rages. It
    was hoped by many at the service that this memorial, to those who died when Admiral
    Noir rammed his Nyx into the Ishukone station and to the peace that nearly was,
    may be enough for another attempt to be made.\n\n### Galnet References\n\n[Ishukone
