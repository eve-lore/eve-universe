- body: "Freelance Unincorporated, a Minmatar freedom fighter corporation and member
    of the Ushra\u2019Khan alliance, announced today that they will compile a list
    of capsule pilots actively engaged in slave trade for use of Ushra\u2019Khan  \n
    \ \nAccording to Maggot, Freelance Unincorporated pilot, they will offer individuals
    and corporations engaged in slave trading a chance to repent first, rather then
    naming and shaming slavers out in the open unlike previous lists, most noteworthy
    those released by Gradient.  \n  \nIt remains to be seen what effect this has
    on slave trade throughout the empire territories. Although the Amarr are stoic
    as ever and will most likely not be swayed by threats of conflict, corporations
    consisting of mixed races could face trouble as their slave trading members are
    called on to repent for their actions.  \n  \nMore information will follow as
    we receive it."
