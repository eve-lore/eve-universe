    , During the \"Full Metal Jacket\" event organized by T'Amber of Ships of Eve
    corporation [SOE-E], two participants are alleged to have stolen \"400 frigates,
    200 or so skill books and a large amount of assorted tech 1 modules\" valued at
    \"around 500 million isk.\" T'Amber, who runs these events for rookie capsuleers
    has put a hold on giving out any free prizes until \"corpses and killmails are
    supplied\".  \n  \nThe event, which was a \"red vs. blue\" team combat, was to
    have culminated in the winning team receiving free tickets to an upcoming \"Ships
    of Eve main event\" with the \"'biggest killer' receiving a tech 2 High Grade
    Halo Implant set, along with some tech 2 ships, tickets and shares (in the SOE
    corporation)\".  \n  \nT'Amber has fingered SOE Blood Anarchist, formerly of Ships
    of Eve Blue Team [SOE-B], now a member of Native Fresh Foods [NF], and SOE Canock
    [SOE-B] as the alleged perpetrators. Citing reports by fellow team members and
    \"watching the hangar when SOE Canock was in the station, and purposefully disallowing
    and then re-allowing his rights so that I could actually see the items being stolen\"
    T'Amber considers this proof enough to call for the podding of said pilots. According
    to T'Amber both pod pilots have ties to the Obsidian Cartel [-.O.-] which is \"based
    in a system next to Rens\" and ultimately feels the goods may have been warehoused
    there in.  \n  \nAsked whether this will change her approach to these events,
    T'Amber replied \"stealing items from a free event is lame\" adding that \"I will
    be adjusting the way I will distribute the free skills and ships with private
    contracts next time.\"  \n  \nThe Ships of Eve corporation runs free events for
    New Eden's pod pilot community which are paid for by \"Main Events\" that usually
    cost ten million ISK per ticket to enter.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the
