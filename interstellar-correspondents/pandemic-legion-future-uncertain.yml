    come to the attention of the Interstellar Correspondents that in the next few
    days the future of Pandemic Legion will be decided, [with strong talk indicating
    they will be disbanding.](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1406008)
    \ \n  \nRifts have apparently occured inside the alliance with many members becoming
    disillusioned by the lack of leadership and activity. Wrik Hoover, of North Eastern
    Swat [NESW] said \"a lot of operations were cancelled due [to fleet commander's
    not showing up].\"  \n  \nEmergency meetings have apparently taken place with
    council members, and Sjoor, a member of S.A.S [-SAS-], said \"the council will
    meet this weekend on Saturday Evening. Disband the alliance or keep rolling with
    the few corps that want to stay.\"  \n  \nElise Randolph, another member of Pandemic
    Legion admitted \"things are looking a bit grim at the moment.\"  \n  \nTensions
    are currently rising between member corporations as rumours escalate. Wrik Hoover
    was quick to dismiss claims that NESW are about to join IT Alliance, while Sjoor
    said that -SAS- are readying to join Aralis at Curatores Veritatis Alliance.  \n
    \ \nMeanwhile, CEO of NESW, Shadoo gave this statement on his future: \"I am sorry,
    but I am unable to comment on the current state of the affairs, since I am in
    final discussions about joining Morsus Mihi.\"  \n  \nVuk Lau, of Morsus Mihi,
    revealed that his belief was that ElitestOps are set to join TEST alliance and
    that was all he was prepared to comment on, claiming \"trillions of ISK is at
    stake\" and that he doesn't want to \"ignite the flames of drama\".  \n  \nWith
    so much going on within Pandemic Legion at the moment as they struggle for some
    sort of order, it is clear there is tension and perhaps Sjoor put the situation
    into words best, saying: \"I wouldn't be surprised to see PL supercaps die tomorrow,
    killed by PL.\"\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this article? Do
