    the hours passed the battle continued to rage as the battle participation reached
    over 1900 pilots. Black Legion [MEN.] entered the battle with a Dreadnought fleet
    at which point PL, Northern Coalition [NC.] and [S2N] committed Titans to the
    battle.\n\nGoonswarm [CONDI] entered the fray nominally on the side of [-DD-]
    with a Dominix fleet as sub capitals laboriously worked to bump an [NC.] Erebus
    away from its support fleet.\n\nAfter 8 hours of raging combat, system communications
    collapsed on both sides and the battle came to an abrupt end. Hostilities are
    expected to continue in the near future. No Titans were destroyed in this battle.\n\n[![](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/65390/1/Super_Capital_Fleets_on_Field_-small.jpg)](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/65390/1/Super_Capital_Fleets_on_Field.png)\n\nAn
