    \ \n  \nAccording to John Caldr of White Noise. alliance, the kill was achieved
    by using a carrier to entice the titan pilot to pounce on a seemingly undefended
    prey.  \n  \nThe trap was sprung when kn0chenk0tz3r unleashed her doomsday on
    the carrier. A waiting White Noise. Fleet was bridged into range and closed in
    for the kill.  \n  \nEvery victory comes at a price. John Caldr confirmed that
    the Northern Coalition rallied to rescue the titan and fielded four times as many
    pilots than White Noise: this caused White Noise. to lose at least three capital
    ships, including a Moros, a Revelation and an Archon plus several support vessels.
    \ \n  \nWith the Titan's damage into the hull, kn0chenk0tz3r's allies were running
    against the clock to save her: \"it took [White Noise.] only 4-5 minutes to kill
    my ship... my backup was 3 jumps out when I went down,\" she said.  \n  \nWhile
    TraderJohn, Diplomat for Morsus Mihi, acknowledged that \"a titan loss is never
    acceptable,\" He is also confident however that the titan will be rebuilt.  \n
    \ \nKn0chenk0tz3r confirmed she already has plans to use the future titan to continue
    ambushing unsuspecting capitals. Just with more caution, this time.\n\n### GalNet
