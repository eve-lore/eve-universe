    <http://at7.eve-ic.net/>\n\nTournament VI's match reports were an excellent way
    to provide you with detailed reports of the action. Great write ups, pictures
    added to highlight the excitement. Surely this was enough, right? Well... not
    quite. This time around, Interstellar Correspondents has stepped it up a notch
    with an all new IC Alliance Tournament web site![![](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3380/at7thumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F3380%2Fat7.png)
    \ \n  \nThe all new Tournament site is up and ready to provide you with an amazing
    amount of data. In addition to the match reports and images, you can now view
    statistical charts and graphs posted within minutes of the end of each match.
    Waiting around for the next match with nothing to do? Head over to the alliance
    bio section to familiarize yourself with some of the basic facts about the competing
    alliances. As soon as they become available, videos will be added to the match
    reports as well.  \n  \nWe hope you will find our site both informative and entertaining.\n\n
