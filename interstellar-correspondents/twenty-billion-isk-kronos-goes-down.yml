    this month a Kronos-class marauder owned by mission runner Willbur was destroyed
    by capsuleer pirates in the Irjunen solar system. The loss is estimated at about
    19.7 Billion ISK.  \n  \nWillbur, a member of IMpAct Corporation, was assaulted
    by ten members of 'The Inf1dels'. The pirate fleet was comprised of eight Raven's,
    one Tempest, and one Armageddon.  \n  \nSome of the more expensive modules that
    were lost in the attack included; Chelm's Modified Cap Recharger, (8,000.00 M
    ISK), Selynne's Modified Cap Recharger (3,050.00 M ISK), Brokara's Modified Cap
    Recharger (1,800.00 M ISK), Chelm's Modified Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane
    (2,800.00 M ISK), Centus X-Type Large Armor Repairer (1,350.00 M ISK) and two
    Corpum A-Type Energized Adaptive Nano Membranes (1,200.00 M ISK).  \n  \nWillbur
    was in seemingly good spirits after the loss, describing The Inf1dels attack as
    a \"good shot\", and expressing his surprise after the attack; \"I didn't know
    that it was possible to [kill] a sturdy battleship inside the empire. [New Eden]
    will always surprise me. And that's what makes [it] exciting.\"\n\n### GalNet
