    channels lately, it would seem that they will not be fulfilled in the near future;
    the northern forces had barely began moving out when a new conflict emerged in
    the regions, this time between former allies, namely the Stain- Alliance and Firmus
    Ixion. \n\nTensions started when FIX had reset their standings towards the SA
    to neutral thereby invoking friendly-fire incidents. Elaborating on the issue,
    Gritt Pebbledasher, one of the FIX Joint Chiefs of Staff, affirmed that \u201CThe
    Stain- Alliance repeatedly violated the sovereignty of our space and fired on
    our members; these are not the actions of a friend and so our move to change standings
    merely accurately described the situation of their making\u201D.  \nThis move
    was seen as an insult by the SA, for whom the \u201Cso called violations\u201D
    were very minor, as described by Orc A, who went on to explain that \u201Cthe
    SA saw in FIX a great ally that came to aid us in a time of trouble. You can imagine
    how confused we were when we heard the news\u201D.  \nConfusion that did not to
    last very long, since reprisal was swift, with the Stain- Alliance launching a
    swift and accurate military strike on FAST, or FIX Accessible Space Territory,found
    to the west of Catch. \n\nAt the heart of this conflict is the Catch region, which
    was [handed over to FIX by the Stain Empire](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=223090)
    during the civil war that opposed them to the SA. GalNet observers were quick
    to point out that it had the potential of undermining the already fragile relations
    between the SA and FIX.  \nWhile it may not be the richest of regions, Catch is
    a key region for a lot of the southern alliances who use it as a corridor to and
    from Empire space; as such it holds strategic importance for any group holding
    it. \n\nWhilst the border incidents and the tactical weight of the region played
    an important part in deteriorating relations between both parties, Pebbledasher
    thinks that the Stain- Alliance \u201Ccovets FIX territory\u201D, going even further
    to say that, \u201Ctheir avarice has lead \u2026 to initiate, what in their minds
    always was, an acquisitive conflict.\u201D This allegation is not completely refuted
    by Orc A, who justifies their action: \u201CIt's time for more cooperative members
    to reside in Querious\u201D, with the long term objective being the complete termination
    of the Firmus Ixion alliance.  \nThe fight, however, will surely be one of attrition,
    since FIX has already recaptured a number of its stations, and its leadership
    is quite confident, stating that \u201CFIX is secure and will withstand\u201D,
    adding that all of its residents were ready to defend their homes and families.
    \n\nNeighbouring alliances, for their part, are watching with interest, some even
    taking an active role in the conflict.  \nAllies to the SA count the Huzzah Federation
    \u2013 who have been helping them from the start, and are still holding one of
    the stations in Catch \u2013 and the Kaos Empire, who have been reported to fly
    alongside them.  \nWhen asked about the issue, FIX preferred to remain vague,
    stating that they are \u201Cperfectly happy to speak to any entity regarding the
    establishment of peaceful relations\u201D, but they would not comment on any specifics.
    \n\nIt is worth noting that this is not the first time that both alliances have
    gone to war against each other. The same corporations that now form the Stain-
    Alliance were leading during the first confrontation under the name of Stain Empire.
    This confrontation was resolved peacefully. However, MASS \u2013 then Executor
    Corporation of the SE \u2013 withdrew from the alliance shortly after, raising
    speculation as to the real reasons behind this second war, and the terms of the
    first peace treaty."
