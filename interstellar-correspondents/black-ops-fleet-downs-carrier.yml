    , Curse** \\- Dirt Nap Squad [D-N-S], a corporation specializing in clandestine
    warfare, proved that a Black Ops lead fleet can effectively infiltrate and inflict
    severe losses deep into enemy space when they successfully engaged and destroyed
    an Archon-class carrier with a completely covert fleet.  \n  \nWith a variety
    of stealth bombers, recon ships, and a lone Widow, a 20-man fleet stalked and
    destroyed an Archon-class carrier owned by Elite Aeronautic Developer Syndicate
    while they were reportedly in the process of taking down a control tower. The
    Archon was apparently in system to assist in ship removal from the tower, and
    was caught outside the safety of the tower's shield when tackled by the initial
    D-N-S ship. Despite the active smartbombs fit on the carrier, the smaller craft
    were able to keep the carrier from being able to enter the shield.Cadollan, the
    pilot of the Archon destroyed in the attack, was unavailable for comment.  \n
    \ \nThe effectiveness of the black ops battleships, and the usefulness of stealth
    bombers have been debated for some time. Dirt Nap Squad's CEO, DNSBLACK, stated,
    \"We took a ship that no one wanted and made it the cornerstone of our corp.\"
    Arguably one of the least-used Tech 2 ships, at least this one corporation feels
    they are putting them to good use.  \n  \nOne strategy that Dirt Nap Squad has
    used, according to DNSBLACK, is to send out \"Hunter Killers\" to identify potential
    targets. These \"hunters\" use covert ops or recon ships that can make use of
    the covert cynosural field generator. \"The hunter finds a target, tackles it,
    lights a covert cyno, then the rest come in and have at the target.\" With the
    significant amount of damage that a torpedo-fit stealth bomber fleet can produce,
    supported by EWAR-fit Recon ships, it is easy to imagine that few ships could
    withstand such a barrage.  \n  \nThe critical aspect appears to be the ability
    of the black ops ship to be able to lock onto the covert cynosural beacon and
    be used as a jump bridge for other covert vessels. With this capability, a fleet
    can easily stage far from the action, in a safe location, until the target is
    identified and tackled. Once a target's ability to get away has been removed,
    the Black Op fleet can be dropped in to finish the job.  \n  \nThe successful
    engagement with and destruction of the Archon-class carrier by a fleet of 20 may
    prompt others to re-evaluate the effectiveness of the covert ops/black ops class
    of ships.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Dirt Nap Squad Killboard - Archon Kill](http://killboard.dirtnapsquad.net/?a=kill_detail&kll_id=8510)\n\n*
