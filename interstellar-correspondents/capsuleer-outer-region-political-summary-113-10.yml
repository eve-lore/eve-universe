- body: "YC 113.10.01 - YC 113.10.31  \n  \nThe situation this month was similar to
    September; whilst most sovereignty warfare occurred in the Catch region, Delve
    saw the highest level of ship losses. In Catch, further stations were lost by
    Against All Authorities (AAA) and their allies to the attackers, though AAA were
    able to re-secure multiple systems  after losing them, namely N-8BZ6, YHN-3K and
    AOK-WQ.  \n  \nFighting in Delve has reached new heights, with 20,678 capsuleer
    vessels destroyed there this month. This is the highest level of conflict within
    Delve since the famous disbanding of the \"Band of Brothers\" alliance and the
    subsequent war for the region in February 2009, which saw an incredible 34,840
    kills.  \n  \nThe capsuleer alliance Goonswarm Federation this month embarked
    on a new campaign with a significant twist. This campaign is primarily aimed at
    disrupting any attempts to mine the ice products needed to maintain Gallente starbases.
    This has involved going into combat with police forces within empire borders,
    with CONCORD being forced to ensure that almost 4,000 vessels could not cause
    any further harm to innocent capsuleers.  \n  \nWhilst DED has reported on various
    statistics regarding the extremes of combat levels, several requests have been
    received for some information on the opposite; where is the least hostile? This
    month, we are declassifying the numbers for the total losses for null security
    regions with the lowest numbers of losses since the beginning of YC110. The five
    regions with the lowest numbers of recorded losses are:  \n  \n<table>  \n<tr>
