- body: "SCALDING PASS. After months of resisting the south-eastern coalition with
    guerrilla tactics, the Red Alliance (RA) has finally started recovering some of
    its territories. \n\nWhat started as a lone effort in Cache against the E.R.A
    and UCC alliances has since spread to the neighbouring regions with the help of
    former allies and newfound friends. \n\nThe first to join in and assist was GoonSwarm.
    \n\nAfter its attempt on the Outer and Cloud Ring regions, GoonSwarm moved south,
    leaving its historic home of Syndicate to forge an uncanny relationship with the
    Red Alliance. \n\nNot much has transpired from the association, with the only
    commentary given by nync, a senior officer with the Red Alliance, that they are
    \u201Cworking very closely,\u201D and that both parties were very happy of the
    outcome. \n\nThe pair was then joined by Imperium Alliance and the Tau Ceti Federation
    shortly after, both of which have common history with the Red Alliance. \n\nThis
    loose union translated into a multi-front war against the coalition, whose first
    victim were the Knights Of the Southerncross (KOS). \n\nExpanding from Cache,
    the united forces of the RA and GoonSwarm pressured KOS into asking for a truce
    in order to withdraw from the Wicked Creek region and from the conflict; a move
    that was not appreciated by the coalition, who then [declared war on its former
    allies](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=415745).
    \n\nFocus then shifted to Veritas Immortalis\u2019 (-V-) territories, with Imperium
    Alliance operating in the Great Wildlands, and the rest of the union in its other
    regions, -V- was hard-pressed into regrouping to the Scalding Pass region, as
    explained by Bjoern Bitter, newly appointed Executor of the alliance: \u201CWith
    increased pressure on Scalding Pass we decided it was necessary to pull most,
    but not all, corporations back to Scalding Pass,\u201D in order to \u201Cdefend
    the two Outposts we built,\u201D namely those in RYC-19 and KZFV-4. \n\nWhile
    it has lost some of its regions, the coalition remains strong, with most of the
    original alliances and corporations still in place, and still on the frontlines.
    \n\nLotka Volterra (LV), for its part, is seeing lighter incursions into its territory
    with some skirmishes occurring around the Detorid region, but the frontlines can
    shift abruptly, as demonstrated by the recent incursions on some of LV\u2019s
    caretaking alliances by the Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate in the Immensea
    region. \n\nRefusing to make a statement on possible plans to recover the territory
    lost by the coalition, Chowdown was however willing to comment on the war he calls
    \u201Ca fight of good against evil.\u201D \n\n\u201CThey key systems, as it currently
    stands, are RYC-19 and KZFV-4 \u2013 this is where all the starbase warfare is
    taking place.\u201D He explained. \u201CRegardless of the area, Scalding Pass
    or Insmother, the majority of fighting takes place over the [union's] claimed
    regions,\u201D he went on to point out. \n\nReiterating Lotka Volterra\u2019s
    unwavering support for its Veritas Immortalis ally, he was quick to downplay the
    role played by the Imperium Alliance or the recently involved Interstellar Alcohol
    Conglomerate, calling both actions nothing more than \u201Csmall charges\u201D
    that had no lasting effect. \n\nHowever, when asked, all parties did agree that
    hope for stability in the regions was delusive; the recurrent answer being that
    resolve was set for war, not peace. \n\nThis pessimistic view is shared by Kep
    Ekatemi, an eminent political analyst from the University of Caille. \n\n\u201CCurrently,
    chances for negotiations and a subsequent peace treaty are but a mirage, since
    both parties have been waging war against one another for too long.\u201D He Explained.
    \n\nFor him, long-drawn conflicts diminish any likelihood of compromise; \u201Chistorically,
    those have rarely been settled peacefully but rather through brute force and one
    party crushing or driving the other one out.\u201D \n\n\u201CIn this case, it
    has been going on for almost a full year, in a war where [espionage, corporate
    theft and sabotage](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=423067)
    are all part of the deal; subsequently I think peace talks at this point are as
    likely as seeing fedos fly.\u201D He jokingly concluded."
