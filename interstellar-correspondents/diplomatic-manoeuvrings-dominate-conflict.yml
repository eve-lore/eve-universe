- body: "NEW EDEN - Although the past week may have been on the quiet side with regards
    major battles, the conflict continues apace. Consolidation has been the watch
    word as both sides reflect upon a tumultuous opening to proceedings. \n\nEven
    if the battlefield was quieter, diplomatic announcements still managed to create
    waves: \n\n_Mercenary Coalition takes Band of Brothers contract_ : \n\nMercenary
    Coalition has officially been contracted by BoB. Last Tuesday it was announced
    that what had prior been the subject of countless rumours, speculation and non-corroborative
    whispers, is now fact. \n\nSeleene, the leader of MC stated that the reasoning
    was purely business, adding: \"We wanted a business partner, not to be someone's
    backyard militia force or Special Forces. Of all the alliances I approached and
    spoke with at that time, only one understood our needs; even more telling, only
    one still exists today. That alliance is Band of Brothers.\" \n\nSome capsuleers
    see this move as only confirming what they already believed, although if MC were
    to be a \u2018lapdog\u2019 they would be a highly paid one! \n\nSeleene added:
    \"We held out hope that some of the leaders of the \u2018Coalition\u2019 would
    at least attempt to see past all of the assumptions and opinions and present us
    with a real dilemma. Yet during this, the absolute height of a chance to possibly
    remove Band of Brothers from power, not one offer was made.\" \n\nMC has had to
    deflect a great deal of criticism from people believing their neutrality was missing
    when dealing with BoB. However, with the universe-wide conflict getting into full
    swing and repeated attacks on their infrastructure, MC decided to make a public
    declaration as to their intentions. \n\nThe past two weeks has seen Coalition
    forces repeatedly making forays into MC space, including attacks on their starbases.
    Seleene stated his belief that there was a political motive behind the attacks,
    saying: \"(We felt)...pushed into this a little. The incessant attacks against
    MC assets served no purpose other than to provoke exactly this response.\" \n\n_ISS
    surrenders to KOS_ : \n\nWith MC's contract with BoB adding some reinforcements
    to their side, the numbers opposing the Coalition dwindled after the news that
    Interstellar Starbase Syndicate had surrendered to Knights Of the Southerncross.
    \n\nAs part of the reparations, ISS gave up their starbases in C3-0YD and KW-OAM.
    \n\nISS\u2019s plans for the future remain unknown. \n\n_War participants growing_
    : \n\nAs the war continues to force capsuleers to pick sides, so an ever increasing
    number of corporations and alliances are drawn into the conflict. Striving to
    keep abreast of them, here are the new additions. \n\nThe changes are: \n\n_Coalition_\n\n
