    Eden, Immensea** \\- A coalition comprised of Aggression. [AGGRO] and Atlas [ATLAS]
    alliances have recently evicted United Legion [UNL] from most of their sovereign
    holdings in the Immensea region, diplomatic sources have confirmed.  \n  \nThe
    takeover took no more than two weeks, with [AGGRO] capsuleers pressing [UNL] from
    the north of Immensea while Atlas locked down the south: \"It worked as hoped
    and [UNL had to] split fleets or couldn't reinforce themselves, as [operations]
    were going on in two different areas at the same time.\", Banlish of [ATLAS] stated.
    \ \n  \nThe war came during a time of internal unrest within United Legion and
    was therefore met with limited resistance. Eve's Prophet, [UNL]'s CEO, recalls
    the first days of the conflict: \"Everything [was] broken... people [were] tired
    from [starbase] wars [and] the last CEO retired from [UNL] just before [AGGRO]
    came... Nobody wanted to fight.\"  \n  \nThe delicate situation was well known
    by [UNL]'s enemies. Following the invasion, [AGGRO]'s CEO said: \"[We] had heard
    stories that [UNL] was having [financial] problems and the time was right to push.\"
    \ \n  \n[UNL] resisted the assault for awhile, employing stealth bombers and battleship-heavy
    fleets whenever possible. Banlish describes his former opponents: \"[UNL], despite
    what people think of them are good fighters and they did attempt a defense...
    they did stubbornly fight for many systems and used guerilla tactics quite effectively.\"
    \ \n  \n[AGGRO] experienced some setbacks as well. During one operation, they
    lost 2 motherships to a \"neutral\" fleet comprised of KrautbreaK, Karma and Cult
    of War capsuleers. \"We [were] shooting some towers and were noticed, so [they
    dropped] a big cap fleet on us: we had 4 [motherships] on the field, 2 of them
    were saved, and 2 lost. We all took it well, hotdrops are very common now.\" said
    5n4keyes describing the event.  \n  \nDuring the last phases of the war, [UNL]
    moved most of their assets to the H-ADOC system and are now in the process of
    re-organizing.  \n  \nConcerning [UNL]'s future, Eve's Prophet said: \"We'll fly
    in Curse for some month, [We] need to change everything in [the alliance] now:
    new rules, maybe new corps. Plans are big and [we] really want to fight back...
    We lived [in Immensea] from our start, it is like a historical place for us.\"\n\n*
