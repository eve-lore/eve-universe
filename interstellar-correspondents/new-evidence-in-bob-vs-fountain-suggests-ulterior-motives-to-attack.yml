- body: "Bitter fighting erupted in the Fountain Alliance Sovereign space this Sunday
    between the forces of the FA and a coalition of corporations calling themselves
    BoB, which amongst others, includes Arcane Technologies, Reikoku and most notably,
    Evolution.   \n  \nAs was reported earlier, Sunday saw the beginning of bitter
    fighting between the former allies, Evolution and the Fountain Alliance.   \n
    \ \nThis was an extremely unexpected move. The FA had allowed Evolution members
    free access to their resources and unrestricted travel around their claimed regions.
    Because of this, all of the Fountain Alliance corporations had set good standings
    towards Evolution, marking them out as blue on pilot UI\u2019s. The fact that
    FA pilots were being attacked by seemingly friendly forces caused some tremendous
    confusion for pilots.   \n  \nThe cause for this conflict has been the destruction
    of Shirak\u2019s ship by a Fountain Alliance member. Shocking new evidence however,
    suggests that it was Evolution that opened fire first. The destruction of Shirak\u2019s
    ship was according the fountain spokesperson TornSoul self-defence. Although the
    Fountain Council is at a loss regarding why BoB decided to attack, given the current
    tense situation, it would be unwise to speculate on a motive.   \n  \nShrike,
    the public relations officer for BoB neither confirmed, nor denied the allegations.
    She was only willing to say that the attack was a result of the death of the aforementioned
    Evolution pilot, at the hands of the FA fire, a fact which cannot be disputed
    as both sides confirm the event.   \n  \nWhatever other underlying causes there
    may be for these hostilities, it has been made blatantly clear that Evolution
    will not back down in the face of FA politics or firepower. To quote Shrike:   \n
    \ \n\u201CFA is NOW our enemy, and we WILL engage them. When and where we choose\u201D."
