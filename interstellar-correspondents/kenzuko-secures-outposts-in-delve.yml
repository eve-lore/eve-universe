- body: "**J-LPX7, Delve** \\- Corporations formerly registered under the umbrella
    of the Band of Brothers identity have reformed inside KenZoku, a previously unknown
    alliance that existed to house certain Reikoku industrial assets.\n\nThe KenZuko
    alliance currently houses 19 corporations, including several previously registered
    under the Band of Brothers identity: Evolution, Reikoku, Black Nova Corp, FinFleet,
    Tin Foil and Destructive Influence.\n\nKnuck, a Reikoku Director, explained to
    the Interstellar Correspondents where KenZuko alliance - previously almost completely
    unknown to the capsuleer population - came from.\n\n\"KenZoku as an entity already
    existed to house some industrial assets of RKK and a few affiliates... I don't
    believe the alliance was intended for this particular contingency, but it suits
    the purpose just fine. All the member corps are here, that's the important thing,
    and that is largely what defines us as an alliance.\"\n\nAs the corporations from
    Band of Brothers joined KenZuko, their control towers, still claiming sovereignty
    for their alliance, transferred into KenZuko too, and so did their claims. At
    12:00 on 06.02.111, territorial maps changed as drastically as they had the day
    before, showing KenZuko holding a basic claim of ownership over much of Delve
    and Querious.\n\nThis basic claim is enough to render their outposts safe from
    attack until such a time as KenZuko's sovereignty over the solar systems in which
    the outposts reside is broken, but KenZuko must continue to hold the space for
    a considerable time before their former jump bridge arrays and cyno jammers can
    be reactivated, and it could be months before their capital ship assembly arrays
    can once again begin producing titans and motherships.\n\nBut it is those very
    capital production assets on which Goonswarm seem to be focusing their attacks.\n\nWhile
    only one tower has been lost outright (due to lack of strontium clathrates - the
    fuel a control tower requires to sustain its reinforced mode of operation), Knuck
    revealed that:\n\n\"Several of our capital assembly starbases have been placed
    into reinforced mode in the J-LPXA and QY6-RK solar systems. There were [also]
    some medium-sized skirmishes between us, KIA Alliance, and GoonSwarm earlier today
    that ended, shall we say, rather favorably for us.\"\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Interstellar
