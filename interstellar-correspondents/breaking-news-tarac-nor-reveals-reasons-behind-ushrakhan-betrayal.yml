    Providence  -** Tarac Nor has spoken for the first time since he was named as
    the capsuleer behind the Ushra'Khan [UNITY] disbanding.   \n  \nSpeaking exclusively
    to the Intersteller Correspondents, Tarac Nor stated: \"Right now, Ushra'Khan
    is under new management.\"   \n  \nWith members of UNITY accusing him of doing
    it for ISK, Tarac suggested there were other reasons: \"The ISK was a big motivation,
    but I can't say it was the only motive... I was getting bored with the alliance.
    Very few were active in the executor corporation and I suppose in the end I wanted
    to see how far things could go. I have to stress though, this wasn't meant to
    be personal.\"   \n  \nTarac described his action as a natural progression for
    UNITY as he believes a lot of their good corporations have already left. He did
    reveal a soft spot for his former UNITY wingmates however: \"It will be interesting
    to see how the [capsuleers] who were left move on. I hope they can move on.\"
    \  \n  \nIn closing he revealed there was an offer of a position for him for the
    near future: \"I've been presented a position in HYDRA which looks like it could
    be fun. I think that's all I can really say for now.\"   \n  \nHYDRA have previously
    stated a wish to see Providence restored to CVA, which may seem odd to some, given
    the two alliances' former hostile status. But the NRDS (Not Red, Don't Shoot)
    Providence under CVA was regarded by many of the more piratical forces in New
    Eden as a sort of hunting preserve - an area rich in targets and resources where
    they were guaranteed to see combat.   \n  \nCVA's allies are [already urging them
    to shun making any alliance with HYDRA](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eveonline.com%2Fingameboard.asp%3Fa%3Dtopic%26threadID%3D1358565)
    while Ushra'Khan's old allies are changing their standings towards the UNITY ticker
    - many for the first time in years.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events
