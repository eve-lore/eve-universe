- body: "In a further turn of events, ships, which had formerly been appearing within
    the Ihatalo constellation near the Paala system, re-appeared last night much closer
    to the central Hub systems within the region. The perpetrators of the act are
    again the mysteriously named \u201CliosH riesunS\u201D corporation, who have been
    randomly attacking pilots an pirates such as Kyogen Steiner for weeks now.   \n
    \ \nLast night they attacked again near the Osmon system, without provocation
    and again CONCORD ships took no action to rectify the situation. The attacks continued
    for two hours, before they all mysteriously disappeared once again into space.
    \  \n  \nWorryingly, these attacks are drawing closer and closer to the hub systems
    in and around \u201CThe forge\u201D. CONCORD officials are worried about what
    might be happening and have put all of their ships on high alert within and around
    the region, to be vigilant in capturing these ships for questioning.   \n  \nThose
    who have come into contact with the pilots are urged to stay away, unless they
    think there is a possibility they can capture one of the pilots for questioning."
