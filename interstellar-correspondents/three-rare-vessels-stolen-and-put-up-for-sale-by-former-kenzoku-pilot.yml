    to be worth about half a trillion ISK.[![Raven State Issue Taken By F90OEX](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3395/rsi-imagethumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3395/rsi-image.png)
    \ \n  \nThe rare battleships feature unmatched attack and defence capabilities
    and were originally awarded to the Band of Brothers Alliance, now known as KenZoku,
    as reward for winning the third alliance tournament.  \n  \nAccording to Darax
    Thulain, a former member of KenZoku, SFShootme had been entrusted to move numerous
    alliance assets out of Delve.  \n  \nDarax confirmed he had used SFShootme's courier
    service several times and without incident: \"All that went fine, and he probably
    moved countless [items],\" he said, explaining that SFShootme's betrayal was completely
    unexpected.  \n  \n\"I was pretty well trusted and had been them with them for
    years,\" confirmed SFShootme, adding that he had never really been interested
    in ISK up to the moment he was tasked to move the precious vessels. \"There's
    a difference for me between a few billion and half a trillion,\" he admitted.
    \ \n  \nA few days after the theft, the vessels have already found their way to
    the market. One of the Raven State Issues is being auctioned by SFShootme himself,
    while the other has reportedly been 'appropriated' by F90OEX, a well known industrialist,
    during another auction.  \n  \nActing as a third party transfer agent, F90OEX
    won the Raven State Issue auction on behalf of capsuleer JACKIE M00N. However,
    once he received the ship from SFShootme, F90OEX decided to give it back to it's
    rightful owner KenZoku and refund JACKIE M00N the ISK; essentially 'stealing'
    it back from the original thief.  \n  \nFinally, the remaining Tribal Tempest
    is currently being featured as top prize in a lottery held by SFShootme's representative
    who goes by the name of Ceralio.  \n  \n\"I have good hopes of reaching my minimum
    amount of required tickets,\" said SFShootme, adding that a Tribal Tempest is
    the ship a lot of capsuleers have dreamed of: \"[it] should draw a huge audience,\"
    he concluded.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events in this article? Do you
