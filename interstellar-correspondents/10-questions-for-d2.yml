    of the founding corporations of Dusk and Dawn. Dusk and Dawn (D2) is a large alliance
    based out of Branch and situated within the northern regions. D2 is known for
    their extensive diplomatic and industrial tactics, as well as being fierce fighters
    for their claimed space. Recently, great events have occurred surrounding D2 as
    their alliance numbers have varied and wars have sprung up.\n\n  \n  \n**IC:**
    What was the outcome of your assault into BoB space?   \n**D2:** If you're talking
    of our trip to the Serpentis Fountain Regions, it was the exploration of this
    territory, further education for our pilots, and the most important part, the
    entertainment of our alliance population.   \n  \n**IC:** How does the loss of
    3 corporations and a titan affect your ability to fight in this war?   \n**D2:**
    There is a war? Last I saw outer space is always in a state of war.   \n**IC:**
    I was referring to the War between the Coalition and the Alliance   \n**D2:**
    I don\u2019t think there is a coalition or an alliance if you prefer to call it
    so; I would see it more as movement of different interest of different groups.
    Some fight for glory, some for their entertainment, others fight for their masters.
    \  \n  \n**IC:** The northern alliances have always been very friendly to each
    other. How have IRON, MM, and RAZOR contributed to D2 during these times of war?
    \  \n**D2:** We were and we will always be loyal to each other, it\u2019s a matter
    of long-term relationships and respect for each other. This is something special,
    most of capsuleer alliances do not have the luck to experience this by their own.
    \  \n  \n**IC:** How has D2 responded to Triumvirate's claim to Venal?   \n**D2:**
    Venal is traditionally home by the Guristas Faction and because of this they have
    to reply in such matters. It was always policy by Dusk and Dawn not to interfere
    in politics of other alliances and factions.   \n  \n**IC:** How is your war for
    Fade progressing?   \n**D2:** In the last few weeks, some misguided alliances
    have decided to attack the innocent inhabitants from Fade. But this is something
    I can\u2019t further explain because it would lead into details of our ongoing
    alliance business, which could lead to the creation of additional innocent victims.
    \  \n  \n**IC:** I can understand that, How are you working together with your
    southern allies?   \n**D2:** If you're referring to the south east capsuleer population,
    well, the past showed we share similar interests. As you know they live on the
    other side of the universe, and they show their success in their own ways to reach
    their goals.   \n  \n**IC:** Knowing that the Alliance puts great emphasis on
    espionage, how have you prepared yourself for fighting your enemies?   \n**D2:**
    The majority of our population still believes in honour and pride. So our espionage
    is traditionally limited. We prefer to get our fights on the battlefield. We know
    some alliances don\u2019t fight without knowing everything about their enemy,
    infiltrating their [communications] their families, but in Dusk and Dawn such
    things have always had a bad sound. And this is one of the most important points
    of Dusk and Dawn, their [pilots] stay for fair play.   \n  \n**IC:** How does
    wartime have an influence on D2/TRUST production?   \n**D2:** As I referred earlier,
    it's always a time of war in outer space, so in this sense its not affected. All
    income and production capacity goes direct in the development of our pilots and
    this in different sections.   \n  \n**IC:** How are D2 faring with outposts within
    their space?   \n**D2:** The outposts are a shared property of all corporations
    within our state. This means all income goes in charity programs to benefit the
    whole population of Dusk and Dawn.   \n  \n**IC:** I wish to thank you for your
    time.   \n**D2:** It was a pleasure."
