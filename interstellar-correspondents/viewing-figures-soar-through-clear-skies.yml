- body: "**Out Of The Blue** \\- In recent days a holovid has been broadcasted that
    has shattered the markets perception of what makes a popular holoreel. Traditionally
    reels created for GalNet broadcast or for streaming to in-capsule systems have
    focused around frantic action and explosions. This has now changed with the arrival
    of **Clear Skies**. \n\nIn development over a course of nearly two years, a small
    documentary team followed John Rourke and his crew as they went about their business
    onboard Clear Skies, a tempest class battleship. Often putting their lives at
    risk, the documentary team followed the highs and lows of the crew through battles,
    missions and their infrequent spare time. \n\nAfter painstaking editing the team
    released a pilot episode to gage the public's reaction to this new type of docu-drama.
    The result? An amazing success. Viewing figures on GalNet alone have not stopped
    climbing since release and the broadcasting authorities have struggled to cope
    with the influx and strain on their systems. \n\nOn the original GalNet announcement,
    praise is being heaped upon the crew and the documentary team. One of the many
    comments is from popular holoreel director Cown who remarks that the video is
    \"impressive.\" Rourke himself admits to being \"flabberghasted and boggled\"
    by the overwheming response and remarks that he \"..can't say anything that I
    haven't said already, so I'll re-iterate my deepest thank you's for all the kind
    words!\" \n\nMany are now eagerly awaiting the confirmation that more episodes
    will follow, however until such time arrives, the broadcasters will continue to
    repeat this unique programme. \n\n* * *\n\n_External GalNet References_  \n[Original
