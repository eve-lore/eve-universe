    Tribute** \\- An ATLAS Leviathan-class titan was destroyed by a Northern Coalition
    force of more than 400 ships drawn from over 20 alliances during early morning
    fighting on 12.05.112.   \n  \nH-W9TY is the capital system of Morsus Mihi, a
    major Northern Coalition alliance and the current apparent focus of the Southern
    Coalition invasion effort, which is meeting very heavy resistance.   \n  \nSources
    from both sides confirm that the ATLAS titan was safely within a control tower's
    shields when an incoming Revelation dreadnought collided with it, causing it to
    drift outside the protective bubble.   \n  \nNC forces quickly warped in and engaged
    the unprotected ship. The titan's pilot, Beehatch, attempted to return to his
    protected position as the Northern Coalition forces; the titan managed to make
    it back inside the tower's shields but then [apparently suffered a second collison](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rifterdrifter.com%2F2010%2F05%2Fthings-are-heating-up-in-h-w9ty%2F)
    and continued to drift until it was exposed again.   \n  \nFour Southern Coalition
    carriers allegedly made it to the scene and attempted to repair the titan as it
    came under the focused fire of the entire assembled NC fleet and were themselves
    trapped and destroyed after the Northern Coalition fleet finished off the ATLAS
    Leviathan.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[ATLAS Battle Record](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.atlas-alliance.com%2Fkillboard%2F%3Fa%3Dkill_detail%26kll_id%3D179906)
