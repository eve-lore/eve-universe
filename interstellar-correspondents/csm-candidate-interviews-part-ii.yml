    hours left in the CSM elections, this may be the last chance for voters to learn
    a little about the candidates.  \n  \nInterstellar Correspondents asked candidates
    several questions in order to better understand who they are; where do they live?
    What do they do? What qualifications do they have? Some of the candidates are
    very serious while others take a lighter view of the universe we live in. Here
    are their stories:  \n  \n **Issler Dainze**  \n  \nIssler Dainze spends most
    of her life in lowsec and is \"interested in seeing lowsec made relevant.\" Her
    time is spent managing logistical chains for her industrial corp which produces
    T2 ships. As for her role in New Eden's community, she claims to have driven the
    issue of \"ambulation\" and has served on the CSM twice.  \n  \nWhen asked about
    issues regarding capsuleer governance, she believes that it is \"all but guaranteed
    to be run by the powerblocks that do not represent the majority of New Eden.\"
    As for the CSM's purpose, she believes that the council does influence the future
    and the shape which New Eden will take.  \n  \n **Two Step**  \n  \nTwo Step lives
    mostly in wormhole space. His primary activity is combat, however he also engages
    in \"T2 and T3 production in highsec space.\" He fashions himself one of the \"more
    communicative CSMs out there.\" He believes that this allows him to stay on top
    of issues and complaints.  \n  \nWhen asked about CSM he explains that its role
    is not to \"govern,\" but rather to \"communicate the community's complaints\"
    and propose solutions. He feels that the introduction of corporate bookmarks was
    a direct result of his lobbying.  \n  \n **Elise Randolph**  \n  \nElise Randolph
    is most active in low and nullsec space while maintaining empire research and
    invention operations. She is active primarily in combat situations where she praises
    Red vs. Blue and gives an emphatic \"Go Red!\" She partakes in FCing and has been
    an alternate member of CSM6.  \n  \nAlthough she lacks the support of a \"bloc
    vote\" she believes the current system to be effective. As for the role of the
    CSM she feels that it's work is to \"steer the boat in the right direction.\"
    \ \n  \n **The Mittani**  \n  \nThe Mittani lives in Nullsec space. While logged
    into his Neocomm he is concerned with managing the capsuleers under his command
    and engaging in \"grand strategy, diplomacy as well as espionage.\" He is the
    current Chairman of CSM6 and leader of both Goonswarm and the Clusterf**k.  \n
    \ \nHe feels that the current CSM system is perfectly fine. Believing this, he
    knows that the CSM's impact is \"subtle,\" though effective as a \"lobbying group.\"
    \ \n  \n **corebloodbrothers**  \n  \ncorebloodbrothers is active in nullsec combat
    and claims 3,000 kills to his name. He is also involved with logistical work though
    does his best to maximize his time as an FC and alliance leader. He feels that
    his candidacy \"shows commitment\" as a community leader while also spending time
    in help chats. He quips that while helpful he often feels the urge to \"just spam
    plex for vote scams instead of engaging in meaningful discussions.\"  \n  \nHe
    feels that without the support of a block vote life has been difficult as he has
    been \"ignored by EVE24 and other sites.\" Though he knows there is a vast silent
    majority out there. It is this group of capsuleers with which he hopes to be in
    touch with.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[You can view more about each candidate
