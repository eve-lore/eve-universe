    Issue with a complete set of Republic Fleet issue fittings to the capsuleer community.

    are currently thought to be only four Tempest Tribal Issues in existence, at least
    one of which is owned by Entity, an avid collector of rare ships and other curios.
    \ \n  \nOriginally commissioned by the four ruling tribes of the Republic (Brutor,
    Sebiestor, Krusual and Vherokior), the Tribal Issue Tempests in the hands of capsuleers
    were presented as alliance tournament prizes. The Tribal 'Pest (as it is nicknamed)
    is greatly advanced when compared to the standard-issue Tempest, having:\n\n  \n\n
    \ * an additional low-power slot,\n  * an additional medium-power slot, \n  *
    3,100 MW of additional power grid, \n  * 50 tf more CPU speed, \n  * 8 turret
    hardpoints, as opposed to 6 on a Tempest,\n  * stronger LADAR sensors,\n  * a
    5km longer base targeting range,\n  * a larger capacitor and shorter capacitor
    recharge time,\n  * double the shield capacity and armor and hull-bulkheads almost
    twice as thick as a vanilla Tempest,\n  * 50 Mbit/s more drone bandwidth and \n
    \ * 50 cubic meters more drone bay space.\n\n\n\n  \nTen thousand tickets will
    be sold for 10 million ISK each, with no limit on the number of tickets a pilot
    can buy, by transferring the appropriate sum to Chribba himself with the word
    \"TRIBAL\" in the \"reason\" field for the transaction. A facility is also provided
    wherein participants can [confirm their entries](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Feve-files.com%2Ftools%2Ftribal.dxd).\n\n###
