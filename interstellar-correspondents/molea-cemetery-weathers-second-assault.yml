    cemetery has come under Goonswarm's crosshairs as they were also responsible for
    the destruction of the first cemetery, in Y110.  \n  \nAccording to Azia Burgi,
    the cemetery's caretaker, the tower guarding the 'caskets' came under fire on
    Monday: \"It was about midnight... when around 60 Goon pilots jumped into Molea
    and started attacking us.\"  \n  \n[![Azia Burgi Prepares Cemetery's Defences](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4075/cemeterythumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4075/cemetery.png)Azia
    explained that while three pilots of her corporation were manning defences, Goonswarm's
    pilots used their numbers and their remote repair capability to continue their
    attack virtually unscathed: \"each time we primaried a ship they had 5 Guardians
    backing it up, \" she said.  \n  \nReports indicate that the starbase protecting
    the cemetery was a medium tower of Amarr design. The tower lacked the tough defences
    found in larger ones, but it had been choosen by Azia as a good compromise on
    durability and available burial volume. \"When up against an alliance as large
    as Goonswarm no amount of sentry guns will stop them,\" she explained.  \n  \nThe
    starbase's destruction has not affected Azia's morale. According to her, the 'caskets'
    have mostly remained in place and she has hinted at plans for the cemetery's future:
    \"I will not be bullied... [but] I can't really reveal the actual plans on how
    i plan to rebuild while the war is still active... I am still accepting corpses\"
    she concluded.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Cemetery Information](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1186978)
