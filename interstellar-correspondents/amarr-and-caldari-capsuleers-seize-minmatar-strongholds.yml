    hands and more expected over the next days and weeks.  \n  \nMore than half a
    dozen systems have been taken so far, with early reports suggesting that Damar
    Rocarion and Bad Messenger are the leaders behind the attacks.  \n  \nJade Constantine,
    spokesperson for Star Fraction, accused Minmatar officials of allowing the attacks
    to happen: \"I have personally seen enemies of the Matari people capturing complexes
    in Matari space while Republic Navy assets refuse to fire on them or prevent the
    capture.\"  \n  \nAt the time of writing, Minmatar strongholds are continuing
    to fall with little to no organized resistance.  \n  \nThe Interstellar Correspondents
