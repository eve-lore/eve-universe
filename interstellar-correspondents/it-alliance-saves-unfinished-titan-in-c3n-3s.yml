    **C3N-3S** , On 12.12.112 over 1,500 pilots engaged in battle over a starbase
    that had become a regional target of opportunity. The starbase is the home of
    a titan construction project run by IT Alliance.  \n  \nTitan construction takes
    months and requires a starbase to carry out the assembly operations. The starbase
    in C3N-3S is currently building a titan for Lady Scarlet and was put into reinforced
    mode earlier this week.  \n  \nIT Alliance recalled much of their capital fleet
    from Catch to defend the starbase.  \n  \nThe battle involved more than 1,500
    capsuleer; 600 of them IT Alliance. The opposition force of about 900 pilots was
    an \"opportunity alliance\" including the Deklein Coalition, Red Overlord and
    Against All Authorities.  \n  \nIT Alliance fielded about 90 logistics carrier
    along with 10 titans and 30 motherships.  \n  \nDue to the cynosural jamming in
    effect in C3N-3S, the opposition fleet chose to bring a fleet of Maelstroms and
    Drakes.  \n  \nAs the Maelstrom fleet focused on the tower trying to out damage
    the IT Alliance carriers repairing it, the IT capital fleet slowly knocked them
    down.  \n  \nWhen the battle finally ended, the starbase was still standing and
    it appears the unfinished titan is safe.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the events
