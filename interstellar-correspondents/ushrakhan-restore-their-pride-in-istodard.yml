- body: "The Ushra\u2019Khan were once again under assault this evening in the Istodard
    system, from the mysterious pilots who have been hounding them for the past couple
    of weeks. However this time the outcome was much different to previous encounters.
    \  \n  \nThe pilots had not been in the system for long, scouting around for prey
    before the Ushra\u2019Khan fleet managed to assemble and block the gate which
    was the scene of the fateful encounter only a few nights previously. When the
    stage was set the two fleets met, but a completely different act was played out.
    \  \n  \nAccording to the fleet commander, Maggot described their tactics, \"we
    opted to use a large number of disposable ships in this battle, our losses were
    more than acceptable.\" The size of the Ushra\u2019Khan fleet, estimated at over
    30 ships of mixed classes completely tore into the 10 Angel Tyrants, who were
    seemingly completely unprepared for the aggression they were presented with. Pilots
    who are prepared and expecting to loose their ships for the good of their fleet
    have been regarded as some of the most dangerous pilots in history. This engagement
    was not an exception.   \n  \nWhen the battle was over, and the wreckage had dissipated
    figures of the battle were taken. At least 3 tempests, several cruisers, 3 breachers
    and an interceptor were destroyed on the defending side, whilst the 10 attacking
    pilots were completely destroyed and in several cases were podkilled.   \n  \nSpeaking
    in a triumphant atmosphere after the battle, Maggot said \"I hope we have delivered
    a clear message to whoever is behind these attacks, and we look forward to further
    response or communication from the perpetrator or sponsor.\" The pilots celebrating
    on the field of victory were also echoing Maggots sentiments, talking about their
    satisfaction in wiping out the threat after the pilots had left before their main
    fleet could engage them on the last occasion.   \n  \nThe victory is still being
    celebrated, but whether it is to be the final engagement in a still mysterious
    state of affairs is something that no-one can comment on."
