- body: "CURSE. News reports from the border stations tell of a new group of hostile
    pilots attacking wayfarers and residents in this traditionally notorious area
    of space.   \n  \nThe hostile pilots, identified as members of the Dark Angels
    Corporation, were first sighted around the Utopia and HLW-HP solar systems last
    Sunday, apparently roaming the area attacking all ships in their path with no
    clear provocation or cause.   \n  \nThose who encountered the group, allegedly
    numbering in five vessels, reported that they did not respond to hails or contact
    attempts. A civilian transport captain, who narrowly escaped after being attacked,
    spoke to the Interstellar Correspondents about his ordeal. \u201CI picked up a
    distress broadcast in HLW-HP but the signal was all garbled like their comm. arrays
    were damaged. All I could make out were the words \u2018dark angel\u2019 and \u2018ghosts\u2019.
    When I went to investigate the source those ships were waiting for me and attacked
    without warning! I barely made it out of there in one piece.\u201D   \n  \nThough
    the details are unclear, reports indicate that a Jericho Fraction's Blackbird-class
    Cruiser and a Legio Nova Invicta's Interceptor were the only confirmed casualties
    of the seemingly random attacks, though several civilian vessels have been reported
    missing in the area since the weekend.   \n  \nAfter an initial skirmish, the
    hostile crafts were eventually hunted down and destroyed in the CL-85V solar system
    by a capsuleer force of around twenty vessels, primarily consisting of Legio Nova
    Invicta pilots. No Dark Angels representative could be contacted for comment after
    the battle, and the pilot's motivations remain a mystery"
