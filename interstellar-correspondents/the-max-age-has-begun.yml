- body: "Band of Brothers has initiated an operation they call \u201CMaximum Damage\u201D,
    or the \u201CMax Age\u201D for short. In the first of four planned deployments,
    Shrike has led the first team of over 350 capital ships and 600 support ships
    into a staging area in Saranen, Lonetrek. Once all four deployments have been
    completed, they will work in concert to sweep through the Northern regions laying
    waste to everything they can. As Shrike told us, \u201CThe capital age is here.
    We just moved 350 capitals 50 light years in 2 hours, nothing is safe\u2026 everything
    burns.\u201D \n\n[![Capitals Jumping](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2256/capjumpsthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/2256/capjumps.png)\n\nIn
    preparation for this massive undertaking, Shrike said; \u201CThe last 6 months
    have seen a total halt on [accepting] new allies. No new allies will be added,
    [and] the ones that have stayed with us will remain. \n\nWe have our own home,
    Delve, Querious, and Period Basis. [They\u2019re] well protected, and in no danger.
    Jump Clone [technology] makes it easy for us to switch focus in 2 hours\u2026
    wherever we can Jump Clone, we can attack in a very short amount of time.\u201D
    \n\nTen Titan class ships took part in today\u2019s deployment. Shrike estimates
    that the Band of Brothers assault force will contain at least a total of 20 Titans.
    The remaining deployments are expected to occur over the next twenty four hours
    and actual combat operations to occur shortly after. \n\nPromu, a Fleet Commander
    with Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate, had some mixed feelings about the operation:
    \u201CI don\u2019t see it will change much. I don\u2019t think BoB will look for
    more space now; I believe we will just see MAX fleets on a regular basis\u2026
    maybe \u2018once a week, coming to a system near you\u2019 kinda thing. It might
    make alliances a bit more cautious on making full out attacks to take sovereign
    space though, knowing they could be on the receiving end of 1000 BoB [pilots].
    But like Shrike says, everything burns. IAC are king of spirits. We know how to
    burn things [too]. Maybe one day we will have Shrike tackled long enough to burn
    him. We will fight. Win lose or draw, IAC will fight as long as there are ships
    in our bays.\u201D"
