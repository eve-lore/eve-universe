    from the Northern Coalition (NC) and Deklein Coalition (DC) have invaded the Solar
    System 6VDT-H within the region of Fountain.**   \n  \n[![](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4370/italliancestationwithin6vdt-himagethumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F4370%2Fitalliancestationwithin6vdt-himage.png)IT
    Alliance, sovereignty holders of 6VDT-H, came under attack from Northern Coalition
    and Deklein Coalition forces on 27.01.113 with the system\u2019s combined population
    reaching up to 850 pilots.   \n  \nStation \u2018GVD RKK LITE WAS HERE\u2019 owned
    by Tin Foil Corp, member of IT Alliance, came under fire from hostile forces and
    was placed into \u2018reinforced\u2019 mode at 19:37 New Eden Time.   \n  \nFuzzy
    II, member of the Deklein Coalition alliance Test Alliance Please Ignore, gave
    his opinion on the engagement so far and the future prospects of IT Alliance\u2019s
    residency within 6VDT-H, \u201Ca breakout from IT seemed not thought through much
    though\u201D in response the question about IT alliances future within the solar
    system Fuzzy II commented, \u201Cit won\u2019t surprise you my answer is none.\u201D
    \  \n  \nHulemand, member of IT Alliance, explained that their presence in the
    system was evacuation related, \u201CThe engagement was simply to get as many
    of our ships and pilots out of the currently heavily camped station.\u201D   \n
    \ \nDevilish Ledoux, member of the Deklein Coalition alliance Goonswarm, explained
    the strategic importance of this solar system, \u201CWell, this is/was IT-bloc's
    staging system for their defence of Fountain, and rather than continuing to degrade
    their systems over time, we decided to strike at the heart of their strength in
    the region. It's not a very subtle strategy, but so far, it's been very effective.\u201D
    \  \n  \nWhen asked about IT Alliances defence capabilities, Devilish Ledoux commented
    that, \u201Cthe fight going on right this moment is their first serious attempt
    at a defence, they [IT alliance] appear to be much more interested in escape than
    actual defence at this stage.\u201D   \n  \nA source from within IT Alliance who
    wished to remain anonymous stated that, \u201CIt seems test/goons/DC [Deklein
    Coalition] have had the upper hand all day. Especially seeing as they steam rolled
    through a lot of fountain overnight it seems. IT Alliance seems to have the cash
    to support a long gruelling war while DC seems to be shoring up more numbers on
    a more regular basis. I think IT Alliance will lose 6VDT-H and some more.\u201D
    \  \n  \nAs the engagement continues, there have been over 230 Vessels and 170
    pilots killed within the Solar System from each side. \n\n### GalNet References\n\n[IT
