    founding members suddenly and without warning leave an alliance. This is what
    happened just a few days ago to The Big Blue Alliance. \n\nThe Big Blue Alliance
    was set up shortly after the fall of XECTIC Alliance, set up by a number of the
    largest industrial corporations within the EvE Universe. With the goals of making
    lawless space free for all to live and trade. TBB incorporates not only N.A.G.A.,
    one of EvE largest manufacturers of Tech2 components and ships but also has the
    EvE University. A corporation specifically set up to help new and budding pilots
    in the transition from terra firma to pod pilot. \n\nTBB is clear in its goals,
    Harokas of N.A.G.A. explained; \u201Cthe dictatorial aspect of this alliance is
    only related to the core vision\u201D. He also commented on the leadership stance
    of TBB; \u201Cwhat we have here is a constitutional monarchy.\u201D A stance that
    was to lose them many of its founding member corporations. \n\nRumours reached
    the Interstellar Correspondents news desk on Sunday of last week. The news was
    of trouble brewing inside of TBB and of the malcontent growing within its fragile
    walls. Not 24 hours later the IC reporters were on the scene to find the empty
    seats of the TBB still warm. Almost 50% of the member corporations had terminated
    its allegiances to the TBB. \n\nWhen asked about the mass exodus Harokas played
    down the loses to \u201Cdisagreements on how to conduct decision making regarding
    the TBB\u201D, while he was clear in commenting that: \u201CFacing up this fact
    we talked it down and left there as good friends. While Harokas was humble in
    mentioning that this was the first alliance experience for N.A.G.A, coupled with
    the executor role it choose to take, but \u201Cmistakes were made\u201D he said,
    \u201Cin many aspects of the alliance but that they are moving on and re-evaluating
    their methods.\u201D \n\nThe X-Trading Company, Omega Enterprises and Infinite
    Improbability Incorporated left with a bad taste in their mouths. Ranger, of The
    X-Trading Company spoke out regarding the sudden changes within TBB. He said that
    it was the \u201Cinsurmountable differences with our 3 corps and N.A.G.A, not
    about WHAT we want to do but HOW to do it. Our 3 corps are 100% democratic based,
    while N.A.G.A. thought about another leadership model with them in the leading
    role.\u201D He was seemed to be in an emotional state regarding swift egress when
    he stated clearly; \u201CWe couldn\u2019t accept a dictatorship of N.A.G.A. so
    we decided to leave\u201D \n\nClearly X-Trading felt as if they had been spoofed
    or beguiled by N.A.G.A. who they claim started the TBB under false pretenses.
    He went on to point out that while their visions and goals were the same but their
    paths to those goals were very different. Ranger believes that N.A.G.A. tried
    to use their reputation to turn others into admiring followers, but when N.A.G.A.
    invited a purely combat based corporation into the alliance with the sole goal
    of conquering space for the TBB it was time to leave. \n\nN.A.G.A. have strongly
    stood by its claim that it is a peaceful, neutral entity that does not want to
    \u2018claim\u2019 any part of space, but to open it up to free trade. While the
    leaving corporations did not echo this side of N.A.G.A., it did however have the
    same vision in mind but via a different route. \n\nWhile little evidence has yet
    to be seen of any major moves by TBB to becoming a territorial based alliance?
    If the events of the last few days are to be taken into consideration then a close
    eye needs to be squared firmly on the future moves of the TBB. While the important
    question that is on lips of everyone whenever N.A.G.A. comes under any fire has
    been clarified. Will the prices and availability of N.A.G.A. products suffer because
    of this loss in industrial might? Harokas categorically stated, \u201COf course
    this is a setback, but NAGA & Stepstone catalogue won't be affected at all!\u201D
    A great relief to many out there currently holding order tickets for N.A.G.A.\u2019s
    products. All that is left to see now is if the words of last week come to fruition,
    one way or another?"
