    about GoonSwarm\u2019s \u201CJihadSwarm\u201D; GoonSwarm\u2019s attack on the
    mining community of New Eden. Since that story was reported, TeddyBr FTW, a self
    professed miner and industrialist, has called on the mining community to band
    together and resist the JihadSwarm in a manner best suited for their nature; by
    hiring mercenary corporations to target GoonSwarm pilots throughout New Eden.
    \n\nWith a steady flow of donations coming in, TeddyBr has placed contracts with
    the mercenary corporations R.E.P.O. and TNT. A third mercenary corporation may
    be hired if contributions continue to come in. TeddyBr reports that the mercenaries
    have inflicted over 12 billion isk worth of damage on the JihadSwarmists. Although
    this is a far cry from the number of destroyed mining ships reported by JihadSwarm
    leader Karttoon, TeddyBr still considers this a great start and says: \u201CWe
    miners are getting \u2018our pound of ship\u2019\u201D. \n\nTeddyBr believes that
    the reimbursement policy at Pend Insurance and the Secure Commerce Commission
    needs to be changed. He feels that insurance payouts to JihadSwarmists are an
    insult to the miners and a slap in the face to CONCORD. Although he fears that
    many of the miners being attacked may put down their mining lasers and retreat
    to the safety of terrestrial living, he hopes that the more resolute miners will
    hold their ground and continue to provide donations to the mercenary effort. TeddyBr
    dismisses the entire \"holy\" premise that the JihadSwarm has sworn to. He feels
    that the JihadSwarm is nothing but a publicity stunt by GoonSwarm to hold the
    record of the longest running slaughter of the innocent. \n\nKarttoon, leader
    of the JihadSwarm, tells us that: \u201CWe have already inflicted over 150 billion
    ISK of damage on the infidels. The intelligent have chosen to heed my message
    and vacate to the unholy land, while the remaining will continue to be destroyed
    and at random... podded. I\u2019ve witnessed systems defiled by more than 60 miners
    at a time emptied in a matter of weeks. We have limitless numbers willing to sacrifice
    everything... although there may be decreased activity on occasions, plans are
    in place to ensure we have enough bodies to detonate on the infidels indefinitely.\u201D
    _(Karttoon\u2019s reference to the \u201Cunholy land\u201D is the unofficial formation
    of a safe haven for miners in any of the systems claimed by the Minmatar Empire.
    Full text of the notice can be found in the link at the end of this article.)_\n\nKarttoon
    is not too concerned with the mercenary activity and also had this to say about
    donors to TeddBr\u2019s cause: \u201CThe GoonSwarm GIA has obtained a list of
    miners who have donated, and an internal reward will be placed on the continued
    destruction of their ships and pods unless penance is paid.\u201D _(Penance consists
    of a 100 million isk payment and apology letter sent directly to Karttoon)._\n\n[TeddyBr
