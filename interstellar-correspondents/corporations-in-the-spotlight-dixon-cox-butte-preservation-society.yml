    Cox Butte Preservation Society [.DIX.] was founded by BoodaBooda, former Test
    Alliance CEO.  [.DIX.] is a PVP corporation with an active role in the Psychotic
    Tendencies alliance and an active participant in various alliance operations.
    They are currently based in the Fade region with ongoing operations against other
    residents of the area.\n\n \n\nBoodaBooda describes the current corporation specialties
    as \"covops camping, gatecamping, small gang, reddit posting, and making gorillions
    of isk,\" and elaborated further saying \"Basically if anything in Fade shows
    too much ankle, we kill it.\"\n\n \n\nDespite a need for more capsuleers on the
    front lines, [.DIX.]  recruitment is currently closed with BoodaBooda telling
    us that \"unless you are exceptionally attractive\" there is little chance of
    new capsuleers being accepted into the corporation.\n\n \n\n\"After our Fade campaign,
    recruitment will reopen - we mainly look for people with PVP experience who will
    fit in with our community\". Normally they recruit capsuleers with a minimum of
    8 million skill points with a decent amount of PVP skill. Growth in a capsuleer's
    tactical knowledge base when joining Dixon Cox Butte Preservation Society is practically
    assured.\n\n \n\nTo have your Corporation highlighted in this segment contact
    ISD Jarrett Pelley with your celebrations and events."
