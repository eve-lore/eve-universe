    Heath** \u2013 Teonusude Republic Independent Agency Division [T.R.I.A.D] has
    announced that a capsuleer has reached the highest agency standing available.
    \  \n  \nAxl Borlara has been crowned the first capsuleer in the agency's history
    to achieve the highest standing possible of 10.00, an achievement which T.R.I.A.D
    founder DeT Resprox, was very pleased to announce: \u201CTo reach 10.00 is an
    incredible achievement in itself and shows Axl Borlara's dedication to the cause.
    Axl is now the proud owner of the first ever issued 'T.R.I.A.D Elite' medal which
    is only awarded to those who have reached 10.00 agency standing.\u201D   \n  \nAxl
    described his feelings towards receiving the highest standing and what he did
    to achieve it: \u201CI am somewhat surprised to say the least, but very proud
    of the achievement... The majority has been supply missions via the T.R.I.A.D
    market. The agency has its own fully functioning market. Capsuleers can sell items
    to the agency, gaining agency standing and loyalty points as well as the obvious
    ISK.\u201D   \n  \nWhen asked about capsuleer participation within T.R.I.A.D,
    DeT Resprox stated that \u201Csome campaigns can have up to 30 capsuleers involved.
    These campaigns can last several hours, days or even weeks depending on the objectives.
    In the past month, 137 missions have been taken up\u201D.   \n  \nWith such activity
    within the agency, it is surely only a matter of time before we see more capsuleers
    awarded the \"T.R.I.A.D Elite\" medal.\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[Axl's profile](http://www.triad-eve.net/stationmeminfo.php?portrait=1815300054)
