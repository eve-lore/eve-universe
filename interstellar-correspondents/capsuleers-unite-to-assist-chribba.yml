    Providence. A few weeks ago an eight-man corporation known as Trzciciele Kawy
    planted Sovereignty Blockade Units (SBUs) at all the stargates in the system of
    9UY4-H in Providence. The system is currently the home of Chribba, one of New
    Eden's most beloved capsuleers. Chribba has pledged to keep the station - known
    as Chribba's Cottage - open to the general public for as long as he holds sovereignity
    there, making it rare among capsuleer-owned stations.  \n  \nFollowing the SBU
    placement, a general GalNet alert went out and in a matter of hours, droves of
    pilots descended on the system, ready to defend Chribba's sovereignty.  \n  \nFirst
    to arrive was a mixed fleet from Empire space, composed of pilots who had volunteered
    from the 'Holy Veldspar' comm channel under the leadership of Obsidian Hawk of
    RONA corporation. They were shortly followed by a fleet that had initially formed
    to repel Sansha Incursions in Empire, under the leadership of Rustybronco of The
    Concillium Enterprises corporation.  \n  \nObsidian Hawk's fleet, in stealthbombers,
    started in on the first SBU. They were beginning to despair of ever finishing
    the job when a 120-man EVE-University fleet under the leadership of CEO Kelduum
    Revaan jumped into the system and added their firepower. Rustybronco's Incursion
    fleet had arrived by that time, and the three groups made short work of the first
    SBU.  \n  \nTheir celebration was shortlived however, as a large Northern Coalition.
    (NCDOT) fleet jumped in, pursued by another fleet. A brief three-way battle resulted,
    ending when the other unamed fleet withdrew from the system and the majority of
    the NCDOT force followed them.  \n  \nShortly thereafter NCDOT proceeded to jump
    in several supercapitals - sources are unclear as to whether the cynosaural jamming
    technology protecting the system was destroyed or deactivated by Chribba - and
    made short work of the remaining SBUs with support from the other fleets.  \n
    \ \nUnofficial sources within NCDOT mentioned that they had not originally intended
    to come to Chribba's aid, but had been on a roam in the area when they heard of
    the events in 9UY4-H. No official comment from NCDOT could be obtained.  \n  \nHaving
    accomplished their goal of freeing the system, the fleets from Empire started
    a mad dash back to safety, some having bravely flown to Chribba's defence in clones
    fitted with the very best implants.  \n  \nWhen contacted for comment Chribba
    seemed a little stunned, saying that 'I did not really expect it all to turn out
    the way it did, seeing so many pilots, creating their own fleets, rallying to
    just be a part of things is stunning. Hearing that this was the first time a pilot
    ventured into 0.0, or even acted fleet commander makes it all even so much more
    fun.' He has promised to reward every pilot who contributed to his defence with
    a medal.  \n  \nTrzciciele Kawy could not be reached for comment.\n\n* * *\n\nAre
