- body: "**ENNUR** \u2013 Two freedom fighters from the People\u2019s Front of Minmatar,
    Viqer Fell and Tyto, openly denounced all prospective candidates actively vying
    for power in Amarr during an interview with the Interstellar Reporters, stating
    that they would only recognize a candidate who \u201Csupported the complete and
    total abolition of slavery\u201D within the Empire. The two also openly admitted
    to taking part in a recent series of ferocious ambushes against Amarr targets
    within the Derelik Region (reported by correspondent Lemetar Relem on 23/09/03),
    and lashed out against critics of the attacks who \u201Clack the backbone to stand
    up for their beliefs\u201D. The interview, seen below, is demonstrative of the
    impassioned hatred between the two states that the next Emperor will have to face.
    \n\nWhat is the People's Front of Minmatar's position towards the various candidates
    for the Succession Trials to the Amarr Throne? Let's begin with Jamyl Sarum....
    \ \nT: (spits) Sarum!  \nVF: We like no Amarr Succession candidates.  \nT: If
    the Sarum family accedes the throne, all out war is inevitable.  \nVF: You see,
    any Candidate that stated their intention to free our people during the Succession
    Trials would never take hold, yet that is the only candidate we would choose to
    support. Imagine\u2026an Amarr Succession candidate who supported the complete
    and total abolition of slavery? Never. Thus, we will work to dethrone any so-called
    \u201Cdeity\u201C who rises to power. \n\nAnd what of Doriam Kor-Azor?  \nVF:
    Replace Heideran with another Heideran, pah!  \nT: I think for the \"ordinary\"
    person in space, the change will mean little. We have heard promises of reform
    for years; meanwhile, the Empire protects the status quo. Sarum is dangerous for
    the \u201Cordinary\u201D citizen. \n\nHow so?  \nT: She will destabilize entire
    regions. If the Empire starts to march on her reclamation of their position....
    war will follow, and people will die.  \nVF: For too long have our people been
    belittled and our struggle laughed at by the empires that span the galaxy. Sarum
    gaining power may force the other races to face up to their responsibilities and
    fight with us to rid space of this Amarr curse. Even the Republic classifies us
    as criminals for our actions, preferring to cower at the Emperor\u2019s table
    rather than fight for its own people\u2019s rights! I speak for myself here\u2026
    \ \n\n\nAre your stern grievances directed toward the Amarr citizens, or towards
    the policies of their government?  \nT: The two are inseparable.  \nVF: Both.
    The people of the Empire, through their acceptance of the Emperor, give their
    complicit support of his policies. In this complicit support, they are guilty.
    \ \nT: The average Amarr citizen has earned position or wealth on the backs of
    slaves somewhere along the line. It would appear to me that there are no good
    Amarrians.  \nVF: The only thing that evil needs to win is for good men to do
    nothing\u2026and so far the majority of Amarrians have done just that, nothing.
    \n\nThere have been reports of ambushes on unarmed Amarr convoys and mention of
    'terrorist' type activity in the Derelik region...  \nVF: (interrupting) We cannot
    possibly comment on our operations directly.... \n\nDo you believe these raids
    benefit the cause of the Minmatar in the eyes of the other states?  \nVF: Given
    that we conducted those operations, of course we say \u201Cyes\u201D. \n\nIs that
    on or off the record?  \nVF: On the record. The recent news story has been confirmed
    as relating directly to our operations in that region, although our names were
    not mentioned within the article. You see, if we lie down and do not fight, then
    we become as the Ni-Kunni. The Ni-Kunni are as bad as the Amarr, for they represent
    everything we fight against--the lack of free spirit, and the willingness to let
    another race dominate and enslave. The Amarr find us rather less palatable than
    their previous conquests.  \nT: Being labeled \"terrorist\" by those without the
    backbone to stand up for their beliefs has been the burden of freedom fighters
    throughout history.  \nVF: Freedom is worth all the name-calling. \n\nAre you
    aware that there is growing support for Stavros as a potential candidate for Succession?
    \ \nT: I had heard the name.  \nVF: I was not personally aware of this, as my
    news tends to come from traders and miners who venture away from the safer space
    lanes. \n\nHe is a member of m0o, and there are circles of prominent individuals
    who are actively campaigning for his Succession.  \nT: It is a reflection on the
    state of Amarrian politics when a candidate like this is taken seriously. Apathy
    is a problem in any political system.  \nVF: (laughing) At least everyone would
    know the Emperor is honorless scum then rather than the masquerade we currently
    have. \n\nIn a recent interview, Stavros was quoted as leaning more towards Sarum's
    political objectives for the Amarr Empire.  \nVF: Then he will die as well as
    their last \"god\" did. \n\nIs that for the record?  \nVF: Yes.  \nT: It is clear
    for anyone to see that the Empire is eating itself from the inside. Someone, somewhere
    wanted Heideran dead.  \nVF: It is a reflection of how backward the Amarrians
    are that they still believe this religious claptrap that a man can become a \u201Cgod\u201D
    and that his word is divine. They are no better than the ignorant barbarians of
    our common ancestry. \n\nEmperor Heideran was over 500 years old when he passed...are
    you going to imply on the record that the Emperor's death was not natural?  \nT:
    For the record...I am stating that I believe his death was \"suspicious\".  \nVF:
    Either way, he is dead, and I for one am glad of it. If he needed help being relieved
    of his mortal coil--and I say \u201Cmortal\u201D, not \u201Cimmortal\u201D--then
    good for the assassin.  \n\n\nSo what is the current state of the Rebellion?  \nT:
    The Rebellion for us, or the Rebellion in general?  \n\n\nThe rebellion that is
    the cause of the P.F.M., of course...  \nVF: The Rebellion grows daily, and gains
    momentum with every story of Sarum\u2019s accession, or proposed accession.  \nT:
    Our efforts grow, but I say again, there is apathy in the general populace. They
    have forgotten the dangers and pain caused by Amarr. They languish in multi racial
    corps, believing we are not entitled to our heritage.  \n\n\nDo you feel that
    Heiderans's death helps your cause or gives you some kind of strategic opportunity?
    \ \nT: His death will make our efforts stronger, and when the inevitable war comes,
    more will flock to our banner.  \nVF: The cancer that eats away at the heart of
    the empire will only encourage people to our banner.  \n\n\nIf any of the Succession
    Candidates offered a summit meeting, or proposed an accord to settle differences
    between the two states, would you be receptive to hearing it?  \nT: If it meant
    a conclusion to the issues we fight, then yes.  \nVF: It would really depend on
    the terms. Slavery would have to be on the table, as in ending it outright, no
    questions asked.  \n\n\nEven if it was offered by Sarum?  \nT: If Sarum offered
    to end slavery, then we would have to listen to her. I would be sure I had a warp
    stabilizer equipped, though.  \nVF: As I stated before, any candidate who proposes
    an end to slavery would be supported. But this would be conditional on their not
    enslaving someone else. We would not sit idly by whilst they free our people,
    only to try to enslave the Caldari, for example. Or at least, I would not.  \n\n\nHow
    important do you feel that influence by other states--such as the Caldari or Gallente--affects
    the political situation between the Minmatar and Amarr?  \nT: In political terms,
    I don't think the Amarr fear any diplomatic pressure.  \nVF: I believe they are
    too busy squabbling amongst themselves to be of much influence.  \nT: We do, however,
    receive many messages of support from both Gallente and Caldari pilots.  \n\n\nThat
    was my next question...care to mention names?  \nT: No.  \nVF: I think it would
    be unfair to place them in the spotlight like this.  \nT: We have numerous enemies,
    the support is sensitive information.  \n\n\nI notice you're a bountied man, Viqer.
    \ \nVF: (smiles)  \n\n\nDo you have a message for any bounty hunters that may
    be trying to collect your corpse\u2019s payout?  \nT: Even the corpses of our
    newest members have a market value to some.  \nVF: Yes I do. To them I say I am
    not a pirate! I fight with honor for my people, as our enemies will attest to.
    Hunting me down is only supporting the continued moral abuses suffered by my people,
    and as such I will not hesitate to defend myself.  \n\n\nWhat of those who hunt
    you that are Minmatar themselves?  \nVF: Traitors.  \nT: Misguided fools. This
    is the spiritual home of all Minmatar.  \nVF: As such will be shot like traitors.
    I have never been hunted by a fellow Minmatar, and I do not think any are so misguided
    that they would do so. This bounty is a badge of honor as far as I am concerned,
    a reflection of the hatred the Amarr have for me and the war that I fight. I wear
    it with pride.  \n\n\nGentlemen, I thank you for your time...  \nVF: Thank you
    for your time also.  \nT: Thanks for the opportunity. People must hear what we
    do."
