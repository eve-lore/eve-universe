- body: "Hadean Drive Yards \u2013 one of the oldest Capsuleer-pilot owned corporations
    in the Eve cluster announced earlier this month that it would be returning to
    business after it was forced into closure following a corporate theft several
    months earlier. HDY is known by many for its specialisation in the construction
    of star ships. OverKill \u2013 CEO and Founder of HDY took the time to talk with
    the Interstellar Correspondents about the Corporation\u2019s long history and
    future plans, in an interview that took place last saturday.   \n  \nFounded over
    three years ago, Hadean Drive Yards was built up around the concept of \"military
    protocols and capitalistic ideals\" with the objective of making the corporation
    a household name in star ship construction. OverKill remarked that HDY\u2019s
    \"principle mission statement always was the research and development of advanced
    star ships.\"   \n  \nHe went on to explain how HDY slowly gained a reputation
    for the \"integrity and quality of their product\" and had amassed what he described
    as a fairly impressive array of star ship blueprint originals. When commenting
    on HDY\u2019s pilots, Overkill remarked that members came and went, each of them
    bringing something different to the corporation but leaving with \"what we hope,
    are fond memories for the most part.\"   \n  \nHe added that he thought HDY was
    no better than any of the other successful corporations in New Eden, but quite
    different in many ways. Averring that \"HDY\u2019s ideas, until recently, were
    fairly unique within the EVE universe and that set us apart.\"   \n  \nWhen asked
    to comment on his personal high points of Hadean Drive Yards long history; OverKill
    spoke fondly of what he described as the corporation\u2019s Golden Age, a time
    during which it owned almost every major blueprint in the known universe and \"when
    people requested their ships be made by HDY, even if it meant travelling a few
    extra jumps.\" He added that this Golden Age was a time when HDY\u2019s \"name
    and neutrality meant something, when HDY was able to remain true to her mission
    statement and her members.\"   \n  \nSpeaking of his lowest point as CEO of HDY,
    OverKill talked about the personal and \"massive betrayal\" that he felt he had
    suffered at the hands of trusted members of Hadean Drive Yards who absconded with
    ninety-five percent of the corporation\u2019s assets and attempted to shut the
    corporation down. \"Pilots, who I thought were considered brothers, betrayed both
    me and the ideals they claimed to uphold. A family was torn asunder in the blink
    of an eye and in the middle of the night with subterfuge and strong-arm tactics.\"
    \  \n  \nOverKill went on to comment that although a serious blow had been done
    to the corporation it could have recovered and several members were willing to
    remain with HDY to accomplish this. However he added that \"anger and hate clouded
    my mind and vengeance was something that I had sought. Rebuilding HDY in her true
    form would not have been possible at that time. So, I closed her down.\"   \n
    \ \nOn the subject of revenge, OverKill spoke of how he had used an alternate
    identity to \u201C\"travel down the path of vengeance\" and had been in the position
    to take back a significant portion of the assets stolen from HDY. He explained
    that he had abandoned the plans after a long discussion with a friend, in which
    he came to the conclusion that in carrying out his revenge he would be no better
    than those who had betrayed Hadean in the first place. \"How could I claim to
    lead and uphold the ideals of the Hadean Drive Yards when by the act of revenge,
    I become that which I despise the most?\"   \n  \nConsequently, the Hadean CEO
    chose to divert his energies into what he described as the \"task of resurrecting
    HDY and leading it back to where it had fallen so far from in the past.\" After
    receiving several encouraging communications from former Hadean members he began
    thinking about what it meant to be a member of HDY and \"how we were family\",
    setting plans in motion for the eventual rebirth of the corporation. \"Hadean
    Drive Yards was a dream and no one can kill a dream, regardless of how much they
    might try.\"   \n  \nWhen commenting on organisations that share similar ideals
    as HDY such as the Interstellar Starbase Syndicate, TRUST, and the Big Blue, OverKill
    said \"I'm glad to see that some visionary pilots out there have similar dreams
    to my own.\" Adding when queried, that although it had been discussed HDY was
    \"content to remain neutral\" rather than form a Conglomerate style alliance at
    the present time.   \n  \nIn closing, OverKill remarked that it would be \"a long
    slow uphill climb for HDY but, thanks to the generosity of former clients and
    friends, HDY is slowly coming back from the brink.\" Stating that the corporation
    intended to eventually construct capital class vessels, the CEO affirmed that
    \"HDY has always been able to do what many other larger Corporations could not
    and now is no exception. Analyze, Adapt, And Overcome. We will be there eventually,
    rest assured.\""
