    from the south-eastern regions, a rapid expansion of the [Red Alliance](http://www.eve-online.com/alliances/a_1220922756.asp)
    was witnessed as it both grew in numbers and territory. The new landlords were
    quickly recognised by many of the non-affiliated residents, and a peaceful transition
    was possible in most regions.  \nSome, however, chose to break free and claim
    independence as well as territory, with varied degrees of success. \n\nWhile the
    [Miners With Attitude](http://www.eve-online.com/alliances/a_521381722.asp) managed
    to lay claim to the region of Tenerifis, others were not so successful, such as
    the locals of Detorid ; unprepared and outnumbered, they decided to retreat to
    the safety of Empire space in an effort to reorganise.  \nAn alliance was then
    formed ; the [Chimaera Pact](http://www.eve-online.com/alliances/a_922541302.asp),
    regrouping locals from Detorid and counting veteran corporations such as FinFleet
    and Crisis Corp. Their intentions and objectives were [made public](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=244822)
    early last month, preceded by an attempt to reclaim the 0-W778 solar system.   \nUnfortunately
    for them, the coup did not last very long, and Red Alliance forces managed to
    recapture the station within a few days.  \nSince then, two open wars have surfaced
    between [Chimaera Pact](http://www.eve-online.com/alliances/a_922541302.asp),
    [Red Alliance](http://www.eve-online.com/alliances/a_1220922756.asp) and its ally,
    the [Free Space Alliance](http://www.eve-online.com/alliances/a_995013977.asp),
    spanning from the far reaches of the 0.0 regions to Concord-protected Empire space.
    \n\nI recently had the chance to interview leaders from both factions concerning
    their objectives, and how this conflict affected them.  \nConfirming the relative
    peace in which the territories were reclaimed, Hassis, spokesperson for the Red
    Alliance affirmed that \u2018only Chimaera Pact came to [the] Detorid region in
    an attempt to raise pressure.\u2019 Later asserting that \u2018there were [also]
    some attempts to attack Wicked Creek and Detorid regions, but they were successfully
    reflected\u2019 with help from residents of those regions.  \nWhen asked about
    their projects for the regions under their tutelage, it was pointed out that mutual
    profit was the keyword ; \u2018it will be home for those who want to make profit
    from living in 0.0 and help us fighting [against] our enemies\u2019.  \nYet, these
    objectives are not very different from those accredited to the [Chimaera Pact](http://www.eve-online.com/alliances/a_922541302.asp)
    by Rover Vitesse, CEO of Crisis Corp, who stated that all they wanted was \u2018to
    live in Detorid amongst friends and friendly people.\u2019 According to him, the
    war erupted because \u2018[the Red Alliance] seemed to hold a vendetta against
    the guys who lived here under The Five's ownership.\u2019 \n\nBoth opponents seem
    to be pleased with how events are unfolding, with Mr. Vitesse stating that \u2018[Chimaera
    Pact] are more than happy with the way war is going.\u2019 Hassis was just as
    confident, affirming that the \u2018threat level of this \u201Cinvasion\u201D
    is very low,\u2019 and further embracing a larger scope declaring that \u2018[the
    Red Alliance] can face any threat,\u2019 and that they would adapt to any kind
    of warfare encountered.  \nIt would seem that some equilibrium has been found
    in this conflict, with neither side gaining clear advantage over the other, time
    being the final judge. \n\nThe neighbouring alliances, for their part, do not
    appear interested in taking an active role on either side of the conflict. [Veritas
    Immortalis](http://www.eve-online.com/alliances/a_173739862.asp) has only been
    seen engaging in small skirmishes against the [Red Alliance](http://www.eve-online.com/alliances/a_1220922756.asp),
    while [Ascendant Frontier](http://www.eve-online.com/alliances/a_327815755.asp)
    has its hands full fending off the northern invasion."
