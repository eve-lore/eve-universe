    in his Revelation. That man is Chribba. The same one who has introduced a new
    venture; one he refers to as ['The Love Project'](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=644422).
    A not-so-secret plan involving \u2018love cans\u2019 and now even \u2018love ships\u2019,
    all loaded with high-end industrial gear. \n\nThe first phase involved jettisoned
    canisters known as \u2018love cans\u2019 which were loaded with assorted goods.
    The kit is usually industry related, pertaining to occupations such as mining
    or production. The project isn\u2019t limited to a single region of space, though
    the Amarr controlled region did see the start of it. \u201C...if I happen to cross
    that region you can be certain to find [a love can],\u201D Chribba commented.
    \n\nHe recently started stage two of The Love Project; moving from simply jettisoned
    cans to fully fitted ships. He commented that \u201C[the ship fitting] is almost
    always related to what I love\u201D. A full industrial fitting was reported on
    the first Loveship, \u201CChribba\u2019s Loveship#1\u201D, located in the Amarr
    system outside of the Emperor station. \n\nIt all began with piles of mining laser-related
    blueprints; \u201CI started to jettison a few here and there to roaming pilots\u201D
    stated Chribba. It eventually moved out to include other objects, \u201Cit can
    be anything from blueprints to modules\u201D he said. \n\nThe most anticipated
    prize, however, is to be handed out during the ['LoveQuest'](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=662601).
    The Apocalypse Navy Issue \u2013 nicknamed the Veldpocalypse- is Chribba\u2019s
    tenth Loveship. The Veldpocalypse, estimated to be worth approximately one billion
    ISK, is the grand prize for the LoveQuest, though not the only available prize.
    \u201CThere will be many prizes involved\u2026\u201D said Chribba, mentioning
    the starting point for the competition will be the Amarr system. The fluid router
    channel will be open and active starting Saturday the 22 and will be called \u201CLoveQuest\u201D.
    \n\nAll pilots are welcome to join in any phase of the venture, from casually
    looking for cans in their areas to actively hunting for the elusive Veldpocalypse.
    A good start is to find Chribba; \u201Cthe likelihood of Love near me increases
    by 100% compared to being in deep 0.0\u201D he said. Alternately, you could show
    up in Amarr at about 12:00 Eve Standard Time and join the LoveQuest channel to
    join the hunt for a number of prizes. The formula is simple: find Chribba, find
    love."
