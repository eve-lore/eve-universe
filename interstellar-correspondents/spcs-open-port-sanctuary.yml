- body: "The Bleak Lands - In a private sermon attended by numerous loyalist Amarrians,
    the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Slaves (SPCS) has unveiled \u201CPort
    Sanctuary\u201D. The purpose-built facility is to allow the humane preparation
    of Minmatar slaves and Gallente Initiates before they begin new lives in the Amarr
    Empire.\n\nOccupants of Port Sanctuary are expected to be there for three to four
    weeks undergoing training and conditioning before slaves are sold to approved
    humane Holders and \"Initiates\" are allocated to new mentors to continue their
    training. Its builders hail it as a triumph in the humane treatment of slaves.
    The third facility to be built by SPCS, it was put together through the close
    work of Gaius Vermillion, Archbishop, Lord Murkon, Praetoria Shipyards and some
    14,000 slaves. In all it took nearly four months to construct from start to finish.\n\nArchbishop,
    a member of PIE Inc. and the director of the SPCS explained the purpose of the
    organization; \u201CThe SPCS was founded three years ago. Its purpose was to follow
    the decrees of the Emperor that slaves be treated in a humane manner. Hence our
    name \u2018Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Slaves.\u2019 We discovered
    that taking people directly into the Empire wasn't healthy. They suffered in the
    long Bestower rides, especially with inhumane slavers focused on profit. Instead
    we created the port system to provide a place where they could stop off, get medical
    exams, food, rest, and religious services; as kind of a \u2018primer\u2019 to
    Amarr life. It\u2019s been very successful.\u201D\n\nOne of the main functions
    of the facility is that it will be where Gallente Initiates begin their programme
    to find enlightenment. \"All Gallente Initiates go through screening and sign
    a Contract of Enlightenment before being brought to the port station\u201D explains
    Archbishop.\n\n\u201CThe Gallente Initiate program was started as a way to help
    the Gallente Federations' rejected people. When you travel to the Crystal Boulevard,
    the Federation stations, you see the shiny face they put on to the [...] cluster.
    But delve deeper, a block off the avenue, and you see the despair, drugs, prostitution,
    XXX stores; it\u2019s sad.\n\nSo the Initiates program was designed as a way to
    help bring Gallente who want to turn their life around into an environment where
    this is possible. Some day an Initiate could join CVA [Curatores Veritatis Alliance],
    run an Amarr station, do all sorts of things, it will be hard work but like the
    Ammatar the Initiates have much potential and opportunity.\u201D\n\nThe SPCS is
    of course dedicated to ensuring the humane treatment of slaves, and the issue
    of the Vitoc method of slave control was raised. \"Officially we don't support
    the use of Vitoc en-masse. But we do realize it is a valuable \"aid\" to help
    the Minmatar focus on the task at hand. When a Minmatar is focused on violence
    and escape they're not fulfilling their duties to God and the Empire. But with
    Vitoc\u2019s help, they know they are dependent on the Empire. They thus can focus
    on the important work and ignore those fleeting thoughts of escape and terror\"
    explained Archbishop.\n\n\u201CDo we Vitoc all our slaves? No. Do we Vitoc some?
    On a limited basis where necessary.\u201D\n\nGiven the assurances in place to
    ensure that all slaves sold from this facility go to masters who will treat them
    humanely, the question as to where the slaves were acquired was raised. Archbishop
    explained the situation; \u201CWell despite the claims of the terrorists we don\u2019t
    just back up to Minmatar planets and raid the nursery. We buy slaves from various
    providers inside the Republic and we also have breeding programmes.\u201D\n\nOn
    the legality of this, he continued: \u201CI have my slaves delivered to the border.
    Talk to the Minmatar about their security issues. The SPCS conducts legal operations
    inside Amarrian sovereign space. We don't ask where our slave providers originally
    get their livestock. We can\u2019t control where they come from. But I will say
    if one is not ethical or humane it\u2019s definitely in the slaves\u2019 best
    interest to be sold to the SPCS.\u201D\n\nIn closing Archbishop declared that
    \u201CThe Amarrian Empire was founded on a faith in God and service to its fellow
    man. The SPCS seeks to carry on in that honourable tradition bringing those less
    fortunate by birth to the glory of God and the light of His word.\u201D\n\nThe
    ceremony itself was a short affair, attended by the SPCS, PIE Inc, CVA, Vigilia
    Valeria, Delictum 23216 and other Amarr loyalists. The famous Golden Fleet maneuvered
    to the facility and took up orbit around the main tower. As they did, Archbishop
    commemorated its opening with sermon and a token of Amarrian Wheat being interred
    at the facility to symbolize the first seeds that bring forth a great harvest.
    Then the first Bestower docked with the facility and the first 4,000 Gallente
    Initiates were taken to begin their programme and finally all the witnesses were
    invited back for a reception in the Amarr system.\n\nApart from an attack from
    hostile forces before the ceremony, the entire event concluded without incident.
    The attack itself consisted of Ushra\u2019Khan and Mixed Metaphor pilots trying
    to ambush members of PIE Inc. en-route to the facility. A mixed squadron of approximately
    eight vessels attacked the loyalists, they were outnumbered almost three to one,
    and they found themselves destroyed and routed by the Amarrian fleet who suffered
    no losses.\n\nAndreus Ixiris was one of the pilots involved in the attack. Ixiris
    belongs to the Federation paramilitary group Mixed Metaphor which focuses on safeguarding
    the ideals of democracy, freedom and individual liberty throughout the cluster.\n\nWhen
    asked why they attacked the convoy, he elaborated; \u201CI attacked the PIE convoy
    along with my friends in the Ushra'Khan, despite the overwhelming odds against
    us, because a statement has to be made. I have taken a stand. It is bad enough
    that slavery exists within the Amarr Empire. I cannot tolerate the thought of
    the Amarr canvassing poor souls in Gallente space for their twisted abuses as
    well.\u201D\n\nWhen asked if this signaled the start of a similar campaign that
    led to Ushra\u2019Khan destroying the previous SPCS facility, he answered; \u201CSir,
    I'm afraid that is something I cannot comment on. Classified information, you
    understand...I do hope that such a campaign will take place. The SPCS when taken
    out of context appears altruistic, but in the context of the bigger picture, namely
    slavery, it's really only a slightly less degrading and demeaning experience for
    the victims. It should be opposed in any form, and that is why the Ushra'Khan
    and I took to the skies today, to fight and die protesting against it.\u201D\n\nWith
    such intense objections to Port Sanctuary, it is clear that its continued safety
    could be in jeopardy. Rodj Blake, executor of PIE Inc. clearly put forth his views;
    \u201CI have no doubt that there are those who would try, but having seen for
    myself the defences of this magnificent facility I am confident that it can withstand
    the most brutal attacks. We saw tonight a new chapter for both the SPCS and the
    wretched souls who inhabit the Federation. There are those who seek to prevent
    the SPCS from carrying out its work, but tonight their efforts were in vain, just
    as they will be in the future. The terrorists will not be allowed to stop the
    SPCS from preventing cruelty to slaves.\u201D\n\nWith the reactions of both sides
    seen here, it is clear that this event has sparked controversy and fanned the
    flames of the continuing slavery debate. Should those who object to the project
    decide to return with stronger forces in time, there will likely be more than
    simply metaphorical flames to come as well."
