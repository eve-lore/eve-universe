    Heimatar.** Estel Arador's Corp Services [EACS] has been sold at auction for 10.6bn
    ISK. The new owner, Alacta Lithia, took control of EACS operations earlier this
    week following a smooth handover.  \n  \nMs. Lithia of Carniffles Corp [CARNI]
    had by her own admission extended herself precariously in order to remain in the
    bidding: \"I have basically invested all of my spare ISK ... even selling off
    some spare assets to raise the ISK required.\"  \n  \nShe also stated she does
    not forsee any real potential for profit running the EACS service: \"From an investment
    point of view, it will not offer very good returns if the same average from donations
    are recieved due to the price tag.\"  \n  \n\"I decided that I would continue
    to run it as a free service to the EVE community. It was never my view to make
    huge profits from this.\"  \n  \n\"At present it is business as usual, EACS will
    continue to be run as a free service helping all with their jump clone needs.
    Estel (Arador) has helped a lot in the transition, giving me useful tips on how
    he handled the business.\"  \n  \nWhen asked if the purchase of EACS represented
    a new stage in her career Ms. Lithia was optimistic: \"Currently I have no plans
    for additional services and I am very much an unknown. But it was a thought that
    had crossed my mind; that the running of EACS would definitely raise my profile
    and at least be a name that some would recognize.\"  \n  \n\"So we will see what
    opportunites come up in the future, and what possible additional services I could
    start to offer...\"  \n  \nOutgoing CEO and founder, Estel Arador, declared himself
    satisfied with the outcome: \"I do think the final price is fair. I had expected
    to get 10 billion, it turned out to be just slightly more.\"  \n  \nHe also stated
    his delight the service will remain free for the foreseeable future: \"I am very
    pleased. As I've stated earlier, I believe it is a very important service for
    new capsuleers and I'm happy they'll still be able to get jump clones without
    paying a large fee.\"  \n  \n\"I hope everyone will continue to enjoy the services
    of EACS for a long time to come.\"\n\n### GalNet References\n\n[WTA: EACS (finished)](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1396907)
