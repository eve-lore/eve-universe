- body: "Welcome to Day Six of the **Fifth Alliance Tournament**. Here are the results
    and reviews of the next six matches of the day. \n\n* * *\n\nThe Quarter-Finals
    \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 89: Notoriety Alliance Vs Cry Havoc.**\n\nNotoriety arrived
    on the field once again in Sansha ships, with Cry Havoc. also falling back on
    their tried and tested Dominix formation.\n\n**Notoriety Alliance:** 2 Scimitars
    | 3 Phantasms | 2 Sentinels | Rifter  \n**Cry Havoc.:** 3 Dominix | Guardian\n\nFocusing
    hard on Guardian, Notoriety tried to force their way into an early win. Cry Havoc.\u2019s
    Dominix denied them the Guardian kill however, utilizing the versatility of the
    Dominix to provide ample logistics assistance. Smartbombing Notoriety\u2019s drones,
    they turned on the Scimitar, dropping it too fast before anything could be done.
    From there, they applied pressure on the remaining logistics as they took out
    the Phantasms and eventually the logistics itself. A convincing and efficient
    totalhelldeath win from Cry Havoc. whose masterful use of Dominix may just see
    them taking the Cup home. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 90: Ev0ke Vs HUN Reloaded**\n\nA
    straight out brawl this time around, with both teams fielding setups that were
    risky and left the outcome uncertain. Ev0ke came out strong in the face of HUN\u2019s
    fearsome 10 Rupture formation and came away with a decisive win.\n\n**Ev0ke:**
    3 Tempests | 2 Maulus | 5 Griffins  \n**HUN Reloaded:** 10 Ruptures\n\nQuickly
    dispatching a Rupture in exchange for a Griffin of their own, Ev0ke looked disciplined
    and unphased. The pattern repeated itself for some time, with HUN losing Ruptures
    in exchange for Griffins. By the time they had lost 4 Ruptures, only removing
    3 Griffins, it was clearly the end for the reigning champions. Another impressive
    showing from Ev0ke, who have repeatedly shown the capability to turn matches in
    their favor. They will face Cry Havoc in the semi finals. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match
    91: Triumvirate. Vs KIA Alliance**\n\nTriumvirate. was one of the tournament favorites
    having delivered strong wins consistently. It was anyone\u2019s match as they
    faced off against KIA, who looked like they were on fire and ready to pull out
    a cup-winning performance. The match was an absolute tussle, with TRI slowly pulling
    ahead late in the match.\n\n**Triumvirate.:** 2 Guardians | Curse | Rook | 2 Thorax
    \ \n**KIA Alliance:** 3 Megathron | Firetail | 5 Griffins | Maulus\n\nTriumvirate.
    fielded their previously-used Recon-Logistics against a team looked set to challenge
    it, and that they did. KIA looked aggressive and confident from the beginning,
    putting heavy damage on the TRI Curse and switching rapidly over to the Rook,
    showing some readiness to test the TRI setup. TRI worked away at the KIA Support,
    but it wasn\u2019t long until the Rook was in deep trouble, eventually dropping.
    With things now looking grim for TRI, they kept their composure and removed the
    rest of the KIA support at the cost of a Guardian. They then turned their attention
    on the remaining KIA Megathrons, using their Thorax to keep them pinned and away
    from the remaining Guardian. It started to level out at this point, as the TRI
    team slowly whittled down the Megathrons, using the tracking disruption and capacitor
    warfare of their remaining Curse to great effect. Their own Guardian was gradually
    slipping towards hull, but too slowly for KIA, who found their Megathrons slowly
    crumbling and a chance at the Cup fading away. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 92: The Kadeshi
    Vs Pandemic Legion**\n\nA clash between two unpredictable teams, Kadeshi finally
    met their end at the hands of Pandemic Legion, who once again showed they can
    pull out the match-winning performances when they need them.\n\n**The Kadeshi:**
    5 Vexor Navy Issue | Guardian | Kitsune | 2 Griffins  \n**Pandemic Legion:** Armageddon
    | Curse | 2 Guardians | Vexor Navy Issue\n\nWith a Griffin almost removed from
    the field by Armageddon alpha-strike in the opening phase of the match, it looked
    like Pandemic was determined to pressure their opponents and take control. Taking
    some damage on their own Guardian, they switched up fire on to a Navy Issue Vexor,
    taking it down rapidly as the logistics failed to provide the needed support.
    Spotting this weakness in the logistics chain, PL capitalized on it ruthlessly
    and started dropping Navy Issue Vexors. With the field slowly cleared and only
    logistics and support remaining to be dispatched, The Kadeshi had no answer to
    PL, and saw their opponents move on to the Semi Finals. \n\n* * *\n\nThe Semi-Finals
    \n\n* * *\n\n**Match 93: Cry Havoc. Vs Ev0ke**\n\nEv0ke had progressed to the
    semi finals with style, having decisively beaten both the Caldari loyalists of
    The Fourth District and the reigning Champions HUN Reloaded. They looked like
    they were having a good night, having used two differing tactics for two good
    wins. Coming into their fight against Cry Havoc. it was unclear what tactic would
    come next. They fielded just the right counter for their opponents, timing their
    late-game plan to perfection as they secured a place in the Final. \n\n**Cry Havoc.:**
    3 Dominix | Guardian  \n**Ev0ke:** Abaddon | 2 Guardians | Curse | Ashimmu\n\nThe
    match started with a ranged battle, the Ev0ke Abaddon exchanging long-range shots
    as Tech II Cry Havoc sentry drones returned fire. For a long time stalemate formed,
    with both sides testing each other. Ev0ke slowly worked away at a Dominix however,
    seeing that applied pressure on it was a weak point. Their capacitor warfare-heavy
    team looked like it could break the Dominix in the face of a tough logistics chain.
    Cry Havoc. held on with time ticking down, waiting until they forced Ev0ke\u2019s
    hand again and cleverly timing a crucial smartbomb to destroy a wave of ECM drones.\n\nWith
    6 minutes left and the Dominix troubled once again as it dipped under half armor,
    Ev0ke needed to quicken up the pace and drop the Dominix quickly for a points
    win and a shot at the finals. At 5 minutes the Dominix was bordering on hull,
    struggling to keep itself out of trouble as armor was frantically repaired. With
    the 1 minute call just around the corner, the Dominix slowly slipped away, a final
    smartbomb removing more drones. It was all too late however, and too much time
    was left to Ev0ke who took it apart for a convincing points win. \n\n* * *\n\n**Match
    94: Triumvirate. Vs Pandemic Legion**\n\nTriumvirate were looking strong all night,
    having claimed two solid wins against some very tough opponents. On their path
    to the final it was unclear if they would finally change their setup or stick
    to what had worked so far. \n\nBoth teams switched up their strategy in this brutal
    tussle for a spot in the Final however, and Triumvirate came out strong with their
    new tactics. They delivered yet another convincing win, showing that they were
    more than worthy of their chance at the Cup. \n\n**Triumvirate.:**   \n**Pandemic
    Legion:**\n\nWith TRI losing their own support early on, it was questionable if
    they could survive a long running match with just battleships against the Bhaalgorn
    and Tempest. They persisted however, trying to wrestle an advantage out of what
    support remained. A Megathron pinned the Bhaalgorn down as the battleships beat
    on the Guardian. It started to drop rapidly under the immense firepower and things
    started to fall apart for Pandemic Legion. Ev0ke wiped out the next Guardian with
    ease, the Tempest and Bhaalgorn falling quickly after. Triumvirate secured their
    place in the final with Ev0ke in style, with a dominating and fast victory. \n\n*
