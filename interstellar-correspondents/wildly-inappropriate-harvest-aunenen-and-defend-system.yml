    Eden capsuleers who choose to enter the solar system have suffered great losses
    at the hands of Wildly Inappropriate, whose occupancy for financial purposes continues.
    \ \n  \nFo Shizz, Fleet Commander and Chief Operating Officer for Quiet.Storm,
    a member of Wildly Inappropriate, explains the financial benefits of Aunenen,
    \"We are doing this [occupancy of system] simply to fund our titan without taxing
    our members, we make about 3-5 [billion ISK] a week here. Believe it or not, we
    make more ISK here than ratting.\"  \n  \nHowever Wildly Inappropriate's presence
    within Aunenen has not gone unnoticed, as Fo Shizz explains, \"PL uses a covert
    cyno to gank one or two of us, but no significant damage has been done, the rest
    of the local anti pirates have met our capitals and were sent home accordingly.\"
    \ \n  \nSYLIBRA, a member of PL explained their reasons for interfering in operations,
    \"Our intention was to bait their supercap fleet in and then decimate it, thereby
    boosting our flagging morale after our horrific losses in venal.\"\n\n* * *\n\nAre
