    \ by ISD Caiden S'or\n\n**Syndicate, New Eden** \\- As most pod-pilots are aware,
    one of the most recognizable events in New Eden is the Alliance Tournament. This
    event brings together many of the best pilots in New Eden for three weekends out
    of the year to decide who gets bragging rights (and some substantial prizes) as
    the best combat pilots around. It is quite an event, one which is unmatched in
    scope and following. Many Alliances have dedicated groups of pilots who train
    year-round for the opportunity to participate in, and hopefully win the event.\n\nOne
    such Alliance, Rote Kapelle, decided that a good way to train for the Alliance
    Tournament was to have a contest between their neighbors in Syndicate.  \"They
    ran a fairly successful tournament with a handful of teams here,\" states Bacchanalian,
    a member of Stimulus Corporation in Rote Kapelle, \"...and that prompted the idea
    of a larger scale event that included teams from across [the cluster].\" Thus
    was born, the Syndicate Competitive League.\n\nThe SCL has run three prior tournaments
    this year, with the intent that this will become a monthly event. As far as the
    quality of the teams involved so far, it should be noted that the final match
    of ATXI between Hydra and Pandemic Legion was actually a rematch of the final
    of SCL3.\n\n**SCL4 is slated to be run on the 14th and 15th of September** with
    12 teams participating this month. As the event will be run monthly, this should
    give much more opportunity for pilots across New Eden to participate. Aegon Blackfire,
    Community Relations Manager for the SCL points out,  \"It's a very good way for
    a smaller group of friends, who maybe are spread out across EVE in different alliances
    to get together and cut their teeth in tournaments.\"\n\nFor the most part, rules
    governing the Alliance Tournament are being used for match play, with a few exceptions.
    One of the main restrictions is on the use of rare ships, such as previous Alliance
    Tournament awards; they are not allowed. The rules will also be fluid and re-evaluated
    each month for consistency. 12 teams will gain entrance to the tournament brackets,
    with a roster of 25 pilots per team; however, only 10 pilots per team will actually
    enter the arena for each match. The remaining roster can be shuffled and pilots
    changed between matches.\n\nAside from the tournament itself, pilots everywhere
    will be able to enjoy watching via live stream and can see recognizable faces
    and voices as previous ATXI commentators Bacchanalian and Apathetic Brent (also
    from Stimulus in Rote Kapelle Alliance) will be on hand for the play by play each
    day. They are also planning to line up guest commentators to fill in between matches
    with interviews.\n\nWhile it is one thing to setup and have teams show up to fight
    it out, the technical work behind the scenes to bring the match to the public
    is another matter completely. Namamai, another member of Stimulus Corporation,
    has handled the camera-work for SCL2, 3, and now for 4.\n\n\"He [Namamai] has
    to both watch the macro and micro battles to ensure we're getting the best pictures
    to the viewers without missing the actual strategic actions that are taking place.\"
    points out Bacchanalian.\n\nSCL3 had upwards of 1500 viewers during the tournament,
    and the team is now more comfortable with the process. \"We've gotten comfortable
    with the nuts and bolts of it now,\" Says Namamai, \"we're mainly working on making
    it faster and smoother. Less time between matches, faster updates of brackets,
    and doing it more often.\" One other positive sign that they are ready for more
    is that the tournament slots have increased from 8 to 12 with SCL4.\n\nFor Information
