    Frontier. That is until a few days ago when the G Alliance aided by it\u2019s
    family of IRON and Razor popped up to set up shop in the area. \n\nThe weary peace
    was shattered when the, until recently friendly, comrades in arms came to position
    a G Alliance owned POS in Ascendant space. Ascendants reply to this brash act
    of defiance was one of extreme force in deploying not one but five Dreadnought
    class ships to engage the POS. As expected the POS\u2019 shield began to fail
    quickly and the technicians responsible for it\u2019s care had to place the station
    into Reinforced mode until fleet reinforcements could be mustered to defend it.
    \n\nWe witnessed many running battles between the forces of Ascendant Frontier
    against the hostile fleets of G Alliance, IRON and Razor Alliance. When Cmd Woodlouse,
    Cataclysm Enterprises of the G Alliance was interviewed during a lull in the fighting,
    he explained the presence of all three alliances as a pre-emptive strike against
    ASCN after intelligence of growing hostilities. He went on to explain the bond
    between G, IRON and Razor. \u2018If any of those entities are threatened, the
    other 2 will help, we are like a family\u2019. When asked where this action is
    leading long term the reply was: \u2018Time will tell, its in ASCN\u2019s hands
    now and until they learn. They know what we mean!\u2019 Cmd Woodlouse showed his
    _\u2018respect\u2019_ for the Ascendant Frontier commanders who managed to field
    the five Dreadnoughts in as a response to tackle the POS in the first engagement.
    However when we were present \u2018G\u2019 turned the tide and there was no sign
    of a single dread on either side. \n\nWe managed to catch up with Adhamhnon, a
    fleet commander for Celestial Horizon Corporation of the Ascendant Frontier. While
    clearly preoccupied with the tasks at hand he was very clear that Ascendant Frontier
    was not an expansionist alliance but merely claiming the areas of Impass and Feythabolis,
    which they have protected against minor _\u2018Mercenary\u2019_ incursions for
    many months already. He clearly stated that: \u2018Tonight's battle is the largest
    in a culmination of events between us, the G alliance, the IRON alliance and associated
    allies of them.' When questioned whether ASCN would be calling in reinforcements
    to deal with these multiple alliance threat the offhand reply was: \u2018We have
    no plans to call in allies at this time. We feel confident in our capabilities
    to defend our territory. He went on to say: \u2018 We feel confident in our ability
    and determination to push back any invading force, and will fight for every inch
    of ground in our space.\u2019 Clearly ASCN is here to stay and is willing to pull
    out all the stops to defend its area of space. \n\nWhile on the battle front there
    is at present no clear victor, the sight of five dreadnoughts on the first night
    and a firm presence of both \u2018G\u2019 and family together with the resolve
    of ASCN it looks as if the battle is far from over. \n\nWe shall no doubt be reporting
    further on this situation as it evolves."
