    to refurbish the club after it was ravaged by an unexplained fire. The proprietors
    Bressty Chastaine and Paul Giselle have been busy since opening night promoting
    the nightclub as \u201Cthe premiere nightspot for hedonism in the Federation.\u201D\n\nFollowing
    the destruction of the club some six months ago, it was thought by many that the
    infamously decadent Cats Whiskers was doomed to fade into obscurity like so many
    other pleasure hubs scattered throughout the Gallente Federation. It was only
    after securing a deal with a group of Federation-based investors that it was restored
    and overhauled into an even more opulent establishment than it\u2019s previous
    incarnation. \n\nTo celebrate the reopening, owners Paul and Bressty organized
    for the eminent Halo Axegrinder of Starved Fedo to make a guest appearance. Unfortunately
    Mr. Axegrinder was unable to perform due to what his managers later stated was
    \u201Can unexpected and sudden illness.\u201D Ms. Chastaine replied however, that
    he was \u201Cunexpectedly lightweight and suddenly drunk\u201D; suggesting perhaps
    that the celebrated rock star was a little too enthusiastic with his own celebrations.\n\nDespite
    the lack of Halo\u2019s performance, the many capsuleers that attended the opening
    night seemed not to mind, as the drinks and entertainment flowed freely regardless.
    In an impressive financial display, Ms. Chastaine awarded a Vigilant-Class Cruiser
    blueprint to a Mr. White Templar, who with many other pilots had taken part in
    one of the competitions of the night. Relative to most Gallentean nightclubs advertising
    budgets, the prize represents a vast sum of ISK, showing just how serious the
    owners of the Whiskers are about putting it back on the map. \n\nThe Cats Whiskers
    has enjoyed early success since reopening, frequently drawing large crowds including
    a sizeable capsuleer base, most of whom are fast becoming loyal patrons. Tainting
    this initial accomplishment however has been rumours of underhanded activities
    happening in the bar, such as illegal narcotics sales. Ms. Chastaine has vehemently
    denied the reports however, and stated in no uncertain terms that such things
    are strictly prohibited in the club. \u201CWe are the centre of hedonistic pleasures,
    that is for sure, but we do not cross the line into illegal activity. It\u2019s
    not smart, and I doubt it is even profitable either. I\u2019ve had my own struggles
    with drugs in the past and I want them far away from me, my girls, and my patrons.\u201D\n\nDefending
    her against the allegations, some capsuleers have contacted the Interstellar Correspondents
    to confirm her words. One pilot who wished to remain anonymous stated, \u201Cat
    the first sign of boosters in her club Bressty became infuriated\u201D, threatening
    \u201Cextreme repercussions\u201D and confiscating the contraband. \u201CShe certainly
    seems to want to keep her club clean\u2026at least in that regard,\u201D the pilot
    remarked. \n\nIn spite of the slight controversies since reopening, Bressty and
    Paul remain upbeat about the future success of the Cats Whiskers. \u201CI\u2019m
    no stranger to a little publicity,\u201D stated Bressty, \u201Cits all lies of
    course\u2026someone trying to damage me, but even the negative stuff helps us
    get the name out there\u2026having a perfect reputation is bad for business in
    my line of work anyway.\u201D\n\nThe Cats Whiskers is open most days of the week,
    and can be located at the basement level of the sole station in the Balle system,
    Disier constellation. Pilots can expect good music, good drinks and good company.
    Those looking for small time work supplying goods are encouraged to contact Bressty
    or Paul at the club during business hours."
