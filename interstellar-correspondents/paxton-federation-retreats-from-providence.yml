    \ \n  \n\"We have lost this war and we'll be pulling back, further major actions
    would be a futile gesture,\" stated Randall Alba.  \n  \nPaxton Federation's opponents
    comprised capsuleers from several of Providence's new inhabitants: Ushra'Khan,
    Star Fraction, Chaos Theory, Opticon, Legio Astartes Arcanum, Daisho, Sodalitas
    XX and several other entities. While Paxton Federation consists of about 600 capsuleers,
    attackers numbered in the thousands.  \n  \nDarenell of Opticon Alliance, confirmed
    his scouts have monitored Paxton Federation's retreat and added that a shift in
    Paxton's fighting pattern confirms they are on the move: \"we were seeing them
    field heavy fleets in the 100-200 pilot range... lately we have started to see
    several smaller fleets in the 20-50 range, mostly comprised of skirmish ships.\"
    \ \n  \nWhere Paxton Federation will relocate to is still a mystery. According
    to Randall Alba this is still a matter of discussion.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected
