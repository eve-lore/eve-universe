    issued a [call on Galnet](\u201Dhttp://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=682557\u201D)
    for the residents of Solitude to join together to rid Solitude of pirates. He
    mentioned Notoriety Alliance, Red Skull Alliance, and the Soul Cartel Alliance
    as being the main culprits. \n\n\u201CAurora Security and the rest of the residents
    of Solitude have grown tired of these brigands and their allies,\u201D he said.
    \u201CThis is a call to all of Solitude to join ranks and show these low life
    punks that Solitude is not their playground. This call also goes out to the (Solitude)
    community that borders on Syndicate. We need to teach these pirates that preying
    on innocents is punishable by death.\u201D \n\nThe situation in Solitude is not
    a simple one. When contacted for an interview, Darqnite of the Soul Cartel Alliance
    agreed that a coalition is needed to deal with the pirate problem in Solitude
    but he classified The Cyrene Initiative as part of the problem. \u201CThese people,\u201D
    he said, \u201Copenly flaunt the traditional rules of war and attack anyone and
    everyone.\u201D \n\nXxKatharsisxX and XxTiggerxX, the actual leaders of the Soul
    Cartel, do not deny that they are pirates. They point out, however, that they
    live in a region other than Solitude and that they only make forays into Solitude
    from time to time. \u201CUsually if we enter Solitude,\u201D they said, \u201Ceveryone
    hides.\u201D They went on to say, \u201CActually Aurora Security isn\u2019t much
    of a threat to any pirates in the area\u2026 so actually the initiative surprised
    us; we didn\u2019t take it that serious.\u201D They concluded our interview by
    shouting, \u201CPIRACY FOR LIFE.\u201D \n\nKavu of the Soul Cartel said Dumonte\u2019s
    Alliance should \u201Cfeel free to visit us, but do so at your own risk, we will
    not be responsible for lost or damaged ships.\u201D \n\nBeyond the corporations
    and alliances that The Cyrene Initiative charges as being pirates, Dumonte mentioned
    an individual pilot by the name of SK Rooster. \u201CSK Rooster is a problem the
    region can really do without,\u201D he said. \u201CGetting killed by SK Rooster
    has become a rite of passage in Solitude. You are not a true resident until he\u2019s
    killed you. He\u2019s a good tactician and he knows how to play with and force
    people into making mistakes. He is really good at what he does, but he can be
    stopped.\u201D \n\nS.K Rooster responded to Dumonte\u2019s comments about him
    by saying, \u201CI have noticed that several different corps and alliance have
    been working together against us. Honestly I don\u2019t think they can stop me
    as it would require them moving into our space for at least one month in force.
    The best they can do at this point is to get better at scouting, and minimize
    their losses.\u201D When asked how he felt about being singled out as an individual
    he said, \u201CI don\u2019t mind it at all, if they want to send all their forces
    after me, great; it would be even better if they were to come into our space and
    then I could show them some other tactics.\u201D Rooster gladly accepts being
    called a pirate and says, \u201CI will keep doing what I\u2019m doing and no one
    can stop me.\u201D \n\nMoridin Bashere of The Red Skull Alliance responded to
    Dumonte\u2019s call for anti-pirate operation by simply saying, \u201CBring it
    is all I have to say.\u201D KingRizen, also with Red Skull, suggested that Dumonte
    and his allies \u201Cshould buy their way\u201D to good standing with Red Skull.
    \n\nThough non-pirate organizations are attempting to coordinate their efforts
    to put a stop to the piracy in Solitude, the pirates are confident that they hold
    the upper hand. Time will tell if the rampant pirate problem in Solitude can be
    brought under control. Until then, pod pilots should use extra caution when entering
    the low security systems within Solitude."
