    last month, control of the region shifted significantly as Fatal Ascension expanded
    and consolidated their holdings and the Deklein Coalition, with support from their
    allies in the Northern Coaltion, pushed heavily against Ev0ke and Ewoks.   \n
    \ \nDuring 10.112, 17 systems within Cloud Ring reported sovereignty changes,
    a considerable increase compared to the previous three months in the region.   \n
    \ \nDuring the final days of last month, Ev0ke had lost control over five systems,
    losing three systems on the 31st October including 5S-KNL to [Test Alliance Please
    Ignore](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Test_Alliance_Please_Ignore_%28Player_alliance%29),
    OU-X3P to Fatal Ascension, and W-4NUU to Goonswarm Federation.   \n  \nGoonswarm
    Federation had taken over control of four systems by the end of October, including
    F7C-H0 and W-4NUU from Ev0ke, FD53-H from Ewoks and B-DBYQ from Dead Terrorists.
    \  \n  \nOn the first day of this month, there were five sovereignty changes within
    Cloud Ring; two losses a piece for Ev0ke & Ewoks, and one gain for Fatal Ascension.
    \  \n  \nEv0ke still holds substantial territory in Cloud Ring, but the influence
    of the [Northern Coalition](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Northern_Coalition)
    and their Deklein allies has grown substantially in the region. While Fatal Ascension
    made small territorial gains in the region over the last month, their system Z-Y7R7
    passed today into the hands of Northern Coalition allies [Sev3rance](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sev3rance_%28Player_alliance%29).\n\n*
