    7 hours, Chribba's lottery has ended and the owner of a brand new Erebus titan
    has been announced.  \n  \nSales \"really kicked up, selling loads every minute,

    to drawing the winning numbers immediately.[![Hinata, The First Prize Winner](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3232/hinatathumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F3232%2Fhinata.png)
    \ \n  \nThe first prize ticketholder, a very surprised Hinata, said: \"I thought
    the lottery wouldn't be till next week... [and] when I read Chribba's mail I was...
    very happy and a bit shocked.\" She had bought just five tickets for a total of
    50 million ISK.  \n  \nHinata, who is not skilled enough to fly the Erebus, is
    going to sell it to her alliance. She hasn't yet decided what to do with the ISK,
    but she will probably use most of it to buy combat ships.  \n  \nSecond place
    winner, Favst, received a Moros dreadnought while the third place winner, Semso,
    received a Thanatos carrier.  \n  \nIn the end, Chribba felt that the lottery
    \"was a huge success.\"  \n  \nIt is still too early to know whether this was
    a once-only lottery or if there is a 'demand' for additional ones of the same
    kind, Chribba acknowledged: \"too common isn't always good, so it needs a bit
    of cool down either way.\"\n\n \n\n**RELATED SOURCES**\n\n[Chribba Announces Lottery's
