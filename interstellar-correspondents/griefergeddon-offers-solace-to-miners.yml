    Heimatar** \u2013 GrieferGeddon, the anti-Hulkageddon event, has concluded with
    an increase in participation and interest.  \n  \nThe continued successes of Hulkageddon
    has caused many industrialists and miners across New Eden to stay docked up during
    the event for fear of loss of their mining barge. Mechanoid Kryten, founder of
    GrieferGeddon created the counter-event so that miners could feel a little safer
    while conducting their work.  \n  \nFor the event, Mechanoid Kryten gathered more
    than 5 billion worth of ISK and prizes to award participants who spend their time
    killing those that are targeting mining barges for Hulkageddon. The event attracted
    more than 80 pilots in this counter-event and counted 140 kills not assisted by
    CONCORD. Mechanoid Kryten said: \u201CIf all the carebears of New Eden stood up
    instead of docking up, we would be able to stop Hulkageddon, but I have no belief
    that will occur. What matters most to me is that piots see there is a resistance.\"
    \ \n  \nThe first place prize of 1.35billion ISK and an Ashimmu blueprint was
    awarded to Amael Galenus. There was 500 million ISK of that prize was apart to
    be awarded only if the winner killed more than ten pilots. Amael almost had it
    all in a single moment when he had the good fortune of watching several Destroyer
    class vessels deploy from an Orca in preparation for a mining belt assault. He
    approached the fleet and smartbombed, nearly securing the 10-kill achievement
    in a single blow. In regards to the success of GrieferGeddon, Amael said: \u201CI
    can say with full confidence that GrieferGeddon has saved a few ships and it does
    make the life of the Hulkageddoners that little bit inconvenient and uncomfortable.\u201D
    \ \n  \nMechanoid Kryten recognises that the statistics of the GrieferGeddon only
    amount to one tenth of that of Hulkageddon IV. However, stats are not what the
    event is about. The way that GrieferGeddon gives back to the community is by encouraging
    miners who would otherwise be holed up for an entire week. An anonymous fan expressed:
    \u201CGrieferGeddon really gave me something good, in the literal sense, to focus
    on.\u201D  \n  \nThe next GrieferGeddon promises to be even bigger. Prizes are
    already being pledged in amounts greater than this latest event. Mechanoid Kryten
    believes that the inclusion of transport and industrial ships as targets for Hulkageddon
    will also help drive more pilots into participating in the next GrieferGeddon.\n\n###
