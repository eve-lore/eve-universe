- body: "**Y113.05.01 - Y113.05.31.**  \n\nThis month has again been dominated by
    the on-going war between the Drone Region Forces (DRF) and the Northern Coalition
    (NC). After rumours of an organised retreat by the NC from the regions of Geminate
    and Vale of the Silent with the intent of fortifying the Tribute region, all stations
    within the largely abandoned regions have fallen to the DRF. The changing hands
    of these regions has however not been without loss for the NC; the NC-aligned
    alliances which inhabited them previously have fallen in number by more than five
    thousand capsuleers.\n\nThe EVE Central Bank has noted that insurers have been
    feeling the increasing cost of this conflict, with over 25,000 capsuleer ships
    and structures being destroyed in that area during the month of May. CONCORD reports
    on these ship losses indicate that the DRF were behind the destruction of over
    half, with around 6,000 losses being caused by the NC. Large numbers of neutral
    entities have also been getting involved in the conflict, enjoying the opportunity
    to attack groups from either side of the war.\n\nIn the south of EVE, elements
    of the DRF have lost a substantial amount of territory to alliances taking advantage
    of their military presence being held up in the north of New Eden. Against ALL
    Authorities and RED.Overlord have led the takeover, capturing both the Omist and
    Tenerifis regions so far.\n\nSpeculation on capsuleer communication channels indicate
    that the DRF forces who have lost this territory have no significant plans to
    mount a defence, choosing to focus on the northern battlefront. This decision
    could largely be attributed to the much higher value of the newly conquered territory
    in the north, with that area being the home to most of the incredibly valuable
    and highly sort after Technetium-laden moons within known space.\n\nJune looks
    set to be the most active month so far in this war. The DRF seem set to begin
    attacking what has been nicknamed \"Fortress Tribute\", the capital region of
    the NC. \n\n_For an explanation of what CORPS is and to find links to past CORPS
