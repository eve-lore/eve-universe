- body: "**Molea** \u2013 Two months ago, we brought you the [story](http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=1755&tid=2)
    of Azia Burgi and her cemetery in Molea. Since then it has been discovered that
    the secure caskets are suffering from sub-microscopic deformations which have
    irreversibly weakened their structural integrity. This damage has probably been
    caused by spatial phenomena and so the decision was taken to relocate the cemetary
    to an area where it could be protected to some extent by a starbase shield. The
    New Eden Cemetary starbase tower has been erected above the first moon of Molea
    II. \n\nIn a small ceremony, at 1800 local time, Azia Burgi interred the first
    corpse at the new cemetary. A small gathering of pilots listened while Azia gave
    the following speech. \n\n\u201CI'd like to thank you all for coming along. It
    has been a tough couple of months for the cemetery project, with the news of the
    [casket] limitations and then the trouble with...the tower, I'm truly grateful
    to everyone that has helped me out over the last two months, especially Davien
    Kaahtt, for taking time to set up the corporation and [constructing] the tower.
    I haven't got anything else to really do other than to [inter] the first grave
    in this new chapter of the New Eden Cemetery.\u201D \n\nProblems with the construction
    permissions delayed the original deployment of the starbase tower, pushing back
    the planned move a week. Once the problem was fixed the tower deployment went
    as scheduled. \n\nAzia estimated it would take one or two weeks to move the 500
    plus graves to their new resting place. It will be no small task relocating the
    graves. However, that didn\u2019t seem to deter Azia from moving forward. \n\nWe
    asked Azia how pilots should get in touch if they would like to help with moving
    the graves or donating essential materials such as starbase fuels. \n\n\u201CThey
    can either [convo] me or mail me. I've removed the CSPA charge on mailing me so
    they shouldn't have a problem getting through to me. I accept all conversation
    requests, so if they don't get a reply from me it means I'm busy.\u201D Azia replied.
    \u201CIf people wish to donate those things they will be gratefully received.\u201D
    \n\nAzia is also considering granting Mausoleum status to large donors. \n\n*
