    for months in preparation for New Eden's premiere tournament. Who will take home
    [the prizes](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/eve-online-news/at-xv-prizes/)?
    Watch the action over all four weekends starting July 29 to find out.\n\n##  Tournament
    Times\n\n[As mentioned earlier](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/eve-online-news/at-xv-schedule/),
    Alliance Tournament XV will take place over four weekends. Each weekend, the stream
    will start at these times:\n\n  * [July 29-30: 13:30, first match at 14:00 UTC](https://twitch.tv/eve_nt_tv)\n
    \ * [August 5-6: 13:30, first match at 14:00 UTC](https://twitch.tv/eve_nt_tv)\n
    \ * [August 12-13: 14:45, first match at 15:00 UTC](https://www.twitch.tv/ccp)\n
    \ * [August 19-20: 14:45, first match at 15:00 UTC](https://www.twitch.tv/ccp)\n\n\n\n[The
    full match schedule can be found here on the community website](https://community.eveonline.com/community/alliance-tournament/schedule/).\n\nThe
    first two weekends will be broadcasted by [EVE_NT](https://eve-nt.uk/) on their
    twitch channel over at <https://twitch.tv/eve_nt_tv>. EVE_NT also have an excellent
    collection of articles and videos regarding the tournament and the teams fighting
    in it that should not be missed, as well as analysis of the Feeder Rounds that
    took place in June.\n\nEVE_NT is also hosting a viewer party at Antenna in Nottingham,
    United Kingdom. If you're in the area, you should grab a ticket and join them
    for all the fun and action from the tournament. [More details can be found here](https://eve-nt.yapsody.com/event/index/110006?ref=ebtn).\n\nThe
    final two weekends will be [broadcast by CCP](https://www.twitch.tv/ccp) from
    our studio here in Reykjavik Iceland, where we'll be covering every match with
    the help of a team of [expert player commentators](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/eve-online-news/at-xv-feeder-results/).
    Make sure you're there for every match as this is when the best teams will be
    bringing everything they have to the table to win.\n\n##  Show your colors\n\nThis
    year we are adding some new ways for you to show your support for the Alliance
    Tournament. First up is a new IGC themed background for your character portrait.
    This is available for free to every pilot in New Eden right now, so show your
    support by grabbing it today.\n\n![](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/73266/1/93608389_256.jpg)\n\nAdditionally,
    we will be offering IGC themed SKINs for the entire line of Serpentis ships in
    the New Eden Store. We'll be rolling out a different group each week starting
    July 25, starting with the Violator and Daredevil SKINs.\n\n[![](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/73266/1/IGC_Serpentis_1920x1080.jpg)](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/73266/1/IGC_Serpentis_1920x1080.jpg)\n\nJuly
    25 - Aug 1\n\n  * Violator IGC SKIN - 55 PLEX\n  * Daredevil IGC SKIN - 110 PLEX\n\n\n\nAug
    1 - Aug 8\n\n  * Vigilant IGC SKIN - 110 PLEX\n  * Vindicator IGC SKIN - 250 PLEX\n\n\n\nAug
    8 - Aug 15\n\n  * Vehement IGC SKIN - 390 PLEX\n  * Vendetta IGC SKIN - 390 PLEX\n
    \ * Vanquisher IGC SKIN - 390 PLEX\n\n\n\n Aug 15 - Aug 22\n\n  * All 7 IGC Serpentis
    SKINs will be available at the above prices\n\n\n\nAs a special bonus, we'll be
    offering the complete set of SKINs from July 25 for only 1525 PLEX. This is great
    if you want to either grab all the SKINs, or want to grab some early.\n\nAdditionally,
    we'll also be offering a bundle of IGC SKINs offered during the previous EVE_NT
    Championship containing the Cormorant, the Caracal and the Drake. If you've been
    eyeing other pilots enviously that managed to pick them up the first time, make
    sure you grab them when they're available from August 15 to August 22.\n\n##  Billboard
    Blitz\n\nIf you have skills with making videos, you'll be pleased to know we have
    a contest just for you. The Independent Gaming Commission is commissioning the
    creation of advertisements to be played on billboards across New Eden to promote
    the upcoming tournament, and is now accepting submissions from Capsuleers. They
    will be selecting four videos to be played on billboards, and as a reward are
    offering 1000 PLEX and IGC SKINs. Details are as follows:\n\n  * [Videos must
    follow all normal rules for billboard submissions](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/eve-online-news/billboard-submissions-are-now-open/).
    Note that the Fancy UI used for the tournament broadcast is permitted in videos
    if you wish to use footage from tournament matches.\n  * Videos must promote the
    Alliance Tournament. Part of the judgement of videos will be on how well they
    promote the tournament\n  * Videos may also contain promotion of a team participating
    in Alliance Tournament XV\n  * Videos may not include promotion of player entities
    not involved in Alliance Tournament XV\n  * Videos must be submitted to [logibro@ccpgames.com](mailto:logibro@ccpgames.com)
    before 23:59UTC, 2017-07-30\n  * Please include your character name with your
    submission and email it from the email registered with your EVE account\n  * 1000
    PLEX and a complete set of the IGC Serpentis SKINs will be awarded for the four
    best videos as judged by CCP. Each person may submit and win with more than one
    video.\n  * Video creators may find the following two images useful: [Alliance
    Tournament Logo](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/73266/1/AT_Generic_Logo_1024.png);
    [IGC Logo](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/73266/1/49_128_1.png)\n\n\n\nWe
    are also still taking submissions for ads during the Alliance Tournament broadcast
    itself. If you're interested in seeing you, your corporation, or your alliance
    up in lights, make sure you check out [this forum post](https://meta.eveonline.com/t/advertise-on-eve-tv-during-alliance-tounrnament-xv/3513/3)
    with all the details.\n\nThat's all for now. As always, we look forward to seeing
    all the teams compete and having the community join us to see who comes out on
    top.\n\nOn behalf of the Tournament Team\n\n-CCP Logibro"
