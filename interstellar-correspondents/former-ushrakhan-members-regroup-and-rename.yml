    Providence** \\- At a time when Tarac Nor has expressed his wish to leave the
    past in the past, the former corporations of Ushra'Khan have moved on and created
    a new alliance.  \n  \nFlying under the new name of Damu'Khonde [USHRA], the former
    corporations of Ushra'Khan have united and are looking to show that they are as
    strong as ever.  \n  \nEmrys Ap'Morgravaine, diplomat for USHRA, revealed that
    the leadership not only remains intact but they have picked up past members too:
    \"After a few days of excellent company with Circle-Of-Two, we have completed
    the transfer of most of our core corporations into the new alliance, along with
    some older very dear friends re-joining alongside.\"  \n  \nAs they move forward
    after the disbanding of Ushra'Khan, Emrys stated that there are new security measures
    in place so that a repeat situation \"will not happen again.\"  \n  \nDespite
    what has happened, Emrys claims that confidence is high even though they have
    had to begin a new alliance: \"We are to a degree remarkably lucky. We haven't
    lost our sovreignty, we haven't lost our station.\"  \n  \nIn regards to HYDRA,
    they now consider them to be \"blood enemies\" and Emrys revealed that they \"look
    forward to seeing them on the battlefield\".  \n  \nEmrys did not have anything
    to say about Tarac Nor, but instead finished with a moment of contemplation: \"All
    of the members of Damu'Khonde hold a great deal of affection for the Ushra'Khan
    name, and that history will be treasured always.\"\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected
