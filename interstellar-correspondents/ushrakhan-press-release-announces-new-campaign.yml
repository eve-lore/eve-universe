- body: "Ushra\u2019Khan, an alliance of Minmatar freedom fighters, has recently announced
    their campaign against Amarr slave traders: \u201CThis day our warriors set course
    for the dark centre of this beast\u2019s lair. We are bound for Amarr itself!\u201D
    \n\nThe press release continues with four entities specifically named as targets;
    Kingdom of Redemption alliance, Order of the Black Cross alliance, Aegis Militia
    alliance, and CompleXion Industries corporation. \n\nKarn, explains: \u201CWe
    chose three overt Amarrian supporters who our scouts reported worked regularly
    for Amarrian agents and traded in the Amarrian empire hubs. In addition to this
    the Order of the Black Cross were declared upon to facilitate removal of their
    star bases as we aid our brothers in the Wings of Maak who have single handily
    brought the Black Cross to its knees. CompleXion Industries were chosen as they
    stood out above all other corporations living and operating in Amarr space for
    mission running for Amarrian agents.\u201D \n\nUshra\u2019Khan pilots have been
    preparing for this campaign for some time now. In addition to attacks in the Amarr
    system itself, they have been tasked with disrupting mission running hubs and
    the key supply pipelines across the Amarrian Empire. \n\nUgleb, in clarifying
    the goal of the campaign, stated: \u201CThis is an announcement of a fresh campaign
    opening a new front. Attacking supporters of the empire where they live. Our pilots
    are already in the area engaging the foe and actively targeting slave transports
    to recover our people.\u201D \n\nOther pilots had different feelings on the matter
    entirely. As Xavian Vaar , a non-combatant responding to the public release, observed:
    \u201C\u2026regardless of whether slaves are killed when a bestower explodes,\u2026you
    are engaging and destroying civilian transports in Amarr space with the sole intention
    of making off with the cargo; cargo legally sourced, sold, transported and bought
    within the Empire. Even if slaves were contraband, you are not the duly appointed
    law enforcement officials for the Empire and have no rights to engage and destroy
    (or attack by means of boarding action, for that matter) civilian or even military
    shipping for any purpose, let alone the confiscation of legally transported commodities\u2026
    Justify it any way you please, but they are the very definition of piracy.\u201D
    \n\nTraak, CEO of CompleXion Industries, says that, \u201COur producers, tower
    operations, etc, are always ready to weather a storm. Our diplomatic channels
    are always prepared [as well]. Our miners have no way to weather a storm and so
    several have left the corp.\u201D \n\nIn regards to the declaration of war, Traak
    feels that \u201CThey [Ushar\u2019Khan] clearly don't have the right information
    to make a good decision. We have some Amarr mission runners, but we also have
    members who run Minmatar and Gallente, so it feels a little... misguided. We don't
    have a [fighting] force and we're not going to pretend we do... we'll just lose
    ships. This war will end in one of two ways: through diplomatic channels, or they
    get bored.\u201D \n\n* * *\n\nGalNet Source Information  \n[Original Press Release](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=767682)"
