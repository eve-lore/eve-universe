    on the HYDRA logistics ship. By match end, only a HYDRA Vindicator was left alone
    among the wreckage of 19 other ships.  \n  \nAll was not as it seemed though...
    \ \n  \nAfter the match, it was revealed that the Outbreak. team was actually
    an additional tournament entry of HYDRA RELOADED. As Duncan Tanner explains, \"If
    people are wondering what the true final was, it was Darkside. versus Outbreak,
    that was the true final.\" He refers to the last fight before the Final in which
    DarkSide. was defeated by Outbreak. This was confirmed by Zarathustra of Outbreak.
    who stated that \"Everyone should realize this was one team that won first and
    second.\"  \n  \nTournament prizes include 50 copies of an Amarr-hulled heavy
    assault ship called the Vangel and 120 billion ISK awarded to HYDRA RELOADED,
    and 50 copies of an Amarr-hulled assault ship called the Malice plus 50 billion
    ISK to Outbreak..  \n  \nIf what HYDRA and Outbreak. participants say is accurate
    about being one and the same team, this means that HYDRA RELOADED may now have
    as many as 150 ultra-rare ships (including last year's 2nd prize Utu assault ship
    blueprints) and close to 200 billion ISK in their war chest.  \n  \nMatch reports
    and statistics are available on the Interstellar Correspondents' website.  \n
