    destroyed with the help of a Nyx and Aeon from Cry Havoc.   \n  \n**11.05.112**
    Kaaputenen - First recorded incursion into capsuleer space. This was followed
    by incurions in Frarn, Renyn, Ashab, Eystur and Urlen.   \n  \n**12.05.112** Balle
    - No information currently held.  \n  \nNiarja - Approximately 50,000 citizens
    abducted.   \n  \nTama - Archon-class carrier deployed by Nation forces - Estimated
    100,000 citizens abducted.   \n  \nKamela - Imperial Navy commander gave orders
    for all allied pilots to open fire on the Minmatar who only moments before they
    had considered fleet mates.   \n  \n**13.05.112** Incursions took place in Auga,
    Penirgman, Gyng, Abudhan and:   \n  \nUmokka - Evidence of Sansha communications
    scrambling technology. Colony on planet 2 in the system totally wiped out - Estimated
    150,000 citizens abducted.   \n  \n[![Sansha's Nation forces are engaged](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3889/fleetthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3889/fleet.png)**14.05.112**
    Intaki - Comfirmed deployment of 2 carriers by Nation forces.   \n  \nPenirgman
    - No dropships, believed by many capsuleers to be a diversionary attack whilst
    Nation forces prepared to invade Teonsude system.   \n  \nTeonsude - Estimated
    150,000 citizens abducted.   \n  \nArnon - CONCORD pilot had ship destroyed by
    capsuleers after the vessel's commanding officer Sutola Endoma who told the pilots
    \"Any conversation regarding the situation that may or may not have happened in
    Arnon is strictly forbidden.\" Endoma also refused to vacate the system when ordered
    to by the Federal Navy.   \n  \nHek - Estimeated 25,000 citizens abducted with
    no CONCORD presence recorded at the scene.   \n  \nVevelonel - Two capital class
    vessels in hostile fleet.   \n  \n**15.05.11** Odatrik - Estimated 25,000 citizens
    abducted.   \n  \nTama - Slave Tama01 appeared for the first time, piloting a
    Wyvern-class supercarrier that was destroyed by forces from Cry Havoc, Rote Kapelle
    and Advocated Destruction amongst others. Many have pointed out the correlation
    between the Nation's first use of a Caldari-originating capitals and supercapitals
    and extraordinarily rapid elevation of the slaves from Tama to capsuleer status.
    Taken from the planet raided in Tama only a few days previously, the True Slave
    capsuleer Tama Slave01 returned to the system and talked to capsuleers in local,
    stating \"Master has allowed me to return, to speak. We plan to uplift humanity.
    To correct the mistake that is the capsuleers.\"   \n  \nMelichor Duraldi asked
    Tama Slave01 \"\u2026By what means do you create your wormholes?\" to which Slave
    Tama01 replied \"That is not for you to know\" , which makes many capsuleers believe
    that they do indeed have the technology to either create or control wormholes.
    \  \n  \nIntaki - The latest incursion (at the time of writing which included
    two capital vessels was repeled various capsuleers, including a Nyx and Aeon from
    Cry Havoc.   \n  \nThe Intaki incursion happened in the small hours of the morning
    of the 15th. While capsuleers have many theories on means to predict the time
    and place of the next incursion, no-one has yet publically announced any successful
    insight, save that target planets to date have all been temperate in climate.
    \  \n  \nWhen the next raid is due, if there is a next one, no-one knows, but
    capsuleers and naval forces remain vigilant.\n\n* * *\n\nAre you affected by the
