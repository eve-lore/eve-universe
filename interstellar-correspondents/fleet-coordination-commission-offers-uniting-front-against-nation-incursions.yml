    **Deltole, Sinq Laison** \\- Sansha's Nation incursions have increased both in
    frequency and force since the end of last month. Sansha dropships removed large
    populations from Oruse, Serren III and Josekorn, while the collective efforts
    of opposing capsuleers successfully routed Nation forces from Deltole and evacuated
    Anyed VII and Antem IV and V before Nation forces could attack. One corporation,
    the Fleet Coordination Commision [FCORD] was founded to offer a fast and intuitive
    way for capsuleers to create and coordinate large fleets to oppose the Sansha
    attacks, whether they are members of large alliances or operate as independents.
    \ \n  \nCreated in 04.112, when the first large Nation assaults began, FCORD arrange
    standings with any pilot who contacts them requesting access to FCORD defence
    fleets. Registered pilots can then find FCORD fleets instantly through their Neocom.
    \  \n  \nDuring the Deltole battle, while approximately 650 pilots were present
    at the scene, FCORD's leader Grideris said \"The FCORD fleet only numbered about
    85 at its peak\" but went on to say that FCORD processes an average of 15 new
    applications each day, steadily increasing the numbers their defensive fleets
    can bring to bear.   \n  \nAn organised defence allows specific, strategic tactics
    to be employed by fleets opposing the Sansha. For example, earlier this year,
    [Operation Bad Moon](http://www.eveonline.com/ic/track/Lists/News%20Articles/www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=3906&tid=7)
    discovered that gravimetric disruption could be used to destabilise the wormholes
    Sansha fleets use to move to their target systems. \"At Deltole, we had a full
    squadron of 11 ships all focusing gravitons at the wormholes,\" Grideris stated.
    \"This made a massive difference to the number of ships that Sansha were able
    to deploy at once\".   \n  \nWith Sansha incursions frequently occuring in low
    security space, many pilots prefer to work only with their own organizations or
    those they know well, but for those with no affiliations, Fleet Coordination Commission's
    system may well offer a way for one man or woman to make a greater difference.
    The fight against Sansha Nation is not expected to end soon.\n\n### Galnet References\n\n[Sansha
