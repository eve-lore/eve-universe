- body: "The ubiquitous BIG Lottery, known universe-wide as the longest running and
    most successful of capsuleer-funded lottery franchises, is approaching an historical
    milestone this March 12th, when it will run its 100th draw. Despite the disappointment
    of a last-minute sponsorship withdrawal, it is expected that many will nonetheless
    celebrate what will be an epic landmark in almost four years of New Eden\u2019s
    capsuleer gambling history. \n\nThe key figure behind the success and history
    of the lottery is Tornsoul, who as CEO of BIG has been running the event since
    its inception. She shares her thoughts on its history, what it is today, and what
    we can expect on the 100th birthday in the following interview. \n\n\u201CThe
    BIG Lottery is about giving people that shot at riches beyond belief, something
    we all dream of,\u201D commented the Intaki. \u201CIt\u2019s an affordable price
    to enter and it\u2019s also a lot of good fun at the actual drawings, we get quite
    a lot of regulars attending. [They] are actually pivotal for the draw\u2026no
    people, no draw.\u201D Speaking about the lucrative nature of the typical lottery
    franchises and the notable successes the BIG Lotteries in particular have enjoyed,
    she remarked \u201Cthe lottery is in the red, always has been\u2026it\u2019s about
    having fun, not making ISK. The ISK we could make would be negligible anyhow\u2026in
    fact draw #99 was rather unique\u2026it was the first time ever, I think, that
    a regular round had a profit.\u201D \n\nSpeaking of the changes since the lottery\u2019s
    foundation she reminisced about the prizes given away in their first official
    draw: A Vexor-Class Cruiser and skill book \u2013 a prize reflecting the long
    history of the lottery and in stark contrast to the 20 Billion ISK offered in
    prizes for the 100th birthday. \u201CWe\u2019ve been doing it non-stop for 99
    weeks now,\u201D she stated. \n\nWhen asked of the plans set in place for the
    100th draw, she explained that she originally envisaged something even larger
    than a 20 Billion ISK draw. \u201CI\u2019ve been planning #100 for about half
    a year and have really been looking forward to it\u2026I had been talking to a
    sponsor about getting some very special prizes\u2026that only this sponsor could
    pull off\u2026four days before the start of the round, they suddenly and unexpectedly
    pulled out\u2026it was quite devastating.\u201D Regarding the current ISK pool
    she further added that, \u201Cprizes are preliminary, I hope we can come up with
    something a bit more unique and interesting to mark the occasion.\u201D She appealed
    to the capsuleers of New Eden to step forward and contribute in light of the recent
    disappointments, and in doing so \u201Cimmortalize themselves in Eve history\u201D
    as a sponsor listed on their winnings boards on one of BIG\u2019s most special
    days. \n\n\u201CThere\u2019s one person above all others that comes to mind,\u201D
    she stated, when asked if she would like to thank anyone. \u201COmber Zombie\u2026the
    unluckiest guy in the universe, it\u2019s a standing joke among the regulars\u2026Oz
    has played every single round of the BIG lottery and has never yet won\u2026while
    other regulars like Johnnny B have won four times!\u201D As the date approaches,
    it is expected many people will take a punt and get their chance to win one the
    super-sized prizes, even if only to partake in a part of New Eden\u2019s history.
