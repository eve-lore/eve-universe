    Lunaire Elois\n\nHot on the heels of the invasions of TDSIN and Gambrini's home
    systems, the political world of Wormhole Space was once more thrown into state
    of chaos when Lazerhawks CEO Hidden Fremen disbanded the neocom channels 'Join
    W-Space' and 'Rainbow Knights'.\n\nFounded over a year ago by Hidden Fremen, Rainbow
    Knights served as \"an arena for discussion and to help corporations who want
    to grow and be prominent w-space entities.\" according to Fremen. The channel
    was host to several well-known corporations residing in wormhole space, along
    with a few lesser known entities. Rainbow Knight also holds a list of known corp
    thieves, spies and AWOXers accessible to all the representatives to keep unwanted
    characters out of wormhole space.\n\n[![](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/67441/1/IC01.jpg)](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/67441/1/IC01.jpg)
    \ \n_Sleeper Social Club, Odin 's Call. and Unsettled. respond to a Rainbow Knights
    call from Hole Control about several tackled Carriers_\n\nIt had become commonplace
    amongst the representatives of the channel to request assistance when attacking
    something that was too large for a single corporation to take on. An example most
    often seen is when a corporation with relatively low activity manages to tackle
    capitals and needs to not only fend off the capital ships, but the ensuing reinforcements
    from the local nullsec power bloc.\n\nAfter a year of activity, the channel was
    abruptly closed and deleted by Fremen. \"I closed Rainbow Knights because, after
    a while, it became a channel where people would just link killmails, not even
    related to w-space,\" he said.\n\nAxloth Okiah, a director of Sleeper Social Club,
    has resurrected the efforts of the 'Rainbow Knights' channel. Now known as 'PraiseBob',
    Okiah claims that neither Rainbow Knights nor PraiseBob are engaged in efforts
    to unify Wormhole space (one of the frustrations Fremen cited in his closure).
    Okiah claims \"I still think wspace is less blue than it was some years back.
    Nowadays it's mostly operational temp-blueing, which is ok I think.\"\n\n\"I think
    [Rainbow Knights] has helped to make wormholers into a coherent community.\" Okiah
    continues \"Which I consider to be a good thing, but not everyone would agree
    with me on that.  The transition to a new channel was pretty smooth, even the
    original WH Overlords to Rainbow Knights transition was smooth and without drama,
    so I guess that shows that wormholers tend to be quite a mature and chill community.\"\n\nSince
    its establishment, PraiseBob has seen just as much, if not more, activity than
    Rainbow Knights with more and more corporations being brought into the fold."
