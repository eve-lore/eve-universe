- body: "Arcane Technologies regretfully announced that they had to cancel their eagerly
    anticipated \u201CInter Alliance Industrial Cup\u201D because of lack of interest.
    The Cup was scheduled for today.   \n  \nFor all the hype and interest which this
    sparked, no teams decided to participate, leaving the organisers disappointed.
    However, that is nothing compared to the millions of extreme sports enthusiasts
    who were preparing for what they saw as the biggest sporting breakthrough since
    the mind clash and SplinterZ.   \n  \nHowever, some have pointed out that the
    cancellation is not entirely unexpected. The Curse Alliance has been losing members
    at an alarming rate; whilst the Fade Union has disbanded and the Northern Star
    and Phoenix alliances have been troubled by BoB, of which ATUK is a member.   \n
    \ \nThis still leaves a large number of alliances who did not register a team
    for this competition. Whether this has set a precedent for other such event failures
    in the future remains to be seen."
