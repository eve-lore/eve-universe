# EVE Universe

This repository synchonizes with the
[EVE Universe API](https://universe.eveonline.com/api/), allowing users to
observe changes as they happen on the Universe site. This synchronization 
happens on a set interval, and the data you see in here, while likely 
accurate, might be somewhat outdated.

For the most accurate version of the data, you can always view it directly
on the [EVE Universe](https://universe.eveonline.com/), or query it directly 
with the Universe API, or with tools such as
[Universe-CLI](https://github.com/eve-lore/universe-cli).


# Reporting issues

This repository has the issue tracker enabled. This issue tracker is there so
that issues with the EVE Universe can be reported. Since the publication of EVE
content uses different procedures, we can (at this point in time) not process
pull requests related to the actual content of the EVE Universe.

Reporting and suggesting changes specific to the synchronization mechanism is
always welcome.
